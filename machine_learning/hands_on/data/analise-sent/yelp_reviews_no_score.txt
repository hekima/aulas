I love Marilo  She understands my hair type and knows exactly what to do with my hair  She keeps a record of my previous visits  She recommends what is best for my hair  She is pleasant to work with: easygoing friendly and respectful  I've been going to her since 2008  I'm really picky with hair people and I used to go back to Chicago for haircuts  Now I stick to Marilo.
I went to this Petco a few times and was a bit appalled at their rodents section to be perfectly honest Granted it wasn't as bad as it could have been but in my opinion it was unacceptableFor one thing there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was what    1' x 9" 1 x 8" Don't quote me on that - I'm not 100% sure but regardless of the details it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it They weren't unhealthy they didn't look very sick but they definitely didn't look particularly healthy either The guinea pigs were what really shocked me though If you know anything about guinea pigs you'll know they need a lot of space - even just for one This cage was the same size as the rat's cage (they all were) They barely had enough to room to walk much less exercise or popcorn (which my guinea pigs do often) There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing when it was way way too small for one baby guinea pig It also didn't look that clean - all the cages in my opinion were grungy The whole place felt grungy and grimy And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday which they should be doing It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each dayThe prices are indeed pretty good or at least better than the prices at the Petsmart I usually go to so there's one point for Petco At last the employees Are they nice and cheerful Yes That is until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy (I was trying my hardest to be polite although I could have come across as rude) they (or the one I talked to) immediately turn defensive telling you "it's very temporary" and "we take them out every night" (which I don't believe but maybe a Petco employee can correct me on that) and make a face at you not once telling you they'll tell their manager (even if they won't) or you may be right like a good employee wouldWant your customers to come back Here's a good tip: don't tell them they're wrong about something and rudely correct them obviously trying to rush them out Humor them even if they are wrong about somethingOverall I would recommend not shopping here They don't take good care of their pets and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly don't Good prices They don't make up for thatI apologize if I made this too long and thank you if you read all of this regardless of whether or not you agree with me.
I love coming to this bar Friendly bartenders and a beautiful view.
Great sushi rolls and BYOB  Very friendly staff  Three for lunch $25 per person including a generous tip  Love this place.
The sushi is amazing  It is made daily in the store by an authentic sushi chef  The rolls are more beautiful and delictable than in most actual sushi restaurants  Pricing is good too 12 piece brown rice spicy tuna for $799 beats most happy hour pricing and the really fancy rolls are typically $8-$10  The produce selection is broad as well including an all organic sectionThey also match competitor coupons  I use the $3 of off $30 from Fresh and Easy when I go thereThey also have good prices on wine (larger selection than some wine stores).
Ok so the grand opening hasn't even happened yet for this place but sorry Im gonna miss it  NotA group of eight of us show up tonight for "dinner" and drinks  We get seated way the hell in the back  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd  Two graphic designers three filmmakers a photographer and some friends ok  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca so the people are well less classy The guy was digging himself a holeSo we order drinks which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole everyone else orders something a bit similar  Conversation is picking up while we wait for our food  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives Probably about 45min later  Here's the best partSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old  That's right each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max  patheticAfter our tiny little dinner we ask for our billsThe waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once no instead he brings one or two at a time Guess he wants us to stick around Who knows Finally the two filmmakers get their bill pay and they leave couple other of our friends do the same  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit guess how much Oh about 50 cents He signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy placeThe place actually does look pretty cool  Too bad the service sucks and the food is barely appetizer quality at best.
I love Stereo Joe I had bought a new radio thinking I could install it myself That was a disaster I went to Joe and it did it cheaply and quickly He is also the nicest guy I felt really good about supporting this small business Joe is a great guy and very helpful  When he installed my radio he also fixed my broken car clicker at no extra charge Wow  I felt like he genuinely cared about helping me more than he cared about my money.
Great food and atmosphere  Plenty of TVs to watch the games  Chef Patrick Fegan and his partners of TK Urban Tavern in Scottsdale Quarter just opened this great location  Pumpkin Soup with pumpkin oil and croutons is such a great start to the Fall season  Wood fired oven pumping out flatbreads  Sweet Potato gnocchi made in house with roasted corn and gorgonzola crema is unbelievable  Very impressive selection of beer handles and delicious cocktails   Amazing view of the sunset as well  Can't wait to return.
This place is great I love their mint chocolate chip yummmy They have a bit size cup for 299 and it always gets loaded up love it.
This place is amazing I come here at least once a month & am never disappointed Food & service is always great The buffalo burger it TDF as well as the bruschetta Outside seating is so cute with a lights (great for date nights) live music inside is a wonderful touch This place is great to meet with friends family or date night It's truly a Scottsdale must.
I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
I Love LOVE this place- and while I currently live in Chicago next to the Baron of Japanese Markets- Mitsuwa I love this place even more Although it is not as large as Mitsuwa and doesnt have the same variety service is spot on and the prepared foods are deliciousI ended up buying a nigiri plate and an unagi dish served on rice.
I thought this Sweet Tomatoes was brand new when I walked it  Very Clean and everyone was friendly and attentive  The staff at this location are a class act    The salad bar and it's topping were well maintained and fresh  I especially liked their array of pasta salads  The Tarragon and Tuna and the Asian Peanut were my favorites  I am a soup lover and could spend my entire meal there alone  I got a second ok a third helping of the Spicy Sausage with Pasta and beans  Pizza was good as was the hot pasta selection  I definitely plan on coming back here again and againeven though it's not the closest Sweet Tomatoes to me it is by far the best I've been to in the Valleykudos.
Why is everyone else writing their reviews on the listing on Hanna Wrong address peepsSo I had been wanting to eat here for a while but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants thereSo I came here today on my own for lunch It was pretty easy to figure out how to order (you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings)I got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for  coleslaw and it came toasted I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepperSo I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to So I ignored the size and dove in WOW The bread was so good Toasted without being dry light The meat was perfectly cooked not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place the coleslaw was so good and flavorful juicy without dripping all over the place The chips were also really good Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size It was so good I can't wait to go back.
My boyfriend and I decided to take his son out for gelato yesterday and after seeing the reviews on this place we decided to try it I purchased the fantastic deal available and off we went Once we arrived the person we dealt with was super personable and very helpful she let us try all the flavors we wanted to make sure we would get the one we liked After trying the African Dark Chocolate I knew I'd found my new love It was absolutely delicious My boyfriend and his son are also huge fans We will definitely be back If you haven't checked this place out yet you should definitely fix that :).
I can honestly say this is the most I've laughed at a dinner theatre The cast is witty and very funny I have seen two of their shows now and always wish I had invited more friends I'm so glad they have started shows on the west side too My only discretion if you're looking for a normal conservative show this may not be your best choice It's more out of the box and the interactive but that's what I love about it.
As a local boy from Hawaii I made it a quest to find a place that reminds me of home and after living in Phoenix 4 yrs nowI finally found a place that can subdue my craving for a for Korean style plate lunch Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ L&L BBQ or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad kimchee cucumber kimchee noodles corn salad and seaweed plus a few other choices Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found thisI like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered then pan fried and served with a slightly spicy sauce It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurantsI recommend people to try this place.
Ever been somewhere and had service that just made your morning  A Chinese couple sat down at the booth next to me  The server came up with their food delivered it and then softly asked "um how do you say 'thank you' in your language" They told him (it's 'xie xie' though my spelling is probably off) and he smiled bowed and said "xie xie"His manners his approach and his openness were like a warm hug He could have been brisk and to the point he could have just said "thank you" He could even have been surly He chose to take 20 seconds and reach out to a total stranger I'm not saying this makes CB the best place ever But it sure gave me a smile at the start of a long day and I am very grateful In my ancestral language "tusen tak".
For the past year and a half I've had Whitey's service my car whenever something wasn't under the Infiniti warrantee  And I'm nearly giddy that my warrantee is up so that I can have only JP's eyes and hands on my precious carWhitey's has fit me in whether I was calling the day before or two weeks prior  This isn't for a lack of business (actually the place nearly always seems super busy) but because they genuinely want to make their customers happyI trust that I'm getting honest opinions thorough work and a fair price  Each time JP explains what work he did what work will need to be performed in the near/distant future and the pricing for it all so that I can be prepared for what I'll spend (and avoid finance-induced heart complications)Certainly I could go into greater detail about my various experiences at Whitey's but there's no point when they've all be stellar  Bottom line  They're awesome in all the ways that matter and even some that don't.
When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said REALLY  Well then you are in for a treat  She wasn't kidding  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback) The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4 so we all got to pick and share  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and Warm Artichoke Spread  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself  Anyone who knows me well knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a weekyay.
I love this place I've eaten here a few times now and there is not one thing that has not been above standard When ever we are not sure where to go out to dinner this is our go to place just love it.
We all LOVE Thursdays with Debbie at the bar  She is a keeper.
We went for the Thanksgiving Brunch at the LV Bistro I was excited it included tasty food from all of the Fairmont's restaurants But after the experience I had I won't be back I was under the impression that this was a world class resort however the service we received in the restaurant was below what I would expect at Applebee's Don't get me wrong the property is beautiful The valet's were friendly and helpful providing us directions to the LV Bistro where brunch was held The hostess was friendly quickly found or reservation and we were directed to our table where we sat and waited to be greeted by our server for our drink order We waited and waited 15 minutes after we were sat a woman approached us and asked if we were waiting another to join our party as she began filling a water glass We told her were weren't and we had been waiting for a while She quickly turned and disappeared leaving a half filled water glass (and water spilled on the table) behind Another 5 minutes later a server with a tray of drinks appeared and told us he would be right with us He dropped off the drinks and greeted a table that was just sat A few more minutes passed and a female server greeted us and began taking out drink order and giving us the lay of the buffet when the male server returned to see if we needed anything else Once we got our drinks and found the buffet things went somewhat smoother During this time we realized how cold we were It was about 62 degrees when we arrived and the doors of the dinning room were wide open to the buffet outside Those seated outside got space heaters but inside we got sweeping breezes Not what I would expect from this type of setting I would be much more understanding if the restaurant was busy but when we got there at noon it wasn't In fact countless staff members wandered around the floor diverting their gazes from our hungry and confused stares I wanted to alert the hostess to the situation but was asked not to by my companions I have been a server so I am understanding but this was ridiculous It's a buffet we only needed to be greeted and get drinks There is no reason we should have had to wait 25 minutes to be greeted I was seriously shocked that the manager and hostess making their way past us repeatedly failed to notice this either I expected a wonderful experience and while the food was good the overall experience fell short I didn't feel that it was worth the $70 price to be neglected and freeze.
Great Store Competetive Prices And super good selection of beer for a smaller store.
Awesome place Friendly staff heavenly good pitas fresh ingredients and fast service What more can you look for They have 10% cards for th new customers I'm taking my lunch here few times a week.
great place to go  i was able to get a same-day appt and the doctor was so nice and great  at what he does i'd definitely recommend.
This is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to  I went here for the first time several years ago before the remodel and it was way smaller and not a very memorable experienceHowever with the remodel the facility is AMAZING  They have a beautiful relaxation room where you can lay down with cuddly blankets and read take a nap or eat some yummy snack mixes that are laid out  It has a steam room and sauna and awesome showers with showerheads everywhere  There is also a little outdoor private area with jacuzzi and outdoor showersI had a stone massage which I hoped would never end  When you walk into the room they give you a choice of around 5 different mixes to listen to on their ipod depending on your mood  I thought that was pretty cool too  The staff was very attentive and friendly  I wish I could have had more time to use the gym there too that looked really nice also  I would highly recommend spending a day at this spa  Oh and I think they have a summer special right now where you can show your AZ driver's license and get 40% off  That's a pretty great savings considering it's not a cheap place to get a massageMake a day of it you won't be disappointed.
Got food poisoning off a simple Caesar salad Worst food poisoning I've ever seen When my boyfriend called to inform the manager he didn't seem to care and told us he would get back to us but didn't I work on mill and will never be back If you do go don't get a salad.
First of all I visited this place many times in the past many years They used to be a great place to have dim sum I was never so disappointed like this We walked in today (Saturday at 12:24PM) and was wondering where the customers are Saturday is usually the most busy day for every dim sum places The restaurant is pretty empty out We sat down and order 5 dishes That's where the problem came I don't like to be treated like moron Why there is 6 dishes marked on the sheet We kindly asked manager to check it out Long story short they turn into deny mode And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry Mistake does happen but don't pretend that you don't know it Admit it The portion of the dishes are also shrinking With the price and services I can find better dim sum place Yes I am really picky on the food quality and service Fool me once is enough I will suggest everyone to pay attention on the bill Always count how many items you ordered and how many are marked on the bill I have post pictures as well.
After my experience at Papago Brewery I now spend my time at Four Peaks any time I am in the mood for a good beer I like their Arizona Peach Ale and their Hefeweizen I usually order their veggie pesto pizza or chicken enchiladas I know your probably thinking what I was thinking enchiladas at a brewery They are delicious I always take home the leftovers which are just as good the next day My husband is predictable he always orders the salmon blt Con - I wish Four Peaks had a better happy hour Maybe 1/2 price appetizers which would bring me in more often Regardless I still keep going back.
Great selection of  bakery items sandwiches pasta salads and breakfast items  Everything is tasty and fresh  Order at the cash register station get your drinks and they will bring your order to your table when it's ready  Very comfortable and casual  Has WiFi available  We had breakfast the other morning at a table then moved to several comfortable chairs to finish our coffee and read the newspapers that had been left there Definitely one of our "go to" places in this area.
Yes I will admit that my family watches Triple D  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places  Matt's is a KILLER placeMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spotsThe food is awesome  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning Here is what we had:Pork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly  The pork chop is to die for  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed  Not at Matt's it was tender and cooked perfectly  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually  This bacon would make anything taste great  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble  Once again cooked perfect not greasy at all but with big flavor  We both had home fries which were incredible  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions  Pretty close to perfectThe next day my wife had the waffle which she liked  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm)  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak eggs and hash browns  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often)  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely  The hash browns were very nice  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle  Exactly what you would hope for  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly  It was like butter  Nothing like your store bought jelly  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both morningsAs for the service it was pretty good  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon  Very nice touchOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be.
I have been getting my hair cut & colored by Mia for years  She is the most cheerful down to earth person you'll ever meet  I am picky when it comes new color or cuts but the next day after seeing her I am always ecstatic how awesome my hair looks and feels after trying something new.
Mmmmmm mazing Fried alligator po boy Best service Staff is friendly Great environment I love it.
This is my favorite buffet in all of Arizona  It's really clean bright inside rare for buffets  My favorite things are the little sushi bar crab legs and the teppan table I've never had a bad experience at this place really nice people work here  It's also good for a group of people.
I can't believe the 3 out of 5 ratings This place rocks 4 different mealsall boss I promise you I have no affiliation to the place.
Decided to switch up my usual location Never had it before with past owners but food was fresh and flavours were amazing A little pricy but worth the extra penny.
I have had two bad experiences Call me stupid but I'm trying one last time to support a local business We'll see how it turns out Check back No disasters from last visit but I'm not going back.
So glad I stopped in here Was a last minute check in after I found out I was released from being on call all day In need of a pedi bad and this place is right down the street so I went in at 5pm I went for the ultimate spa pedi (decided to really treat myself) Was not disappointed one bit For 4900 got all the add ons hot scrub hot lotion paraffin wax soak  a hot stone foot massage and the results= two very happy and exhilarated feet My tech was Kevin and he was awesome The place is beautiful quiet and liked the fact that the pedi stations are in back and away from the front Felt very relaxed and soothed Thank you Biagio and Kevin.
How come it isn't in Trip Advisor Excellent shawarma and surprise the "flan" a southamerican desert is the best in the valleyGreat service lovely super fresh just made food.
Obsessed  Ambiance is great service also great  The menu freakin' rules my life  The beverages are always fun and delicious  I had something with lemon and kale and it was so good  Bison Burger is good Salmon is good Ahi appetizer is good although I am guessing every option would be delicious  Lot's of stuff for dietary weirdo's such as myself  My normal boyfriend also loves it  I haven't had dessert but it looks divine  I will re-visit often.
If there was an option for no stars I would have given that Everybody in here was rude today and just seemed like they had something better to do I should have went next door to five guys At least they like their customers Between the first girl rolling her eyes at me and the cashier rushing us to pay we sure didn't feel very welcome.
Oh this place was far from where I was at  The problem with Phoenix is that every place seems like it's located in a strip mall and there are tons of them around here  Well this one was way out in Pima off of Shea but it was worth the trip  They have delicious coffee here  I ordered a caramel cappuccino with non-fat milk and it was very tasty  I saw that they also have a dark roast Colombian coffee and bought half a pound of it  They ground it up for me and it smells so nice and rich  When I think of commercials where the scent of coffee is around and wakes you up I'd want it to smell like this coffee  It's a pretty decent sized coffee shop filled with glass artwork and other little Latin trinkets that they sell  I like the cultural mix and feel of the place  I believe that they host several types of social cultural gatherings  I have seen the website advertise salsa dancing amongst other events  I may have to have my friend bring some of this coffee back if I become addicted  I had to open my carry-on in the plane to get to my neck pillow and my ground coffee was in there and the 2 passengers next to me commented on how good the coffee smelled.
So disappointing The most disappointing part was the service It was fine that they didn't have ribs but the cashier was deliberately unhelpful and unfriendly It turns out the ribs were about 15 minutes way from being finished Sure wish they would have mentioned that because we would have waited Then they failed to clarify whether we wanted a plate or sandwich When the brisket came out chopped up on a terrible soggy cold bun I was so bummed out Apparently I'm not the only one to have had this problem Right before I was about to send mine back another customer took hers back to the counter saying she had wanted a plate and not a sandwich They dumped the meat off the bun onto the plate threw away the bun and handed her back the plate GodThe coleslaw was watery the Mac and Cheese was dried out and the sauce was broken The waffle fries were fine I would have gone back to this place but the service was intolerable What a waste of a meal and money.
Chipotle Fast Healthy or not (depending on what you're in the mood for) I love the consistency of service and quality across locations I grew up in Colorado and have enjoyed many meals at the original location by the University of Denver No matter what location visit you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients I was always a chicken burrito with extra rice black beans corn salsa lettuce and cheese kind of gal Most recently I've fallen in love with the salad Romaine lettuce with all the burrito toppings you prefer My latest creation is chicken fajita veggies pico de gallo corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side I take this creation home put it in a big bowl toss everything together and devour The marinade from the chicken and the juices from the salsa and veggies create an awesome dressing I dip my fork in the side of salsa and vinegarette before each bite providing just the right amount of tang and spice The combinations are endless I dream of Chipotle.
Like no other place in the neighborhood This colorful little restaurant really stands out in Arcadia The patio is just plain WOW  Hanging out at the bar sitting next to the fireplace and enjoying a Coffee beer just can't be beat The food has been great most recently I enjoyed the Ragu which was really great The sauce was tasty and the meat was different than I was expecting but way better than anything else I have tried elsewhere I have also tried a few of their Pizzas and have always been very happy From food and drinks to a great staff this place has really outdone themselves I am a fan and will be back.
Dinner last night was my first visit here and it totally rocked  The risotto with shrimp is a "must have" if you're a shrimp or risotto fan  My friend and I split the dish and they added an extra shrimp so that we would each have the same amountPear salad was great and the spaghetti and meatballs were awesome as well  My boyfriend had the lentil soup and while I'm not a fan he raved about it also.
So excited that Rita's has finally come to the Valley  I grew up on Rita's in PA and always thought it would be a hit in the Valley since we have year round fantastic weather  The staff was extremely nice and were also excited when I told them I grew up with Rita's italian ice  The mango gelati is still my favoriteyummy.
"Bevmodid you see this guy"Total Wine is my booI shall be faithful and loyal to the aggrandizing store in which you are and in which you hold dominion over allR\_Note: dont get tooooo cocky TW.
We have lived in Phoenix almost 8 years and been dying to try Bianco's but wait is always way too long  Recently went to newly opened location and got in within an hour only because we wanted to sit inside (heating up in the valley)  Seating is limited so once it gets really hot I suspect the wait might get a little longerOK the food: appetizer free because of the wait nice touch we had the anti-pasto which was not at all what we expected yet thouroughly delightful Fresh beets baby carrots cheese Sopprosetta and fennel - very flavorful  Pizza was good the crust is really what makes it great toppings were ok my daughter prefers traditional pepperoni and sausage to the local schreiners sausage and supressetta (don't know how to spell)  Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean cream was an excellent end to a great meal  This will probably not be a frequently visited restaurant due to the wait times but we will definately come back sooner than eight years.
I have seen all three doctors (Dr Pham only once in the hospital when my third was born)  Because he was the attending pediatrician I fell into this office and have felt grateful ever since  The doctors are friendly (especially the PA Johanna)  The staff is courteous helpful and really know their stuff  I particularly appreciate their knowledge on billing situations  I have only had to wait once or twice mostly I am seen quickly  I've moved a lot and therefore have had my kids go to a lot of different pediatricians and this is by far my favorite office.
My first visit to Eddie's house was really an exceptional dining experience We were seated a one of the oversized wooden four tops overlooking the patio from one side and peering into the kitchen from the opposite I was facing the kitchen and enjoyed watching the action and seeing all the enticing entrees and apps coming out It was also cool to see Chef Eddie doing his thing back there and working just as hard as any of his employees The decor of the place reminded me of a southern country club: dark rich colors nice but not pretentious and comfortableWe started with two orders of the Mo'rockin shrimp one per couple because they were so highly touted After my first bite I was so thankful we had done so Firstthey tasted incredible So many flavors in one bite- I could lick the plate and die happy Second there are only four shrimp per order and no one deserves only one bite of those delicious little morsels I questioned the biscuit balls at first glance but after splitting one in half and sopping up the remaining sauce on the plate I understood how tasty and functional they were My side of the table split a Caesar  salad that had great dressing but was a tad hard to eat for me because it was not chopped I made lots of noise chopping it myself but still managed to make it work My other half was not pleased with the chopped olives sprinkled on top but I liked the extra favor acidity they added For dinner I had the whole portion of sea bass and it was literally perfect I can't say I have ever had better It was served with some gorgeous and just as tasty broccolini Sharing is a common occurrence among the four diners who were present so I got to taste a little bit of everyone's My guy had "what's in my steak"  which looked like a giant edible softball on a plate but tasted like a big sweet hug from grandma Comfort food extraordinaire  It reminded me of something Willy Wonka would make Crazy looking but scrum-diddily-umptious The tuna and halibut from "east meets west " were both excellent and the golden beet slices that accompanied the scallops were delish Finally for dessert the birthday boy in our group chose the "chocolate pot du creme" Holy mother of all that is chocolate This was amazing It looked and tasted like liquid fudge It was incredibly rich and decadent and perfect to share All of this deliciousness accompanied by two bottles of La Crema Chardonnay  plus my lovely dining companions equalled a five star review and a lasting memory of a wonderful night.
Setting:  We either go before or after church  If we get there early there is definitely more of a selection although we have hit the gem going in the afternoon before they close on SundaysAmbiance:  I would like to say I am somewhat of a donut connoisseur  These deep fried goodness is definitely my weakness  Once you enter you are filled with the smell ofyup you guessed it donuts  They have a great selection a little bar to sit at seating outside and tables inside as wellFood/Menu:  The maple bars are my favorite  They are soft topped off with the right amount of maple and fluffy donuts  They also have small apple fritters that are deep fried on the outside that makes the crunch even more delicious  These are definitely my two favorite donuts but the rest I have tried have great quality and tasteService:  This place is family owned with friendly service  I have not had any problems with serviceOverall:  Well organized and clean compared to other donut places  I am about to drop some knowledge on you Arizonians: the donuts are fresh and they are THE BEST DONUT PLACE I have had in the Phoenix area  If they had healthy donuts I would be here every day  However I will stick to the occasion of 1 or 2 times a month before or after church  We will see you again Rainbow Donut goodness.
Best tortillas around  Authentic and amazing green chili looking forward to next visit.
This place rocks  Great vino great food great atmosphere  If you're looking to impress a date with something more than a bar happy hour this is the place.
Ok you want quick and amazing food that takes you to your childhood even if you're not Mexican Reyes de la Torta will do it I had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with They said it was amazing Once I went I was hooked You're going to get a completely different feel from this place Yeah it's in a strip mall yeah the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to Yeah there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news  but the food will make you not care about any of those things Plus they are always playing Salsa not loud or rambunctious trumpet-filled music This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia When you're asked for your drink order make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas translation: fresh juice I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it  The chips and salsa are good although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan Ok the restaurant is named the king of the tortas  and you ask what is a torta To Mexican people a torta is sandwich of meat vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there But I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else These tortillas are amazing from their texture to their slight greasiness to their taste they are the best tortillas I have ever had So in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever I always get the chicken quesadilla Yep it's simple but amazing You can also choose to get it "Estilo del Rey" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese not crappy yellow greasy cheese) sour cream and green onions That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books Do yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street Make your way up to Sunnyslope and see what the buzz is about.
I eat at Hana's probably two or three times a week  I absolutely love their chicken meal  Its grilled chicken rice pita and a small salad for about 9 dollars  I also love their grilled chicken sandwhich  It's more of a philly sandwhich type thing but sooo good You will not be dissapointedPS I just scarfed the Hana's Mixed Greens salad  Even though there wasn't really a mixture of greens really  it was soooo good Almonds parmasean marinated kabob chicken onion tomato cucumber and lots of cabbage Yum.
I haven't had better pho anywhere in az the large pho is enormous for the price i usually go with my family and order a regular sized pho for myself and a number 45 (beef/rice plate) to share with another person the one down side of this place is that it's located in a little more run down area and the restaurant's cleanliness isn't that great nonetheless their food makes up for it i would definitely recommend this place.
All I have to say is get the California Club I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu The drive-thru concept is pretty neat but there was a bit of a wait Guess you can't rush perfection.
YES YES NY Pizza for sureUpon entering I was greeted by a very nice straight forward lady I made it known that i was visiting from NYC and i heard great things about this place and she said (very confidently) you heard right and you wont be dissapointed Oh boy was she right One bite and i was back in Manhattan Too bad i been eating out of the other "NY" places around here this whole time :( So good I wish you guys the best So mad I only ordered 2 slices.
I came away from my meal (complete with cocktail + dessert) with no guilt Local fresh tasty and healthy cuisine here For the first round order the fig tart I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious and while it was tasty I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time.
Let me be clear and direct in this review: I am a MAN and when I go to Chipotle I do not order a salad or a hand full of chips  I order a BURRITO with MEAT  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle burritos and all food in generalOne of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious  What you don't necessarily know though is the attitude  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty filthy man who hates you simply for being alive and will follow you out to your car and mug you  Nobody knows  Except me because I've eaten at this one several timesThis is a magnificent Chipotle  The people are good spirited helpfully construct your burrito quickly and pleasantly  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like "Eh not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy" and do you know what  I go into this place and everybody is happy and working and it's like "Yeah yeah now I'm feeling a little better  Maybe things aren't so bad  Maybe she still loves me"So to summarize this is a great Chipotle  It's bright friendly ample parking and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.
I had heard about this place for years but never went Tragic I know Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work Oh how i must now make up for lost timePop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff When you come to pops that is what you are looking for product And they have the best selection in town A couple of recommendations Doctor Eli's Blueberry Jackson Hole Huckelberry or really any thing in the Birch Beer section.
I attempted to get my air conditioning serviced here and was quoted 220 bucks just to find out what the problem was Is it because I am female that this was my quote Of course I take my car out of there and go down the street where I was not hustled The guy behind the counter was rude as well to me How this guy is employed I do not know I would avoid this location if you can Huge disappointment.
In order to arrange a upcoming UYE "Butter Party "  Jim  Audrey Donald  Amy B  Heather  and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting  For the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as "waffles and chicken " To be fully prepared for the UYE we ate to our hearts content  I have to be honest and not lie that I fully loved every scrumptious morsel From the yummy waffle tasty chicken  to the  yummy cornbread  it was all good but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese creamy  sublime  rich  crusty in places sharp cheese laced man I really like that stuff I didn't know if I should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later   Kids loved it  waffles and fried food goes over big in our family The service was exceptionally good courteous  well thought out  and  made the place Decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair  Bright and airy  fresh and  comfortable  Love the big old mason jars for drinks  nice down home touch folks   We met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our UYE dreams come true She also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am Simply can't wait to go back Anybody busy tomorrow.
Went inside with my boyfriend around 10pm on a Thursday and it was a ghost town Sat ourselves at the bar and waited five minutes Saw two servers walk into the bathroom but no one greeted us and no bartender appeared nobody came to talk to us Left and went somewhere else RED FLAG.
Love the hungry monk They have a great beer selection and  I love all their food And I love places that do daily specials We always sit at the bar and tiffany martese and heather are all super nice and make sure to take care of us There's one older guy that bar tends who is pretty rude so if we see he's working we just go somewhere else So maybe I'd give the place four and a half stars because of him But overall we love it.
This was absolutely horrible I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats  I threw it in the trash I will wait until I get to my destination to eat Horrible.
This place has the most amazing Gelato I have been there plenty of times and I always make sure that anytime I have friends or family visiting that we make a trip They have plenty of flavors to choose from I was there this past Monday with my sister We met an employee named Nelson who was also a fellow New Yorker After talking to him and experiencing his amazing customer service I can honestly say that this is the type of employee every boss wishes for Nelson was super friendly and made us feel so comfortable and welcome there I love leaving an establishment with that feeling I plan on visiting more often now Thanks Nelson.
Talk about fresh food and great prices this place has it all  When I first tried it I was a skeptic but then I had the food and I was greatly surprised by the good taste and quality of the food  I suggest the Tri Star Mongolian it was to die for   Plus the shrimp fried rice had plenty of shrimp and was good in size too  I order from this place at least once a week and I can make 3 or 4 meals from one entree  Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised of the value and taste  :-).
OK this review is for happy hour only I plan on trying Marcella's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future so I'll update once I doWhen I heard Marcella's was opening at Fashion Square I was so excited Marcella's originated in Columbus Ohio and there are two locations there My Ohio friends rave all the time about Marcella's -now that it is here in Scottsdale I finally could find out what all the buzz was aboutMarcella's is located next to Modern Steak and is in the new Barney's wing Parking is available in the lot across from Grand Lux and if there are no open spots in the evening you can park in the underground garage I met a friend who moved here from Columbus for happy hour last Wednesday night I arrived first and secured us two spots at the outside bar Our bartender Josh (I am pretty sure that was his name) was a sweetheart and chatted with us quite a bit and provided excellent serviceMy friend had the red sangria which she really enjoyed while I stuck with Stella Artois As a note the beers on draft are Peroni or Stella No cheapo American beers here on draft thankfully For food we had the zucchini garlic cheese bread and the pesto shrimp pizza All the food was really good especially the pizza The food was great but what is even better are the happy hour prices The appetizers range from $225 to $495 while the pizzas will run you from $495 to $650 Beer and sangria are $3 wine by the glass is half off and martinis and specialty cocktails are $5 Plus happy hour runs from 3-7 pm so working people can actually make it and enjoy a few drinks Marcella's definitely has the best happy hour deal in town now that it is openI can't wait to go back to try more of the appetizers and to have a full meal Thank you Cameron Mitchell for expanding Marcella's from Columbus to Scottsdale You have made this Ohio transplant very happy.
Before I start my review here's a word of advice: Do not go to Yasu if you're short on time It can be hard to get a table at this little place and the service is kind of slowThat said the food here is amazing I love good sashimi and the salmon sashimi here is delicious The tuna is pretty good too My husband loves the Yasu roll which is tasty but giant and therefore challenging to eat All the rolls are good but in my opinion if you're the kind of person who only likes sushi if the taste is covered up by spicy mayo and eel sauce you might as well save your money and go someplace with low-quality fishThe thing we really go to Yasu for is the black cod You have not lived until you've tried this stuff It's cooked in a buttery miso glaze that compliments the fish perfectly I've had black cod and butterfish at other restaurants but nothing has ever come close to the black cod at Yasu This is a melt-in-your-mouth little-slice-of-heaven kind of treat We always order two when we make the long trek up from Mesa to eat at Yasu.
This place is great I have been here about 5 times I like my stir fry spicy and they have just enough spices for me to mix in with all my fresh vegi's You can fill your bowl up with all the fresh meat and vegi's you want and they add your noodles or whatever you want at the endThe price's are not to bad they are a little cheaper for lunch than yc's and a little more at dinner time but you can get a frequent buyers cardI love this place and will keep going back as long as it's open.
delicious delicious delicious Very good food It's so packed all the time And even the coffee or orange juice is so fresh and amazing.
Excellent breakfast burritos Less than $5 and served all day Whole wheat tortillas now avail Great salsa bar Check in on Yelp for 10% offReally friendly service.
Hula's is the Bomb and all that Ask for Ginger she will rock your world I love the BBQ ribs tacos and the steak Their prices are reasonable and it's usually sets the night off on the right footWasabi Mashed potatoes are delish and would HIGHLY recommend themThank you Hulas for being My friendly neighborhood eatery that is close enough to stumble home from after  few too many Zombie's and Painkillers (Both are adult beverages).
I broke my acoustic guitar string early Saturday morning Called revolver records store and they sent me here for strings I rode my bike up here nice little house that's the business Can't miss it big sign Cool people greeted me no douche musician types that don't want to help you We chatted as they rung me up They told me they also carry vinyls here as well Good prices I'll be back.
The antithesis of Starbucksindependent coffee shop at its finest  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs board games and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 pm)  Americano was unbelievably smooth made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice).
My son and daughter both get thier hair cut here and they always do an excellent job I keep going back.
Ted's is one of the few hot dog joints where the hot dogs actually are better than the pricier sausages But don't get me wrong everything they serve is good I first had Ted's when I was 8 years old and it remains my favorite dog in Arizona Every weiner is perfectly charred over coals And the onion rings are battered and wonderful more like an Awesome Blossom than breaded frozen fast food rings.
This is the very best (and inexpensive) Vietnamese food you can get in Phoenix I cannot convey how flavorful and wonderful and fresh the food is Don't know what you want No problem Just point randomly at the menu and order somethingService: A little on the slow side but the food is so good that I don't care That's a very high compliment from me because I'm NOT forgivingAmbiance: None This place is a dump and I don't care: This IS Phoenix so we're all trash anyway (Especially YOU Scottsdale snobs I KNOW who you are lol) The fluorescent lighting is lurid and harsh on the eyes No music playing It's a miracle that the sagging ceiling didn't fall upon our heads This restaurant is literally on its last legs Very much in need of a remodel and a makeover So put on your dirty soiled wife beater and your flip flops and you're set Da Vang is devine.
Captain Ted is awesome He is so helpful and efficient Our Boy Scout Troop has rented kayaks from him for several years and he always gives us great service He is friendly helpful and his equipment is great quality A pleasure to do business with him.
Drink specials here are absurd ABSOLUTELY great.
This place is great food is great staff is greatBeen there several times and each visit everything is top notchSteak BBQ band serviceLove the view tooOh and yes don't forget the cotton candyOh and the boots boot mugs and boot shot glasses yes yesAnyone visiting Phoenix needs to see the view alsoI personally go back often and take visitors and Friends each time.
I like this place Parking is easy in back Service is good Price is reasonable I like to get the Pad Thai level 5 hot I also like the Fried Rice with Pork I suggest you go  with level 5 heat and lots of water.
Both Market Bistro locations are now out of business.
if you have seven dollars to spend on a sandwich you can get a footlong from Quizno's or Subway or you can get an 8-incher here and realize exactly why you hate Quizno's and Subway The place is marijuana-themed I thought this was cute the first time I came here since I'm from California where it's virtually legal and this was in Arizona where Pot hadn't been legalized yet (Although the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs but that's a whole different story and review)The bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's and their prices are moderately high but well under 10 dollars and completely worth it Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana or something from pot culture I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as "Schwag" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0Other points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden Of course there are stickers everywhere flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area and really friendly staff I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of ArizonaThese are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant And though the place has a very heavy commitment to its theme it avoids feeling gimmicky and the food is definitely the star attraction I make a pilgrimage to this restaurant every time I'm in the area.
WOW~ I just had the best sushi for Lunch that I've ever eaten in AZI ordered the ASU roll although a bit expensive it was really good the Tempura Shrimp roll was one of the best I've had the shrimp was still warm it was so fresh and not only that but you get two pieces of shrimp inside  instead of just one The Tuna nigiri was also super tasty fresh the rice was perfect not too sticky (see pics)After eating all that I asked for a special order (not on the menu) of Tuna  avocado and cucumber rolled in sesame seeds Sushi chef whipped this up for me no problem and stuffed it generously (see pics) I don't remember the last time I saw rolls as full or as fresh as the ones I've eaten here todayMy only complaints are that the host/cashier station is in the center of the restaurant so there they are staring at your every bite(literally) the chopsticks are a bit bigger than normal and square shaped so I found them a bit awkward to use and although I sat at the sushi bar I had very little interaction with the sushi chef other than him handing me my plates the waiter took my order to him there was no piece of paper to mark my choices and hand in like I'm used toAnother thing is most of their rolls are topped with macadamia nuts so I ordered them without no biggie I guessDeliciously Fresh and very well stuffed rolls I could have easily spent $100 on my lunch by I stopped near $40.
The food is excellent I am very picky and I had read the Yelp reviews of others before trying out this place I got the eel bowl which consists of eel slices with a delicate sauce over rice I chose brown rice My husband got the chicken teriyaki He was very pleased with it We will definitely be going back There are a number of items on the menu that I am looking forward to getting The food was prepared perfectly The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was nice.
Delicious pastries good sandwiches great drinks free wifi almost always open - this place is one of my favorites for a quick drink or a full meal All their food is made fresh on site and you can taste that.
Saturday evening 02 September we returned to FnB for the second time in a week - this time with friends along  We had appetizers entrees and deserts - swapped food all around and had one of the best meals that we've had all year  Reservation was ready when we arrived the staff was pleasantly attentive  This locally owned restaurant deserves all the rave reviews that it has garnered in the past 25 years  A must try if visiting Scottsdale  We're lucky - we live here and we know enough to call head for a reservation.
There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list  It's not your average Mexican fast food  It's a little more pricey but well worth it  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good)  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
I have been a patron of the original Lolo's for years and have to admit I like the colorful flavor and mix of people at that location But I live in Tempe and own a business right down the street from the Scottsdale location I went right after it first opened and even though it was so shiny and clean and didn't have the urban feel I love so much I can't deny that the food isn't just as delicious Everything I have ever had on the menu is heart stopping good literally I only partake of Lolo's delight a few times a year but it is always craved.
The meal chosen was tasty but I will not be returning  As a first time patron I was given free muffins with extra proteina bug crawled out of one of the muffins Not sure if trying to sue them is worth the time or money so I just won't return and I'll share the video with others so they are informed It doesn't allow me to attach the video The muffin may have been carrot not sure.
I seriously can't believe I haven't ever written a review of my favorite Mexican place in the entire world Not like this place is still a secret which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere I should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions The problem is I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito so I just end up getting both And finishing both And it's not even difficult These have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist It's just all sadly located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal or in actual Mexico) The wait to order is never very long but the wait to get your food does seem endless It's only because they make everything fresh to order though And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive They have something here that I have never seen beforea Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi they've got it all covered I could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP And if you're heading to NYC bring me some tortillas :).
I wish I would have started this hike early in the morning because the sun throughout the hike is killer  It was my first time taking this on and I started off strong feeling invincible  Not even at the halfway mark I was gasping for air  Pace yourself thank goodness my boyfriend had water and was encouraging  As I kept truckin' I finally see a "stairway to heaven" and I will tell you by no means was it an easy climb to the top of this peak  Steep steps to get to the top but once I got there I felt a cool breeze air took in the most beautiful views and enjoyed a few gulps of water  Back down was much easier but by then I had spaghetti legs  A good reminder to continue to climb and hike to get into better shape  Left with sore legs a great tan and an enjoyable way to start my day  I highly recommend.
Wow We went on 4/20/11 and were appetizer and drink hopping around Scottsdale On our way to dinner we came across this wonderful place Nothing much to look at from the outside but were pleasantly surprised open and comfortable My husband and I sat at the bar ordered a few appetizers: Pork Belly Pastrami and Crab Cakes w/ brussel sprout slawsorry I drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were Thomas our bartender who knew EXACTLY how every dish was perpared and expaining w/ such passion we can tell he loves what he does Next time the reservation will be here Looking forward to trying EVERYTHING Hope Thomas is working.
I don't shop at Banana Republic I never have and I probably never will HOWEVER I did decide to purchase my bridesmaids gowns from Banana Republic and I have to say I have never experienced better retail customer service To make a very very long story short: The dresses I wanted were almost impossible to find I ended up purchasing two from two separate locations and having one shipped from California The associate at this store Vicki personally called and had it shipped for me She was extremely patient and very helpful I was absolutely shocked (and gracious) at the outstanding customer service I received at this store Thank you.
Bombebero's you've won my five star rating I am now a regular for breakfast the last dish was the Uruguayo - Spanish chorizo diced tomatoes roasted red peppers cotija cheese fresh herbs and a splash of chimichurri sauce I can't even describe how delicious this dish is The Spanish chorizoyou use is top notch You've won my heart and my five star review for being the perfect place to dine any time of day You are great to bring out of towners you want to impress with your patio Your cheese selection is fantastic and your overall ambiance unbeatable I think I may go today.
Great food coffee deserts  Also pet friendly on the patio.
I love the food this place serves I had the Bandeja Paisa which was amazing The service is a bit slow but the wait is worth it I recommend this place to any one looking for good Ecuadorian food.
Nice local neighborhood place to come and enjoy  Excellent food  Nightly happy hours and weekend entertainment  I recommend the Swedish sliders.
Had dinner here last night The chicken boti and mantoo were delicious  The eggplant dish was really good as well The place is simple clean and the service was good Our bill was $29  Talk about an amazing deal Will definitely be back.
Real authentic Mexican food Homemade like Been going there since opening day best menudo and pozole in AZ.
I recently went to The Lotus  Acupuncture & Wellness Center for acupuncture treatment from Zach because I had caught a bug that was going around After two treatments over two days I felt almost 100% better while others seemed to have the bug four to five days Treatment seems to have helped I highly recommend.
Myself and a group of around 12 friends were in the midst of a downtown bar-hop in honor of my fiancée's 30th birthday on Saturday November 10th 2012 Many of us were wearing 18th century french aristocrat costumes and were jovial extremely high spirited and looking forward to going into an event being held at this bar Upon arrival the patio-onlookers immediately began to try to get photos with us the people at the door and even security were cracking up and excited for us to be a part of their evening This particular event had a relatively high cover price for some of our party-goers and being that we were going to make up for any type of cover in many birthday drinks (we had spent an average of over $100 at each bar we went to this night) we felt it appropriate to simply ask if waiving the cover for out party would be alright Here is where the first mistake was made - the door people claimed this "had to be brought to the attention of the manager" As a promoter myself if a group of this many people come to your event together (especially those with particularly colorful personalities) you simply encourage their patronage in any way possible 12 people have a lot of friends collectivelyas a bar you don't want to offend them On top of this we knew the party promoters personally and many of the people involved in this particular event and we had made this clear in the very beginningNow for the reason for the dreaded one-star reviewthe managerThe manager was visibly irritated that he had been summoned His first words to us: "Why should I let you into my bar for free" At this point he had been made aware that this was a birthday entourage but aside from that his comment was loud and intentionally insulting We are not rude people and were in the midst of an extraordinary night out so our response was not rude at all We simply said "Well there are 12 of us we're going to be buying many many birthday shots and drinks and we know many of the people hosting this event Plus we look great We're in costume and even your door personnel security and people on the patio are clamoring for us to come in" His response: "I can't just let you in for free what is it that you even do" It was obvious at this point that this man was rigid humorless rude and beyond salvaging our acceptance of just paying the cover and going in (which was never even ruled out) So we started just laughing at how offensive this man was being to us while he attempted to suggest we take our party elsewhere He even went to the lengths of following us out and down the stairs of the public walkway as if to insinuate that we had acted inappropriately and were being escortedGypsy bar - if you read this I hope it registers that someone felt treated so badly by your staff that they were compelled to take the time to write out a review on this site I hope it also registers that your bar earned ONE out of FIVE stars on this site without the person writing it even having to set foot in the door I would highly recommend this establishment to those who enjoy being insulted repeatedly and treated like a third-rate citizen For those looking for friendly staff and a welcoming vibe downtown Phoenix has a lot of options.
F@(& this place  I called several times today to check in on a phone order that should have been delivered a few days ago  The 1st time I called the kid who picked up the phone was a rude little prick and he put me on hold never to come back  I then called several more times only to have their answering machine pick up  I finally got someone on the phone and they tell me that they have no idea when the phone will be there which is really messed up because it has been paid for and when it was ordered they told me the date it would be shipped and the date I would get it  What gives  Never use this place  They should have their contract canceled  Its little shtty stores like this that make Verizon customers switch to other carriers.
Sorry folks this isn't working  We tried a variety of dishes from the menu and nothing was more than meh  Barely there uninspired and overpriced for quality and quantity  Plus our server was one of those folks that maybe should be working in computers not hospitality  Beautiful patio too bad the food doesn't measure up  That said we tried Barrio Cafe at the airport and had a rockin' meal with great albeit slightly wack service  Quality control folks or maybe the Scottsdale crowd just doesn't know the difference :).
This place is really quite awesome I've been here a few times- the most recent time was to get stuff for my last minute Halloween costume And they had it RIGGED up They had these rather intimidating men in security vests (who were actually very nice) directing traffic flow into their lot I got there at the right time- swung up waited maybe 30 seconds for somebody to back out before pulling up and parkingThere is actually two parts to the store On the west side is the costume rental side and on the east side is the actual store itself where you can purchase almost anything you want if it's related to costumes fancy dress and whatnot Service at this place is consistently pretty excellent I've been during peak and off peak During peak nobody bugs you if you don't want help but they are more than willing to help you if you do I was able to get in get a white foundation black eye cream a powder and green spray on hair dye very quickly with the girl's help I went once ages ago as well during off peak for extras as part of a cosplay outfit for a convention The same thing- it was a lot quieter but they were helpful when I wanted them to be left me alone otherwise This place really is a gem They have beautiful wigs all quite a nice quality pretty inexpensively priced Their range of makeup is astounding and they've got all the knick knacks you might possibly need for any outfit I'm sure if you had a particular idea but possibly weren't sure how to execute all you had to do would be ask your salesperson and they'd direct you and give you ideas Since I plan to cosplay for a con again next year I'd imagine I'll be in to get a wig and other accoutrements The interwebs is good and all but there's something to be said for being able to go to a store and see right there what is available Plus I think I might need green lipstick.
This place just tastes GREAT It seems silly how low their prices too.
This place is great Wide open spaces and wholesome food that is more palatable than most For the record--Any place that offers whole wheat substitutes is more than just alright in my book--and The Pita Jungle doesI ordered a Veggie Garden Wrap which consists of zucchini broccoli cauliflower eggplant yellow squash carrots onions tomatoes brown rice mixed beans ginger herbs and garlicon a whole wheat pita of course Based on the price of about $7 I assumed it would be of modest portions but I was only able to eat one half Bravo Pita Jungle you have my heart.
I'm a fan of this small family place My husband and I love to go here and have dinner Their special hummus is always impressive  My husband tells me that their lamb cannot be beat I've had a bite of his and always found it to be very tasty  I've tried so many things on the menu and have never had something that I didn't enjoy  They offer a wonderful happy hour and one weekend a month they have a belly dancer in.
I have always loved Indian food and having tried in several different countries dozens of different restaurants and nearly every meat and vegetarian dish this cuisine can offer I can wholeheartedly say that this restaurant was beyond my greatest experiences with Indian food outside of IndiaYou have to go into the restaurant expecting a family run restaurant atmosphere This is by no means a 5 star restaurant it's a 5 star experience It's like visiting your grandmother's house for a home cooked mealThe chicken Tikka masalas and paneer are all to die for I asked for my dishes extra spicy and after a brief "oh no not Indian spicy" argument from the owner I received my dish just as hot as they would serve it to a native DeliciousThe Garlic Naan and other breads (parantha etc) are great and all deliciously homemadeThis restaurant has been around for a LONG time and if you haven't tried it yet it's a must.
Vadim is a wonderful barber He is eloquent on many topics wine sports restaurants and life in general Great conversation and quiet when he knows you want quiet Try a face treatment and your day will be just fineJohn Gatz.
I haven't had Hong Kong style pot pot since I lived in Manila so I was so excited to hear about Tien Wong Hot Pot It was delicious It's also fun to eat as a family putting different foods into the broth It's a great experience for a meal to share and talk Very cute and chic ambiance Professional and attentive service I will go back again and again.
While I have never dined at this restaurant I am giving this a 1 star for my experience with them over the phone I was trying to order a bottle of sake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday there this evening because I am out of state The hostess was very helpful and went to find the manager The manager told her they could not do it How do you take reservations for your karaoke rooms Over the phone credit cards Basically a lazy manager who did not want to help make a night more special for my friend I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years and that is not hospitality So though I live in LA the next time I visit Phoenix this will not be a place I will be stopping by Great job.
Want experience the perfect evening with friends in old Scottsdale - go here and nowhere else  This place has it together on every category Service ambiance drinks presentation deserts etc Everything we ordered was very creative fun and fresh Not a cheap date but treat yourself to this one.
I found so many good stuff for my Costa Rica trip I almost thought I wouldn't be able to grab any of the good stuff before leaving Seattle and the amazing flagship store I found rei in tempe from a friend I bought most of my essentials such as a gopro rechargeable battery permethrin wash for clothes for bug repellent citronella spray a bandana and concentrated sea to summit wilderness washgood good stuff Although I did come in with the intention to purchase a set of Nikon monarch binoculars They ended up being $350 dollars 100 bucks more than amazon and most online vendors are selling so I opted for the rei versions that came out to 189 Almost half the price and very comparable The service was on point and now I'm a lifetime member.
Order any of the Eggs Benedict and you will not be disappointed I couldn't eat them fast enough Gets very busy on Sunday mornings during brunch time so be prepared to wait It is worth it you will have cravings for the eggs Benedict.
We are definitely regulars at this Nello's location  The service is friendly  We almost always get a nice cozy booth to sit in  The pizza is great and so are the sandwiches  They are really  accommodating when it comes to making special requests  Their house dressing is not just good for salads - get some to dip your sandwich and pizza bites inGood beer list and inexpensive prices You really can't go wrong with Nello's.
Always enjoy the food here especially the brisket cornbread and Mac n cheese Our servers were excellent from the minute we walked into the establishment to the time we headed out.
Have never had a problem with any service on the three cars I regularly bring in for service from my Honda Civic hatchback to Toyota Camry Sedan or even my Mercedes CLK500 They always have me covered at a fair price.
Let me give you the low-down on this jazzy place First: the folks who work there are totally non-judgmental Doesn't matter how you dress or what you look like they treat everyone who comes with respect and a positive attitude That goes a long way with a working person like myself who doesn't try too hard to impress and often gets judged for not 'dressing the part' of success When I travel it is often with juicers boxes of veggies a multitude of dogs or even collectibles I really appreciate their fair treatment of each of us who stayed at this great location Really super management modelThe place was beautiful to be in and at clean and uplifting The colors textures even the sunlight coming through the sheers and room dividers brought a smile to our faces The grounds are well maintained the people who work at the front desk restaurants and even the maids are all polite and caring to each who need them I couldn't ask for a nicer stay and will be sure to return only next time with a bunch of friends in tow to enjoy the suites Thanks so much for taking care of us You ROCK Valley Ho.
$5 sat lunch deal on sat and happy hours are the best deals in town.
I go to this cookie cutter pseudo Chinese/Asian place purely because of the convenience I sometimes just don't have the time and need something quickly so I generally like the online order ability  But come on placing an order at 7 pm showing up and paying for it and not having it ready until 7:45  I mean WTF is that.
More of a tourist attraction  Food is better elsewhere for the cost.
Here is some of the best pizza in the Valley  It is done in a traditional Brooklyn thin crust with mixed cheese and some fine tomato sauce  The pizza was ready within ten minutes and we ate in about twenty minutesThe place is located on Indian School Road around 8th StreetIt is intimate and the decor is NYC related with a television in back  No soda on tap only cansThe specials are reasonable in priceThe quality shows.
Flemings must have the best service in this town We came in early for HH Kris bounded over with a huge welcoming smile to get us seated and comfortable on the spacious patio Next he introduced us to our waiter Doug Ray Even though it started to get busy he never forgot about us checking with us frequently to make sure all was going well What a gracious guy Then Prentice came to inquire if everything was AOK The food was awesome but one thingif you want onion rings on the burger you have to ask now Come on over You won't regret it.
Had to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently  After a lot of checking a round I ended up here  Glad I did Great work fair price & quick turn around.
I love Coco's even if it's stereotyically an "eatery for the elderly" They make great pancakes and the waiters are always very friendly It's way better than Denny's or Village Inn Coco's is also a regional chain so it's more exclusive.
Agritopia finally exists as an establishment to Yelp about I believe that Agritopia is one of the premiere developments in the state for everything you want in a neighborhood As I write this I hear birds chirping in the trees and can spot residents cycling through the streets enjoying the meticulously landscaped neighborhoodWhen I first ventured out to Gilbert nearly 4 years ago I drove by Agritopia and immediately thought "This is a neighborhood from Desperate Housewives" Turns out I was wrong Dead wrong I told myself that I could never live in a neighborhood that seemed like it was nothing more that a clean pristine facade However nearly a year ago I moved into the neighborhood and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made Here's why:Location: Direct access to the Loop 202 makes it easy to get anywhere in the Valley in about 30 minutes Also nearby is San Tan Village Mall The mall is growing and developing into a nice outdoor mall with mid-range to upscale shopsNeighborhood: The neighborhood is beautiful and very well planned out There are many styles of houses with differing floor plans There's a home that is the right size for anyone My parents have a single story with a basement that is perfect for entertaining while my wife and I have a small two-story cottage that is the perfect starter home for us Agritopia boasts the smallest two-way streets in the Valley to help promote pedestrian walkways and reduce the heat island effect within the neighborhood Given the narrow streets all homes are equipped with emergency sprinkler systems reducing homeowner's insurance There is also a nice community center that is optimal for hosting small events (my wife and I had a wedding shower there and the community has neighborhood events throughout the year) Not to mention the fitness room with workout equipment and a nice pool that is even heated in the winter months The beautiful homes have front doors that face each other and promote social activity in front of the homes with neighbors This is the optimal way to get to know who lives near you and build lasting relationships which promotes a true sense of community Attractions: Keeping with the sense that this land was once a farm lives on for those in the neighborhood There is a community garden where residents can have their own plot of land to plant grow and harvest their own crops (Also promoting sustainability) There is also a commercial farm which supplies produce to the nearby Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market Joe's Farm Grill is the popular restaurant built from the Johnston's old home You may have seen them on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives This is a great lunch spot Also there is The Coffee Shop Located in an old tractor covering this coffee house has specialty espresso drinks and pastries Jessica Cuff owner was on Cupcake Wars and took home 1st place for her delicious treats The farm at Agritopia has a farm stand where the fresh local organic produce is available for purchase at extremely reasonable pricesKeep an eye out for this becoming THE PLACE to be in Arizona Plans for an assisted living development are in the works to break ground this spring/summer Also the commercial corner (named the EpiCenter) is in planning stages This will bring artisan products and establishments to the corner promoting local businesses walkability and gourmet food/drink.
The customer service here is wonderful The employees are always energetic and happy to help out even if it's 5 AM Of the two options for Starbucks this one is by far my favorite choice because of the quick service amiable employees and cool interior Most Starbucks stores have busy bodies as employees but this store's employees are attentive to the customers and are happy to help and converse with them as needed The drinks are fantastic and I have never had them make a mistake on my order they are wonderful I really like to go in and see one of their employees Allie because she is always bright-eyed and cheery and ready to help out anyone that walks into the store The full crew is energetic and I wouldn't suggest getting coffee from anywhere but this store.
My homme away from home  No attitudesGreat bartendersAwesome ownersGreat musicGay straight bi lesbianwhatever you areit's all here  I've never felt unwanted or uncomfortable here.
Just had my semi-annual splurge at Sprinkles As always the vanilla/vanilla was amazing and super moist Ventured out and tried the salted carmel WOW Super Yummy now off to the gym.
This place is kind of buried in a dead little strip mall opposite of Joe's Grotto and can be a little less than eye catching from the outside Once inside you can tell it's has been around for a while However I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here although they do have a lot of business on the take out side We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items The one we usually get includes Wonton soup the Poo Poo Platter (lol) Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by) Sizzling Shrimp House Special Chicken (best chicken ever) Mushu Pork and Peking Fried Rice And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious memorable and authentic Chinese meal.
I'm an investor in both residential and  commercial real estate  I've worked with Jason's team on a number of occasions and he's a top notch real estate professional  Jason identified several great deals for us and his knowledge of the local markets has been a huge asset on the leasing side of our business  I highly recommend Jason's services.
There is no greater fast food restaurant than Chick Fil A As a guy who's eaten at a lot of fast food restaurants over the years I can say this without question I used to eat their scrumptious chicken nuggets at their old location at Metrocenter mall when I was little and I have had a love for their food ever since If you love chicken as much as I do you will be hard-pressed to find a better recipe They know how to prepare chicken better than anyone The use of peanut oil to fry their chicken makes it healthier and much less greasy than their competitors Throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices incredible waffle fries a wide variety of condiments and homemade lemonade and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you'll ever get at a fast food establishment Whether you go for one of their sandwiches the nuggets or the breakfast items the chicken is without equal LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
Peoria Sports Complex is a great facility for spring training baseball  We went to this ball park on Friday March 4th to see the Reds and Mariners  The best seats in the house are in any section behind the home plate area  We scored two great seats in Section 206 Row 2 just to the right of home plate for only $38  The concession stands have your standard ball park fare  However there are a few independent concession stands where you can buy food items such as indian fry bread fried noodles and other goodies  You can even by an all you can drink cup ( 32oz ) for $9 and enjoy unlimited soda refills the entire gamePeoria Sports Complex does spring training right Its what spring training is all about and if you haven't watched a game here then you truly haven't watched spring training baseball  Parking was only $5I even got to shake Dusty Bakers ( Reds Manager ) hand after the game.
Rather than kitchy this place had pizzaz It has the updated 60's vib down pat Cocktails food and service all thumbs up.
If there was a NO star button I would have posted it I am not kidding when I say this place is a freaking nightmare I honestly felt like I was eating breakfast at the Drury Inn I soooo wanted to be excited about this place BUT I am extremely scared of this place First off it was Sunday and I was craving pumpkin pancakesSaw they had them on the menu via yelp Well no reg menu on Sunday's just brunch Ok fine $10 a person and you can get an omelet waffles (made to order cooking station) then the scary part There is a dining area set up with sliced deli meat potato salad (wtf) mini cupcakes and who cares what else I wanted to run for my life I ordered an omelet and all my veggies were raw in it Disgusting to say the least My waffles took forever cause they didn't spray the waffle iron so it stuck I don't have all night to write this review but I will not be returning for any circumstance.
Went here after a movie on a Saturday afternoon  Take your movie stub and you will get a free appetizer  I am not sure why we had not been here before  It is really nice inside and was packed  They bring you cornbread to start - were were not expecting that so had to re-evaluate what we were going to have  We had the trio appetizer which was huge so then we decided to split the steak burrito - they brought it out to us already split on separate plates - like that   Everything was delicious and we are now kicking ourselves as to why it has taken us 2 years to go here .
The worst costumer service I've ever had in my life I was interested in buying a treadmillso I tried running on itand got yelled at Also I got yelled at for punching a "punching" bag When I wanted to try some shorts on andI could NOT find one worker Not one of the workers smiled at me And when I finally found two workersthey were putting golf I WILL NOT EVER COME BACK AGAIN.
Black Garlic Compound Butteryou had me at hello  Learn at Lunch is an amazing opportunity to enjoy Beau MacMillian the person and the chef  Today's topic Arizona's Iron Chefs plus a Senior VP of Programming for the Food Network  Imagine three of the best restaurants and chefs creating their masterpieces in one meal then totally entertaining the audience  All of this paired with excellent wines and Q&A from the audience for $65 including tax and tip  Ohthey also had a DJ to play just the right music  This is an amazing event to share with someone who loves food  I would be a bit concerned taking a picky eater  "A Taste of of the Cooking Channel" menu (new channel goes layers deeper than food network must order from cable provider)Pasta Carbonara "Iron Chef Style" by Chef Lee Hillson TCooks / Mondavi Fume BlancOur table left nothing in their bowls from this course even the "steak-eater" dudesPrime Dry Aged Rib Eye Gratin Potatoes Smoked Bacon and Mushroom Hash by Chefs Beau MacMillan and William Patterson/ Mondavi MerlotThis steak had a Black Garlic Compound Butter-  Black Garlic new to me and delish  It is hard to make beef better but this was SOOOO much betterGrandma Polly's Tart Apple Pie by Chef Mark Tarbell/ Mondavi MuscatoI make a pretty good apple pie and only dream to reach this perfection  If you haven't had even a smell of Tarbell's rosemary carmelyou are missing outThis experience was memorable.
Ok  I have to admit first that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years  then I stopped into Freddy's one day and haven't gone to In N Out since  The service is great the food is AMAZINGLY good and the atmosphere is fun and fresh  You will not be disappointed  I do the California Double Combo  give them a try.
We eat out frequently and we have our usual fave haunts and places around Phoenix for dinner or weekend eats  We try different things a lot of it palatable most of it good and some of it great  But when you enjoy a meal that is truly superb in every sense of the word it sticks with you  Superb describes our recent experience at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale  Located inside the toney Saguaro Hotel (hipster haven and loved it) Distrito is a lone outpost holding down the fort in far flung Arizona leagues from its' Garces Group cousins back east  I was surprised to learn that Garces Group which apparently has a stronghold in the Philadelphia and Atlantic City food scenes has a few outliers here in the Southwest Distrito & Old Town Whiskey at The Saguaro in Scottsdale and Tonto & El Jefe in the swanky Saguaro Hotel in Palm Springs  Personally I'm a big fan of indie & local but I also think there's  a place for regional chainlets to show their colors  Garces Croup's Distrito does just thatOur meal at Distrito was my freshman introduction to the Gacrces Group and man it made a great first impression on me  The menu is chock full of small plates and sharing options (as well as as full meals) so we took a snacky approach to dinner  My other half and I wanted to sample a variety of items from the menu and agreed we'd get more bang for our buck by going micro rather than limiting ourselves to just an app and a main course  I'm glad we didWe started off with the guacamole a tell-tale bell weather of how the rest of the meal might go at any restaurant and we were more than delighted with the fresh hand-hacked guac dusted with fresh cotija cheese and delicious chips  We decided to splurge a bit and added the fresh crab (only $5) and didn't regret it for one second The crab was so fresh I'd swear we were dining on the beach in the Chesapeake Bay (except we'd never get avocados that fresh in MD) so we were thrilled with the bi-coastal comboMoving onto the "Snacks" or Antojitos section we split an order of Rellenitos  A clever twist on the classic "Chile Relleno" this bad boy was served sliced  each piece breaded and fried to perfection with the tastiest smoked tomato sofrito I've ever had the pleasure of spooning past my lips  150% scrumptiousMy other half scarfed Pescado Tacos after the server told him the fish of the day (the species escapes me now) that constituted the fish tacos  Divine  We then each split Small Plates of Queso Fundido (with a savory Duck Barbacoa) and Chilpachole de Mariscos a spicy seafood stew  My boif loved the Queso (I'm not a huge fan of duck but it was very tasty) and I laid quick waste to the bowl of Chilpacholewhich was chock full of fresh mussels clams and hand-made masa dumplings  The stew sauce alone is incomparable and I've been craving a return visit since we ate there even if just for this dish aloneRounding out the extraordinary (and I do not use that word lightly  This meal was EXTRA-ordinary) I give big props to the staff and service of Distrito Scottsdale  Our server was adorable knowledgeable friendly and quick as a flash with food drink refills and answering questions for us  The General Manager Niels even stopped by our table to chat with us check on everything and make sure we were enjoying ourselves  That is rare in this day and age and I appreciate the personalized attention brief and non-intrusive conversation and approachability  I told him we'd be back and I stay true to my promisesApparently Distrito has a revamped menu and is remodeling inside  If there were one thing I would take points off for it would and could only be the décor -- in that I was facing a blank wall during dinner Considering that my attention was fully focused on the fantastic food savory servings and the company of my adorable other half I barely even noticed the wallsI'd like to go back to Distrito soon (even if just for that Chilpachole seasfood stew) and pace myself so I could try their Platos Fuertes (Large Plates) and dessert menu We never even made it that far because we were STUFFED on apps and small plates For 2 big boys to not reach dessert phase you know the portions are generous and the servings substantial  I'd also like to get a group together some time and give their Taco Bar a try  It's $25 per person (min 2 peeps) and features an assortment of tasty Latino fare that I'm sure would knock my socks off -- if it's anything like the meal we experienced 2 weeks ago at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale inside The Saguaro Hotel  Definitely A++ Distrito.
The White Chocolate Grill is a great place to meet friends for a dinner and a drink   I love the decor of the restaurant  The menu is unique and the food is unbelievable  ( It can get a little loud when it's busy ).
how can you NOT love Costco  I mean you can get almost anything (ok ok yeah sometimes you have to get A LOT of it) at very good pricingThe food court is an excellent deal for a bite to eat  The quality of products and the return policy are great as well.
WOW  Great owner terrific ambiance a range of unique items with a broad price range  Check it out.
I've lived in these apartments since mid to late 2010 and will be moving soon into a house which I am very excited about Trillium could be a much better place to live but it is not When I first toured the complex it was a Saturday afternoon - the college kids were either drunken from their hangovers or working on picking up the next skank at the local bars If you REALLY want to see this place in its true color then you need to tour it at night after hoursThe proximity is close to ASU The idiots are loud and obnoxious The walls and windows are just not insulated enough to keep out their yelling loud cars and motorcycles The only salvation is if you live on the 3rd floor and get lucky enough to have quiet individuals next to you and below youParking needs its own paragraph You will not be able to find a place to park if you own more than one car You will be assigned one parking place I've had college kids try to park in my parking place also Forget finding another place to park though They invite all 50 of their friends over for the weekend Parking is simply out of the question here So if you take the bus or don't own a car this is the perfect place for youThe grounds are reasonably maintained Lately they've been doing less with the landscape and there's dog ---- just about everywhere you walk Lighting is ok - could be better as it seems very dim when walking through the corridor to your apartment at nightThe apartments themselves are fairly spacious but beware the cheapness Cheap fixtures everywhere Plastic countertops pressed wood cabinets poor insulation stained carpets and shoddy pipingThe maintenance people are nice but they do not know what they are doing If it's easy they can fix it with no problem If it's more complicated it requires several visits My washer didn't drain the water during the drain cycle for nearly three months I told them the washer needed to be replaced They danced around the issue during this time until I wrote a very demanding letter that was extremely firm All the while I was spending more in utility costs because my clothes had to be dried for hoursThe staff have absolutely no clue what they are doing I always place rent checks two of them in an envelope with the statement and then seal it and deliver it personally to the person at the front desk They lost one check but not the other I took the issue all the way up to the corporate office when they threatened to terminate my lease and made it seem like we had been the ones at fault for their mishandling of checks Their corporate office explained there were several people handling the checks during the long journey back to the corporate office to be cashed It IS NOT the tenant's fault if checks are lost or stolen by the office personnel**An update to the above paragraph - after fighting with the office about the check and writing them another check (never do this especially if you have a carbon copy) they agreed to at least pay the stop payment on the check -$35 The corporate office explained this would be an "instant" credit So I went in during my next month's rent payment and the front office said it would be on my next bil Not very instant but I waited patiently for the next month The next month came and still no credit I finally had to call the corporate office again and complain Not one thing was done to compensate me for wasting my time and causing problems The office crew and the business team at Trillium are absolutely INCOMPETENT Lease agreements are the worst They will charge you $1660 to terminate your lease instantly PLUS the incentives you have received For example they "say" the apartment I live in is really $1155 a month but they are giving me a "discount" and I only pay $932 a month If you terminate you must pay the $1660 fee plus the difference of the discounted rate and the regular rate for all of the time you've been there That's some pretty shady business practicesYou would be a great fit for this place if you are under the age of 25 act immaturely like to get loud and drunk don't have a car or take the bus don't mind the noise don't care about cheap crap in your apartment enjoy the hassle of the maintenance crews and incompetent office personnel and just really generally don't careMy advice: DO NOT waste your money here These apartments are already expensive and you certainly do not get what you pay for.
Abe just open another location on North 7th Street  Really honest and considerate man  Have you every went to a auto mechanic place and he has candles and a spread of food out  Car wash oil change and etc.
A very affordable place to go to get Fresh Asian food  Better than most Asian buffets  Definitely one of the best Asian places The taste of the food is right on The mark  Close to the Wigwam Resort  Great west side Asian Bistro- fresh ingredients (try the hot and sour soup).
Mr Flores was very helpful and knowledgeable  I need also found him to be very honest  His price was lower than everybody else for a Trane 14 SEER unit  I would definitely recommend him.
East coaster who misses White Castle in total heaven This place is great Definitely worth a trip I had the cheeseburger sliders minus the mustard SO great.
Not impressed Front desk competency is inconsistent At busy times the staff is visibly overwhelmed I've had to go back twice because of their mistakes Too bad Sonora has a monopoly Competition would be a good thing for them and the consumer The customer should not have to observe or hear their comments when assignment overload occurs The billing procedures are strange They send out separate bills for each test They have yet to figure out how to put all the charges on one sheet Just when you think you've paid all the charges more are mailed out separately A negative rating would fit Sonora just nicely.
The Keg was the best dining experience my date and I have had in a very long time We had been here a few times before but the service was out of this world this time I had the Alaskan crab legs with garlic mashed potatoes and my date the New York strip and twice baked potato His was cooked exactly how he likes and my crab legs were perfection Our server Tyler was knowledgable about wine suggestions and was a pleasure to chat with Ashley the manager was great as well and seemed to genuinely care about our experience We will be back many times in the future.
Michelle was the worst server If you don't like your job and have a bad attitude find a new career  We ordered drinks (2 of us)  it took 15 mins  We ordered 2 appetizers and asked to keep the menu as it was our 1st time there and would like to order more One app was a crab crunch roll the other was an order of lettuce wraps Crab crunch had a hair in the side of ginger Lettuce wraps were alright We never saw our server we had to get our own chop sticks and soy sauce  We waited 25 minutes for the apps Our drinks were gone by the time the apps came WE NEVER SAW OUR SERVER  She knew we wanted to order more as we explained  When she finally came back we asked for the check and she was so rude We explained how we had a hair on our plate drinks were empty we wished to order more and we haven't seen you in 30 min  She was the worst server we have ever had Will not be back I will also tell everyone I know not to go there We even asked the bartender to get our server Which he did and she yelled at him We are shocked at the service Whoever hired this girl needs to rethink.
Fourth trip here  VERY impressed w/their knowledge   They have been fixing my daughter attempt to home bleach her dark brown hair to platinum blonde   I was so impressed w/how they handled that situation  I got my hair done here my boyfriend got his hair cut here and now my daughter's hair is finally ready to be set back to brown  While here I watched them fix other hair color boo-boo's from other salons  They know what they are doing and aren't looking to do something to damage your hair just to make the rentthat means a lot to me  The do keep the place on the cold side so dress accordingly  )  Prices are reasonable     Adult cut $15 Cut/style $25 kids cut$10 Color $40& up perms $40 and up and they do waxing.
I had several roof leaks so after reading the review on the Yelp I gave them a call  They were very professional and owner came out to give me a free estimate  He showed me several photos and explained everything that needs to be done which came out to $230000  He sent me an written comprehensive estimate via e-mail the same day  Because it was so much money I wanted to get more estimates  I called 2 other companies from "to fix it"  1 company came out and gave me an estimate for $200000 more than VIP for less work and another company came out but never sent me an estimate  I called VIP and set up a time for them to come out and do the work  They were prompt and finished the work with in 2 days  I was very satisfied with this company.
Great Middle Eastern food  I used to eat there with some friends from Turkey and they all agreed that this was one of the best places in the ValleyI am huge fan of Kafta and theirs is one of the best I have had  The portions are huge and everything from the meat to the rice to the sauces are great  The lentil soup is also a nice touch.
Need a boba tea house in north Phoenix or Scottsdale Always quick service and tasty cold drinks I always get the strawberry slush perfect for the Phoenix summer days.
For a white/hispanic/german dude this place was OFF THE HOOK GOOD It matched all my taste buds needs The jewish sliders are so tasty with the fries and gravy Our server David was really great and funny and kept our drinks full The cookies at the counter kept the kids enthralled and the prices great food and great service kept me more than thrilled.
I came here last night with m'lady and two of our closest 'foodie' friends and I must say we were very impressed with Little Cleo's The new gem of the Sam Fox empire lived up to my expectations and then some in terms of ambiance service and quality of foodWalking in the restaurant is smallish with seating at tables and bar stools The first thing I noticed are the oysters - boom - right in front of you on display and labeled from location After settling in you start to get a 'San Francisco' type vibe in the atmosphere with the 40's music white tiles open kitchen etc (dare I say it - I know Bay Area natives will probably turn up their noses at that as they do for every thing else)You absolutely cannot come here without getting the oysters don't even think about it Second do you like crab Well they have a "Warm jar of King Crab and butter with grilled bread" - verbatim that is what it says on the menu I want to die eating a warm jar of king crab and butter that is how good it was Lastly you have to get the frog legs Don't be a wuss sack up and eat them They are delicious super tender and have an incredible Thai chili sauce We ate everything family style I recommend you do the sameTop all of it off with great service from our server Casey and you have a fantastic seafood dining experience in Phoenix Oh and don't forget to buy the kitchen a beer for $2 before you leave.
Brigetts is a great neighborhood bar It has a lot of variety Excellent Happy Hour along with some type of entertainment  Trivia Karaoke and even comedy once a week It's good bar food along with breakfast served all day Bar staff and servers were fine and would chat with you if they weren't busy Not many places can you get a HH draw of beer for a Buck.
I recently got relocate to Phoenix from las vegas at first I was so depressed because there is no 24hr pho restaurants like there is in las Vegas and to me eating pho and going to walmart at 3am is my favorite thing to doI came to this restaurant today because all the good reviews after work and let me tell youit was the best bowl of pho I ever had I got the fried rice with chicken and pork and a no 1 large and my friend got s regular no 1 and the bill was only $1850 wow what a good price and I told myself I want to eat here everyday lol.
Great service perfect job reasonable price Definitely recommended Metro Carpet Care came by on time & called when they were 15 minutes away Very professional & experienced in carpet care.
This was my first trip here after having look around for good southern food I'm a fried catfish fanatic and I came especially to try it out and it was some of the best I've eaten I got the 3 piece catfish with 4 shrimp meal with fried okra I opted for the spicy version and it was just the right amount of spice Not too hot but just enough to taste  Lightly battered with cornmeal and amazingly good The shrimp were good but nothing compared to the fish and okra  Now for the okraOMGlightly battered with great mix of seasoning made this some of the best I've had Portions are largeI had one piece of fish leftover There is also a lot of BBQ dishes and countless other options and sides The guy who took our order which I'm assuming would have been the owner was super friendly and very enthusiastic about food Very reasonable prices with a casual atmosphere A great little find and I will definitely visit here many times in the future.
I've known Misty for two decades (does that show my age) and she is the only person who is allowed to touch my hair besides myself I'm always wanting new looks and custom dye jobs and she is never hesitant to follow alongLast week I decided I wanted purple throughout the underneath of my hair and my usual blonde weave on top It's a complicated process and time consuming but she's a pro and can mulit-task The best thing about her talent is she won't finish until your hair is perfect And she's not afraid to tell you like it is She won't let you walk out of the salon with some celebrity hairstyle that does not fit your features and would just look ridiculousMisty is caring thoughtful and listens She gives great advice on how to maintain a style and give proper hair care The products she carries are top of the lineI take my fickle teenage daughter to Misty as well She changes her mind about her hair just as much as I do Misty lets my daugter know what is realistic and what is just poor teenage fads But no matter what my daughter is pleased and her friends are always wanting the same thing Last week Misty did a vibrant red and it was stunnyHer prices are reasonable and you receive that high level of customer satisfaction The salon is inside Signature Studios and Misty is always offering snacks and beverages for her clients She takes care of you.
This review isn't based on anything more than the donuts Simply put they are the best in Phoenix No major complaints on the coffee or other food items either But the donutsoh the donuts.
I LOOOOOOOOOVE GREEN I don't love their parking Beware Carpool if you can DON'T PARK AT COCO'S They sometimes tow That being said their food is DELICIOUS Proof that vegetarian and vegan doesn't mean tasteless Definitely get the fries they're seasoned and pretty much perfect You get a decent serving of them as well Brunch is served on Sundays I've never been disappointed The Biscuits'n'gravy is quite tasty.
If you enjoy (and really who doesn't) amazing and fresh produce wild caught meats etc then definitely check out the Old Town Farmer's Market every Saturday from 8am to 1pm We've been a few times already and need to get a 2nd produce only fridge in the near future as we come home with way to much each time McClendon's Farm is the main produce provider at the Old Town Farmer's Market and some of the best produce I have seenIf you go make sure to bring your reusable environmental friendly bags to put all your produce into If you forget they have plastic bags Really fun walking around to meet the other local vendors try out their delicious foods and get outdoors in downtown Scottsdale.
I'm definitely a fan  The gelato is rich and smooth the staff was really cool about giving out samples and since I was there on a Saturday night the people watching was prime -- lots of cougars and adam lambert look alikes  I got the chocolate caramel and the strawberry combined it was truly sublime  I shall return to the Gelato Spot.
Gelato is perfect - all the time Staff is incredibly friendly and remembers you (not sure if that's good or bad) Owned by some awesome people One time my husband brought home a flavor I didn't care for and when I sent feedback online the OWNER replied to me within an hour on a Saturday night and told me he agreed with me and they would retire the flavor immediately I cannot say enough good things and I will go to the Gelato Spot as long as I live in AZ nothing else compares.
If you don't want to read through my drama just beware to DOUBLE CHECK your order if you come here  The food is fine - like any other MacDonald's - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong  for me anyway and no I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom orderI am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don't seem to care  On several occasions this particular Micky D's has gotten my order wrong  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time  two times  three times About a month ago I'd already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong  I didn't have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation "Come by next time and I'll still let you get your order for free  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok"  I was like "Whoa that was awfully generous" and thanked herA couple of weeks later I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite  This Micky D's is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner  "They forgot my McNuggets"  Well this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting downI drove back to the Micky D's with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets  She was apologetic saying her minimal obligatory apology and sent me on my way  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong  There's no excuse  Don't even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior  Come on now at the managerial level communication with customers is pretty vital I would thinkI left flabbergasted that my money wasn't refunded - not even that it wasn't refunded but it wasn't even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected  No point in getting steaming mad  "You got your nuggets so just let it go" I told myself  The next day I decided to get our "free breakfast" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone  When I dropped Corrinda's name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order she asked for a receipt I said I didn't have one and she was going to ask the manager what to do  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn't give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved  Again I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to meThe restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald's  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I've lost count  The manager's don't seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don't seem to know how to handle customer issues.
I've done business with other places in the past but never again These guys here are honest and fair We're having several things done right now and it brings a comforting feeling to feel I am dealing with honest people I will update with details when we get the car back.
Just a good burger and fries place.
Such a wonderful place My husband and I spent our wedding night here and it was just a beautiful place We went to breakfast the next morning were there was a really good buffet We will be back soon.
After a long weekend at a kung fu seminar my sifu had and REALLY bad food a had in scottsdale I was thinking to myself AZ food sucks I don't live in AZ but I go there atleast once a year and when I leave I am disapointed and wishing I'm back in CA for real food One of my friends that live there challenged my complaint and brought me to Famous Dave's Barbeque You know i loves me some bbq but this is AZ how good can it be WoW This place is off the hook we ordered the dinner sampler which had chicken hot links BRISKET ribs and some sides They were all feakin OFF DA HOOK man Especially the brisket i think it was the best i ever had they offered 4-5 different kinds of bbq sauce I'm tellin ya i was in heaven PLS forgive me AZ for i have sinned you have opened my eyes and i will never say the food sucks there again THANK YOU SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER  :).
AHHHH - I LOVE THIS PLACEWhenever someone goes to Phoenix I always tell them to hit up Culinary DropoutFood - Best Prime Rib Dip Sandwich in the US  Love it can't order anything elseDrinks - Marg on the rocks with a shot of Guinness Beer  Can't even thinking about having margs any other way any more.
With several Orthodontics offices in the valley we found it difficult to quickly decide who to use for our daughter's braces After meeting with several Doctors to discuss braces  we chose Dr Serrano & Kyger We are extremely pleased with our experience  Save your time and take it from someone who did the research- this is where you want to be.
Amazing food quality I am not eating grains or dairy for a little bit so you'd think I would have suffered here lol but on the contrary I found there was plenty of choices for me to choose from and what I ordered turned out to be DELICIOUS To start I had a side of Veggies which were Balsamic Braised Carrots & Broccolini They were cooked and seasoned perfectly The carrots were my favorite I would have eaten a few more orders of those had I been wearing elastic waist pants I made a mental note ) My main course was a TLC Salad It was composed of arugula spring greens beets pears smoked almonds & fennel with a citrus shallot vinaigrette I had them hold the pecorino & add chicken This was one of the most scrumptious salads I've ever had With every bite there was a different burst of yumminess The beets (of which I'm a big fan of now) and pear really made this salad The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not the least bit dry which I'm always afraid of I am glad that I added the extra protein because the salad size is not large so I would have been starvin marvin within an hour without it The service was excellent There's lots of parking in the back Both booths and tables are available and there was an outdoor seating area that faces Central There's also a drive through which is really uncommon for a non fast-food place lol & from what I hear you can order kegs to go ask more about that if you're interested because I didn't probe for details I was too busy imagining someone receiving a keg through a car window :D.
Excellent Affordable and very friendlyI brought in a two piece suit I needed to have the coat brought in and the pants tapered as well I brought them in a Tuesday evening I needed the suit for the next night for my wife and I's anniversary dinner I knew it would be along shot but I asked if it could be done They did I'am so grateful for that and will never forget.
This is one of the best coffee spots ever  The people are incredible and the food rocks  I am there at least once a week It is an fabulous place to meet with your friends.
It's unfortunate that I have to write a bad review- but I believe it's important to get this out there This is especially for those that are non-locals Thursday night my friend and I needed a ride back to our hotel It was already late and we could not take the light rail back because it had already made its last roundStrike 1: Driver did not know where he was going & he was on his cell phone asking for directionsStrike 2: I knew that he knew a more direct way to get to our hotel instead he chose to take a scenic route through a residential area Therefore making the drive longer than it should have been Strike 3: THE METER WAS NOT RUNNING So he basically just said a random price when we got to our hotelWe were picked up in the US AIRWAYS CENTER and our hotel was on Central & Osborn We paid $12 for the fare I guess I should assume that is a decent price However the service was unacceptable from my perspective The meter should have been onPS they also DBA as Elite Taxi Cab.
Wow the carne asada burrito I had was great It was also a plus that they had Mexicoke The place was very clean and the customer service was great I will be back.
Quick.
Best airport food in the country I'm a cowboy/rancher and I approve of this beef Not allowed to have steak knives in the airport sooo They drop really tender beef on your plate And they cook It to perfection And in picky when it comes to how my meat is cooked So to speak Get the testosterone saladEat beef.
I have purchased many sets of tires over the years from Discount Tire Three sets total from this location I searched for prices on-line and called all the local tire sellers to find the best price I found a couple on-line companies that I could get them cheaper for but mostly just the difference in tax I opted (again) to use a local retailer for tires They are local and I do not have to transport tires to the shopand the tires I wanted were on sale Once I decided where to buy my tires I was able to check online for store stock I called the store and spoke to Ryan who informed me those tires were on sale Being strapped for time I asked what times were available for an appointment He said he could put me in the queue now and I would be up in about 15 I arrived in 10 paid for the tires and they had it in the bay before I put my credit card back in my wallet 30 min later and I was off with 4 new tires I will be back.
OkMy experiences at Sam Fox restaurants have covered the spectrum but today North really delivered   The dishes and the execution were 100% on point  I started with the seasonal vegetable salad Beets Carrots Radishes Kale Romaine Dried Fruit Farro Marcona Almonds Pecorino and White Balsamic Dressing  One of the best salads I have had in a long timegreat flavor and texture combinationsand perfectly dressed  The Burger and The Spaghetti and Meatballs were also home runs  I would dare say Best Spaghetti in town  High quality thick pasta prepared perfectly al dente with a little chewiness and a lusciously rich perfectly balanced tomato sauce with herbs and parmesan  It was phenomenal   The burger was also fantasticgreat bun and flavorful toppings  The crispy potatoes  are wonderfully preparedget them  I would like to thank whomever created and executed these dishes in the kitchen at North for a lunch that surpassed my expectations.
I love everything about crescent ballroom and I wish every band in phoenix came through here Seriously Everything is great Perfect Awesome I love crescent.
Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar  Located in a cozy vintage home this is my new favorite bar  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin I tend to be one of those)  Best of all Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air  Seriously Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers in a non ventilated home  Jesus God how do you people stand it  Smoking is gross The Roosevelt is cool.
Here is a rare but deserving compliment for an establishmentFIVE STARSthat's right this establishment at the Scottsdale Quarters is top notch I decided to go there and have lunch todayand I have to tell you it was fantastic I had the Turkey Burgerwhich may be the best I have ever hadwas fired grilled with lettucetomatoprovolone cheeseavocadoon a Flax seed Bun I had a Kale salad and sweet potato hash as my side dishesno French Fries peoplenot that kind of restaurantLOL(sorry) Now True Food simply means they use locally organic and locally grown productseverything is light but doesn't lack any flavorand trust me it DOESN'Teverything taste great The have tons of gluten-free items on the menuand the honey lemonade I had was simply delicious and refreshing You get one free refill on that and unlimited refills on Black and Green Teaif your a Tea fan If you decide to visit this locale ask for Brockhe was outstandingand I made sure his manger who's name is Kelli (hope I am not spelling it wrong) knew that he did a great job My water glass never got emptyhe refilled my lemonade without me even askingand he checked on us frequently to make sure we didn't want for anythingneedless to say he got a nice tip I could go on and onbut just go for yourself and remember to Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.

Pho-yuck this place I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease The bun was about the same It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glassThe service was horrible and I will not be back.
I had always loved In n Out in fact when I lived in Reno years ago before they had In n Out my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out But since moving to Phoenix I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome They take a little time to get your order ready BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT In n Out also takes pretty much that long I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meatI would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent they have mushrooms A-1 and BACON and the beef just tastes better IMHO The grease is what makes it great If you don't want a burger with grease go buy a Boca burger and choke on it seriously because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking aboutTheir fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato Which is few and far between TBH So next time you are in the mood for a burger THIS is the spot it's hearty filling perfect amount of a juicy mouthwatering foodgasm :-).
RDT I love this place I have been training here a little over a year and I'm still learning new things The classes are fun and a great workout but but the redman classes are my favorite If you are looking for a real self defense class and don't mind some good exercise at the same time this is the place for you.
I'm not a big "organic" kind of guy  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I canHaving said that I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst  Service is family oriented too  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die forAs a die-hard burger man this is my default stop  It is close to the house in a pleasant shopping center and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me  This place is that good.
I really wanted to love this because I am a downtown resident who loves to eat out but I'm sad to say I won't go here again for dining  I left feeling that I had just spent $15 on a small bowl of spaghetti-o's and the packaged stale breadsticks also left a lot to be desiredI hope the powers-that-be at PastaBAR will note the negative reviews and re-work the menu because the location and decor are amazing.
Started using Arizona Business Forms at work in February 2011 heard about them through our Company President's Executive Assistant I worked with Gary Williams to create cards for our Business Reply Mail account Superb customer service he was beyond helpful in working with the bureaucracy that is the US Postal Service All with a smile on his face A positive attitude goes a long way and clearly Gary recognizes thisEvery order has been completed in a timely manner and sometimes I'll receive a shipment well before the date promised Best of all the price is right As long as this keeps up we'll continue using ABF Actually about to call them now for some graphic design assistance for a logo I'm working on ABF is an exceptional company and I never hesitate to recommend them to anyone asking about commercial printing and design.
I'm pissedI went here on a Thursday night at 9pm looking for dinnerI was so psyched after reading reviewsAnd BOOOThey stop serving food at 9pmSighSo yeah I'm pissed at them  I work late most nights and do end up eating out around 9pmWhy  WHYBooo.
While visiting friends in Scottsdale (from Seattle where we are spoiled with good Thai food) we got a craving and our friends suggested Thai House Everything was so good I had the lunch special with panang curry Could have been a little spicier (though I did only order 2 star) but otherwise it was perfect Will be sure to come back here on my next trip to Phoenix.
I was invited to my cousins wedding at this lovely location The resort itself is absolutely stunning The grounds are very well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpfulThe wedding was held on the golf course and made for an amazing view of the mountains and sunset (which was perfect for this 530 wedding) The area where the reception took place was right below the main restaurant/bar for the resort the area provided was small but perfect for the amount of people attending (they may have a separate location for bigger parties) there was plenty of room on the dance floor for us to all get-down and boogie The resort also catered the food and I must say I was very impressed AS the guests of the party entered the reception area we were greeted with smiles by two young ladies serving finger foods as appetizers There was a try of baby bruschetta and crape wrapped asparagus sprinkled with asiago cheese Both were very good but I must say to the restaurant manager if this asparagus isn't on your normal menu it should be and ASAP They were Delicious and everyone really enjoyed them For dinner we had the option of a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus or salmon that came with a side of rice pilaf and asparagus I was lucky enough to try both options and personally i would always pick salmon of steak but this time around I enjoyed the steak much more My steak was cooked just perfectly but i did hear other guests say there's was a little rare for their liking (I didn't mind it at all) although I didn't have took much connection with much of the staff the ones that were working this party we all extremely nice and helpful all in all i would defiantly recommend this location to throw and large corporate event or wedding I'm sure you will be taken care of.
So I went back for a 3rd time already  This place absolutely rocks  I could eat here and order something new everytime and leave happy every time  (except the wings see earlier review)Today my buddy Cory and I went for lunch and ate the Creole Q pie which was on their new insert  It was SOOOOOOOO yummy  It had Creole BBQ shrimp with tabasco cheese and a butter garlic sauce  They even give u extra sauce to drizzle over the top for more flavor  I know for pizza traditionalists these pies may not be the type you are looking for but for more adventurous on their pies they have many great options  Thanks again for another great lunch Mellow Mushroom.
Best black bean burger I ever had and the fried pickles were very interesting.
4 wordsdon't waste your time The menu limited Food not flavorful Workers ungrateful.
Thank you yelpers  I was looking for great Mexican food and you guys and gals were great  We came here Friday after a game and I was impressedTo begin it is not a sit down restaraunt  You place your order at the counter then find a table  I ordered the carne asada tacos and they were awesome  They had onions and cilantro  The slasa was great  These little tacos were a great way to end the day  Now if they sold tequila it would be perfect  But I do recomend it for those who want delicious tacos.
We go here for lunch every time we visit my Mom in Arizona  We always get the same thing because we love it so much  The Asparagus Soup to start and also a Cesar salad  Then we get the 4 cheese pizza and my mom makes her own combo pizza  It is so good  It is Italian pizza if you like that style  It is just hard to find it made like this anywhere  Can't say much about anything else there but if you go this route you will be very happy.
Out on errands today I happened onto Tortas Paquime here  I was actually on my way to Best Wok Chinese Buffet over at 51st Av & McDowell but knowing how good this place is how could I help but stop     :-)So I ordered a cup of Tortilla Soup which actually brought a BOWL of it (Surprise #1) right away from the friendly counter gal and OMG it was such a treat  super tasty and topped with slices of avocado and lines of sour cream  YumThen it was over to the nice Salsa Bar to try a variety of different peppers carrots onion strings and some Salsa Verde to add to what they put on my TortaRight about then friendly Señor Chef arrived at my comfortable booth with my hot Torta Paquime AND SURPRISE #2 a side of excellent homemade potato chipsSo I added a little Salsa & bit into my Torta  YUMThis particular Torta starts with a fluffy fresh Mexican bun filled with lean pork sirloin slices of avocado & tomato This awesome place is SO FIVE STARS & easily holds its own against any fast casual restaurant in the Valley including the excellent Los Reyes de la Torta  Their other two locations are excellent too & on top of that look at the LOW prices     :-))"Cup" of Tortilla Soup:  $199Torta Paquime:  $499.
Money doesn't grow on trees but Dollar tree grows on savingAlthough one may be embarrassed to go into a discount store you'll miss out on some very cool items or only a dollar  Things that you would normally buy at Walmart or Target you can get it here for a fraction of the price  In this economy quality dollar items are hard to find but at least here you'll find something that may surprise you and stretch out your budget  Staff are friendly and place is clean Also the company seems to do a lot of community projects as well which is pleasantly surprising for a discount store.
At Skin of Dreams you'll have an amazing spa experience  It's lovely soothing and inviting Paula keeps my skin looking fabulous and I enjoy every minute of my visits with her  I've had microderms and light chemical peels and my results are fantastic Paula is wonderful - she offers great skin care treatments great skin care advice and great skin care products  Skin of Dreams has exceeded my expectations in every way and I highly recommend this spa if you're looking for professional personalized skin care  Thanks Paula for always adding your extra touches to make sure I'm comfortable and relaxed and for helping me to look and feel my best.
I went in scared of dental work after hiding from it for many years  The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and not painful at all  Great nice gentle people  I had Dr Larson.
Great foodI recommend the waffles with bacon and hash brownsamazing strawberry lemonade Went on a saturday early afternoon and only had maybe a 5 minute waitdef going again.
Hungry Monk is the newest addition to my "I wish it were in the city" list This place features craft beers on draft and it's not like that range of places that offer whatever keg is going to sell the best because they want the money This guy stocks beers that are actually interesting hard to find and really worth the trip I had a Lost Abbey Judgement Day and my girlfriend had the Dead Bastard which is basically just an Arrogant Bastard and a Rogue Dead Guy mix not a complitation between the two breweries I found this a bit odd but whatever I didn't have any food but this place definitely gets it when it comes to beers.
Had the most memorable experience here Everyone was so nice and talkative My tech Sarah was very outgoing and did a fantastic job on my mani/pedi I will definitely come back again when I am in the area.
One of my favorite places to go for flavorful seafood and fabulous service Won't break the bank Remember that Sundays are "Any of the specials of the week" for $10 You've GOT to try it for that price Go local.
I have been a customer of Molly Maids for years  Why1 - crew is always on time2 - flexibility - if I need to change my day/slot I can do so without fail3 - nothing has ever been stolen (lol)4 - the house SPARKLES5 - reliability and consistencyI have used 4 other cleaning services since moving here 9 years ago  Invariably all the others eventually slacked off in quality which is why they got the bootNot with Molly Maids however  Also the franchise owner Kurt is very approachable and a real gem  I had to suspend service for a few months and he was kind enough to keep my prime slot for me  And kept my rate the same when I returned  Not many business owners would be that accommodating.
Huge store Probably the biggest Sports Authority i've ever been too Love the selection for the women's clothing and all of the shoes The lines can be long though and the store itself is kind of hidden by trees which is a shame Employees were nice and the sale rack was a good size Dressing room area could be a little bit bigger though.
Don't you just like people that are happy about what they're doing  It's probably because they eat there  If you find your self shopping at the Rack in Chandler this is an excellent meal stop  Order the delicious standards of Pad Thai Pineapple Fried Rice and Satay medium to slightly hot you'll still taste all the wonderful food and that winter cold will just wanna leave :)  Live long and prosper Thai Cafe.
One of the best sub shops hands down Love the way they steam the subs make them taste freaking deliciousReally there isn't any sub on the menu you can't go wrong with Average prices and the "Welcome to Firehouse" never gets oldGive it a go and head to Firehouse.
Didn't even get a chance to try their cookies or ice cream because of the horrendous smell that permeated throughout the store  My friend and I ate lunch at Crave across the street and decided to stop by Cookiez to get dessert  As soon as we opened the door the smell slapped us in the face  I felt we had entered a bathroom which hadn't been cleaned in months  My friend said it smelled like an old gym locker room  Needless to say we left without ordering.
$6 for a day pass and it's a beautiful park I have yet to try the longer and more difficult  trails but there are plenty to chose fromI still definitely recommend the waterfall path It's short and sweet and you get to play in some of the cooler water at the end of the path What a refreshing break from the heat.
I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food Well there was this one time but it was because it was sold out I'm okay with that it tells me it was really popular that night AnywayThe prices are good the teas are good and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand islandYou know what look at the average review score I really think that's the most telling part of this place Really Go Eat Enjoy.
We went and have a wonderful dinner  We liked everything about the restaurant  Upon arrival there was a line up but fortunately I called ahead and we were immediately seated -:) - The appetizer Lobster Spinach Queso was amazing  The waiter was really patient with us he brought us a few tasters until we found what we liked then we ordered our bottle and the salads great too    The steaks WOW each one of the 3 of us had it cooked to perfection  If I was to say anything upon entry it was loudthe music a touch too much so but when we were seated in the pit the ceiling was so high the sound was not overwhelming at all My husband is a pretty picky steak eater and he'd definetely go back   Joyce H.
I've been taking my dog to Banfield since she was a puppy and usually have sub-par service This time however I was even more disturbed by my visit I had to wait almost 20 minutes until someone came into the room to see my dog and I The vet tech was friendly but the veterinarian was a different story She kept badgering me about getting a wellness plan and hinted that the plan included dental care When she looked at my dog she then proceeded to make comments about my dog's teeth and plaque build-up Clearly a scheme The most disturbing part about the visit was when my dog wouldn't eat the dog biscuit the vet tried to give her When she wouldn't eat it the vet proceeded to grab a can of Cheese Whiz (CHEESE WHIZ) off the counter and give my dog a big glob of it a) The vet did not even ask me if this was okay Would you go up to someone's infant child and give it candy without asking the mother first Probably notb) I find it incredibly ironic that we're in a pet store surrounded by thousands of different kinds of dog treats but the vet gives my dog processed human "food" I don't even eat cheese whiz let alone feed it to my dogc) The vet attempted justifying her case when she could tell I was disturbed by this She said "Well dogs eat anything they even eat out of the trash"  and "It's real cheese" wow Her only valid justification was "dogs need positive reinforcement after a visit" which I completely agree with BUT you couldn't find a more suitable option for a treat After speaking with the manager of the store Brenda I was told that they use Cheese Whiz as a distraction and treat for dogs because they like it so much Well yeah I'm sure they would like a Whopper and fries too but clearly that wouldn't be the best option for them When I asked her if she would recommend Cheese Whiz as a healthy treat for dogs she said "Well no but a little bit doesn't hurt" I highly doubt any veterinarian elsewhere would recommend Cheese Whiz as a suitable treat for dogs Needless to say I am not giving Banfield any more of my service.
If I was stoned out of my mind This place would be the bomb  But I was not So it wasn't Just a complete disappointment Clean the place up too I feel like I need a tetanus shot after leaving this place Gross.
We bought our blinds from Nu Vue when we moved into our new place They have a great selection and provided great service We are very happy with our blinds We were also very pleased with the timing and the cost We would definitely recommend Nu Vue to anyone in the valley looking for blinds or shutters.
This zoo is great  We have brought our two year old son here several times and he loves it  They have a lot to see and do  It is great idea to but an annual pass.
This place is great only problem I had was deciding what yo eat  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from everyone in our party was please with their lunch.
Alexi's is somewhere between Greek and Italian closer to the latter No matter - each entree is outstanding in its own right Last time in the desert cannelloni was spicy and delicious - and totally hopped up on chile peppers The salmon salad - magnificent - and perfectly cooked The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob The area has a loyal clientele of movers and shakers Alexi's is highly recommended in midtown - one of the best places especially for lunch in Phoenix.
Amazing exhibits and live performances  We went during a christmas piano performance and it was incredible  They also had a show with the musical machine from belgium in the mechanical music section  It was amazing to see who they created old time music boxes and paper based music machines.
Terrible service was just the start of my Groupon brunch experience We arrived late on a Sunday morning well after the crowd came through When I sit down at any restaurant I expect the wait staff to acknowledge me within a reasonable time It took the waitress five minutes to even stop at the table all the while checking in on the surrounding tables Also any time I visit a restaurant for the first time I tell this to the staff and ask for their recommendations on the menu The waitress ignored these cues and only asked what we wanted to eatAfter the long wait for drinks to come one of my dining friends realized that her glass was cracked I'm not talking chipped at the rim but a crack all the way down the glass When we finally get the waitress to alert her of the situation all she says is "oh" picks up the glass and walks away Not even an apology for filling up a cracked glass in the first placeI ordered the kalua pork and hash for my meal Let me be upfront that my standards for kalua pork are imu style I understand though that in metropolitan Phoenix this isn't possible The kalua pork here was just not good If L&L can do a decent kalua with liquid smoke I'd rather go there The kalua looked more like a condensed pork stew and was rather bland The location is good as well as the décor and ambiance however that's about it Not sure I'll return.
I've known Dr Lokey for sometime as a business associate  It is clear that she knows what she is talking about and cares about her patients  If you have kids they will receive great care from Dr Lokey.
Holy waffle sundae Love this place The wait as with every place in Scottsdale sucks But the food and service were outstanding The waffle sundae was excellent as was the chicken wrap.
Fluffy krispy kreme like doughnuts Girl at the front counter is very niceIt was my first time trying boba and thestaff is really helpful I had sweet milk tea bobaand it was DELICIOUS Small little family owned doughnut shop 10x better than Dunkin Will be a regular customer : ).
If I could give no stars I would--went here last December for a friend's birthday  While sitting in the bar a cockroach climbed up the wall behind her  I alerted the waiter who ran in back and disappeared for at least 5 minutes  In the meantime another patron still wearing a full suit from his work day had to kill the cockroach  Reported it to the state who went out and determined they should get rated a gold star  Disgusting I have not and will not return If there are cockroaches in December just imagine how many there are in the July heat.
Too bad we can't rate with a 0  A '1' is too generous  "Boooo" to Brewer & McLame  Terry Goddard & Rodney Glassman ALL THE WAY here in Arizona    :).
Here is my recommendation try anything here (it's ALL GOOD)  However my favorite is brunch here  You must try a Bloody Marythey make them with NM Red Chile instead of Tabascoit's delish  Foodwise I recommend the Enchiladas & Eggsadd green Chile chicken and you have a feast suitable for the Gods  This is definitely a splurge spot but it's my favorite  I have had probably over 50% of the menu and all is good  This place is tinyso it can be tough to grab a seat but well worth the wait if you have your heart set on some Amazing NM foodPlus let's care itwith enough Bloody Mary's EVERYTHING tastes awesome.
This establishment damaged my brand new sweater When I went to pick it up the brand name label was missing from the neck area and there was a hole where the label used to be When I showed it to the store owner he accused me of lying and saying that the sweater was not new and that it had been dry cleaned many times He asked for proof of purchase and kept saying that the label would not have fallen off by just cleaning it once Horrible service Horrible owner and an abhorrent attitude Never going back there again FOLKS KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
I have been to a lot of nail salons and this one is by far the bast Service was great and they do a great job Go here.
Fish Machaca it may sound weird and when they explain it as steamed seasoned fish as the healthy option you may be suspicious  Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors  The fried fish was done well too not over cooked and crispy  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla but I think this place may get you in to seafoodMy only grip is the price to amount of food Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal.
All baristas are not created equal The crew at Seattle Espresso knows how to pull shots They've got the best iced mocha in town They splash Illy with heavy cream Definitely worth driving to S Tempe for.
After having a SCAM like experience with the ATLAS Locksmith (foreign network inside the US) and nearly being burned by their dubious operations I turned to Avid Locksmith  Did some online research and noted Zach's stellar rating  He lived up to the ratings and feedback  He quoted me for the service call re-keying a front security door and provide 4 keys  His rate was what ATLAS Locksmith originally quoted me however ATLAS Locksmith did not live up to their word instead tried to raise the price during their service call  Are you kidding  No I am not  Zach was a professional and consistent thru the entire process and took my credit card over the phone  He even emailed me a copy of the paid invoice after the work was completed just like he said he would  Zach at AVID Locksmith is the real deal folks  He has been enlisted as one our trusted vendors  Thank you Zach.
Being a San Francisco native I fell in love with this place for many reasons  First the owner is from SFsuper nice guy who takes the time to get to know you  You feel like a "regular" right off the bat  Second the ambiance is fresh trendy and very clean  Third the food is AMAZING  You can't go wrong with anything you order  This is one restaurant that each time we go we try different things and we are never disappointed  Two of my favorites are the Grilled Halibut and Panang Curry  The Spring Rolls are a perfect light start to the meal  The flavors are aromatic fresh and perfectly cooked  I've notice some other reviews mention the portion sizes  I agree their apps and entrees are on the "smaller" side but this is comparable to some restaurants who serve you way too much food  I truly feel they serve healthy portion sizes  We've never walked away hungry (and my husband could be a champion eater)  I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home  )Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them welljust need to askLatitude Eight is a gem in Downtown Chandler.
Very disappointed in the Yucca Outside the entry door is a sign that states "Open at 6 AM"  Bullshit My coworkers and I went there this morning and the bartender never showed up We left at 6:30  We night shift people deserve  a happy hour just like the day shift people  This is not the first time we've waited in the parking lot past 6:00 AM for the day shift bartender  I think the Yucca needs to hire someone that can  get their ass out of bed and open the bar for us night shift people WTFWe will be looking for another morning bar  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
This is a fantastic library and a great spot in Phoenix One of the few places in Phoenix that actually makes me feel like I'm in a city  I love the building the staff and the selection  There is always something going on whether it be people watching either inside or in the parking lot classes book sales etc  I'm glad that I live so close to this library as I'm here almost weekly.
Love this store Clean store and has a large selection I hit it during the liter sales so I got real good prices.
Witnessed manager refuse to take back an order that was messed up Was an absolute jerk to a very nice lady who just wanted to exchange it for what she ordered Can not believe a manager could be so unprofessional Corporate if you see this have a talk with the manager on duty on 6-30-11 @ 6pm I can say that his attitude turned many people away that were in line Not good for your business.
Ted's is a classic Tempe landmark I grew up ni Tempe and this place always brings back great memories The food is all made from scratch fresh each day The staff is always friendly Try the italian sausage and potato salad Ted's never disappointsGet there by 11 for an early lunch or after 1pm to avoid the massive lines.
I have no idea how they ever received a 4 star rating This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back  John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese onions peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt Overall you would be much more satisfied going to your neighborhood Denny's than Hoosier Cafe in my opinion.
Great little space Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now His colorful slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun dammit and art can be too.
It was great the food the service and the ambiance  Definately will go back again.
Life's question to people who eat at Souper Salad: Why Why would you punish yourself with a crappy salad bar when you could spoil yourself by eating at Sweet Tomatoes Ohhhhh my gosh Sweet tomatoes: and endless ocean of comfort foods all you can eat for a low price Sounds too good to be true doesn't it I've been eating here since I was a little kid not at this one specifically but at this chain It is called Souplantation in California A huge line of salad goodies (a ton of yummy treats too many to name) usually 6-8 different soups potato bar pasta bar bread bar muffin/dessert bar fruit/jello etc and a soft serve bar Not to mention they have a pretty great beverage selection It's hard to not overeat here but I never feel guilty since I eat so many veggies while I'm here Beware if you go at 6 this place gets rocking for dinner If you're lucky you'll be there while they walk around with hot chocolate chip cookies Bottom line You like choices you like salad bars Eat here :-).
Our flight out of San Francisco was delayed due to maintenance issues We were flying to Phoenix connecting to a flight to Puerto Vallarta The delay would have caused us to miss the connection At first US Air suggested that we skip the first day (keep in mind this is a prepaid vacation) They then rerouted us to fly out of San Jose International I informed the rep that my ride will not be able to drop us off at San Jose and I'd have to park there Also the fact that we'd be flying back to San Francisco and I'd have to take a cab to pick up my car from San Jose I was told that it would not be a problem and that I should file a claim once back from vacation I filed a claim and all they can do is to apologize for the inconvenience and nothing else Very disappointingAirport and flight crews were great.
My husband and I had a reservation @ 4:30 when they first opened  We were the first customers there  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to begin with that was very good along with a martini My husband ordered the rib eye steak and was informed it was marinated in some kind of a soy sauce and pineapple mixture  In a reasonable amount of time our food was delivered to our table with a baked potato  It was lacking butter but had a tbsp of sour cream chives and bacon bits  It was definitely not warm (actually cold) but my husband and I ate it anyways  Each entree comes with one side that is shown in the menu  It is basically a la carte no salad soup or  bread which I have no problem with when the main entree is good  Next came the rib eye which my husband said did not taste good at all  He did not care for the marinade but said even without it the qualify of the steak was lacking  He sent it back and ordered prime rib  I had also ordered the prime rib and it was small somewhat chewy and lacking in flavor  When my prime rib was brought out by a girl that was not our waiter she said oh did you want horseradish  I asked if it was creamed or raw to which she answered I do not know  I asked her to bring out the horseradish and a side of sour cream in case it was very hot  The so called horseradish had no horseradish in it and no flavor at all   This was a first   I ate about a 1/4 of it and decided that was enough  My husband's prime rib was brought out about 20 minutes later  a larger cut than mine although they just have one size and it was very red and extremely rare   He was never asked how he wanted his prime rib  He was informed then that he could have ordered the rib eye without the marinade but this was never offered to him by the waiter or mentioned in the menu as an option  He said it was just okay but was disappointed again   I must say the waiter never returned to our table once my husband returned his food  He avoided eye contact with us and did not return to ask how the food was if it tasted good or if we needed anything else at that time  At the end  he asked if we wanted dessert and brought us the bill  I am sure you can guess that we will not give this restaurant another try.
I love this place besides always being too cold (bring a jacket) the food is always great From scrumptious omelets to delicious pancakes to perfectly cooked bacon Even their coffee is good they offer different flavors throughout the year The pancakes are huge you can get whole wheat (awesome) I usually get whole wheat pancake with blueberries and granola It's a great combo with a side of bacon and 1 pancake fills me up Going here for breakfast is definitely a treat.
If you hate waiting one to three hours at the DMV only to deal with rude associates then come to Desert Title I've gone here twice in the past year and never had to wait more than ten minutes and the staff is very professional and quick.
Cheap beer plenty of space live DJ and every NFL game on separate screen on SundaysProbably one of the more underrated bars on Mill (well technically it's 30 yards off from Mill) and I don't understand how this place gets a smaller crowd than the testy Vintage or slimy Rooftop But hey I'd be kicking myself if this place started getting crowded and I had to wait in line for it :D.
Ok so this review is based strictly on the fact that the parking staff weather contracted or not wasted 45 minutes of our life we will never get back After getting off the freeway and waiting 45 minutes in line to turn into the parking lot they made everyone turn around and leave the parking lot as it was full It would have been nice if they would have posted a sign prior to waiting in the ridiculous long line We won't be back.
Had Red Lobster tonight for dinner Not such a good idea I got the Rock Lobster tail that came to me partially raw (the entire bottom of the tail) I sent it back When I received the new one it was so overcooked and rubbery that I could have bounced it off of the floor and then it would have landed back on my plate Staff was very nice about it and was kind enough to remove it from our check Probably a good thing since I wasn't going to pay for it anyway.
I was on the hunt for a good croissant  Croissants are one of those things I find tricky  Most of them are terrible in these parts  I went to the bakery next to Federal Pizza owned by the Coes hoping to find a good one  The young man behind the counter told me that he believed the shop made them but he had only been working there for 2 weeks and hadn't seen any made in that time  I got on Yelp and since I didn't want to go out to Tempe to that apparently fabulous Essence Bakery I decided to go to French Grocery  I used to live around the corner from this place back in the day when it was a Circle K (hey that rhymed)  I used to scrape together $150 in quarters and walk there to pick up smokes  Yes back in the 80s cigarettes cost $150really  But I digressI went into French Grocery and it seemed pretty bare bones  The cheese case was tiny  Like you can get a better selection in the Safeway Deli Many of them weren't even French  But I was there for croissants  I was going to a friend's house for coffee and thought these would make a nice accompaniment to the brew  Wow  What a complete disappointment  I got 2 plain and two almond  The almond ones were hollow where they should have had almond paste  like the filling had melted out of them while baking  We were left with the merest hint of flavor  But the worst part  The croissant dough was just bad  Really bad  I've lived in 2 cities with large Vietnamese populations and they are known for their excellent bakeries  They were after all colonized by the French for a long time  Anyway I know my way around a great croissant and we didn't finish either kind  The plain were just wrong  Crusty like a biscuit not flaky and butterydense and very dry  It's almost as if they forgot to put the butter in the dough  The consistency was so unlike that of a real croissant they should take the French out of the name French Grocery  Quelle disappointment  I guess I'll have to continue my quest  Also they were way overpriced even for a great croissantBoo.
I'm so happy to have my grandson and my son and daughter in law living here We all love the shaded property which is so hard to find in the desert valley of Phoenix The staff is very friendly and attentive to detail Thanks for being an oasis in the driest state we have ever lived in.
so far this is the only place i've come back to get a steak in town I have yet to find a place in town that has a steak as tender as ruth chris's list of places i've gone to recently for comparisonmastro's city hallBLT capital grilldel frisco'shillstonehouston's STK (very close second best steak could be better but i need to go back :) )gallahers (vegas).
It definitely is as good as it gets I drive from NW Valley every Wed for produce Great choice fresh and yummy And the prices  wouldn't get better deal even if Walmart had such great organic produce Out of all farmers markets in the Valley this one is by far my favorite.
My all-time favorite bar in Gilbert  Friendly dive bar atmosphere and get this It's not sticky  All the bartenders are extremely nice and the owner is usually working  After my first time there they were already makingnan effort to remember my name  The have trivia games available  Everyone is friendly and there are always some kind of shot/drink specialThe drink selection is beyond impressive for beer  They have over a dozen different beers on tap  The bar is extremely long and there is always room for you and your group  Hightop seating as well as booths and regular tables are also available however I rarely use them sincei prefer the bar seating  There is 4 pool tables which are usually available except of Fridays which is tournament night  Karaoke is on Saturday but unfortunately everyone sucks  You really can't go wrong with this bar  Just remember this is a dive and not Mill Ave or ScottsdaleHad my birthday party here this year too bad I don't remember it.
OMG this food is amazing This is a hole in the wall place in Sunny Slope Staff is very very nice Everyone you pass will smile and say hello and welcome  Some reviews have said this place is dirty I did not find this place to be dirty It's in an aging structure and gets HIGH traffic Floor are clean and they are fairly new tile  This is a Mexican place and they do only place Mexican TV I say this because I know some people are bothered by this  I how ever came for the food Waiters all speak English very clearly I ordered the Torta Nortena Meat was tender with a lot of flavor Bread was soft and kept well with all the juice  This was amazing So frickin good I want to go back today My Mother in Law ordered a tostada "american" style just beans and cheese  The owner also brought her out on that is "mexican" style and gave it to her for free so she could try they difference  Very NICE Portions are more then enough to make you full and you will leave still wanting moreCost is suprisingly cheap for the portions and how wonderful the taste isMenu is full of original dishes of their own making and every item has personality  One of my new favorite places  I have to drive about 20 min to get there but well worth it.
My first time at a cajun seafood kitchen and let me tell you it was great  I wasn't so sure how the whole experience would go since I don't usually eat fish and I haven't had a lot of experience with cajun food either  But my hesitation quickly slipped away as the ambiance of the restaurant engulfed me  This is a fun placeIt was a busy night and so we had cocktails and appetizers on the patio--great patio  As our table came available we were escorted inside to nice location by the window  (I love tables with a view)  Our waiter was very helpful with the selections explaining in detail which dishes would suit our individual tastes Nice variety of dishes on the menu  My ceasar salad was was as nice complement to the shrimp etouffee and dirty rice  Everything was spiced just right and the favors were just wateringOur waiter checked back on us periodically just enough to keep in touch but not be a bother  He was attentive and concerned that his dinner suggestions met with our approval--they did  He was very good and I wish I could remember his name to give him a proper shout out Needless to say I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix---Love you Pappadeaux's.
Awesome idea  We stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar  We saw a couple drinking a six pack at the grocery store's outdoor seating and thought - we're so there  Not only is it a quaint local grocery store but they also serve breakfast lunch and dinner  Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique  We tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily  We also shared their hostess like cupcake - so good  And of course beer  I'd love to come back for breakfast as their english muffins are fresh and to die for.
The best Japanese restaurant in Arizona  Fresh varied and the staff were cool.
Wow this place is fabulous  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed  They need to open locations in the MidwestAlso I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever.
THis is my favorite V resturant in Phoenix I typically go here for lunch or dinner The food is extremely well priced and the food always tastes great While their Pho is great I recommend the Bun.
Oopshad a discussion with our waiter Ramon about food allergies  He assured us all would be fine  halfway through the meal we discover the exact ingredient in the food  The waiter never says sorryThe manager  Tommy Buck  shows up after a 5 minute wait and  demonstrates lack of experience  He offers to comp the offending dish  I ask him if he has any managerial experience as none is demonstratedHe gets very  defensiveThis is a shame as the restaurant ambiance is nice and our first dish was excellent   It is a shame that there is no longer adequate training in the service industry.
Holly was awesome and I was looking for a black cinnamon herbal mix She picked out a couple with me and actually suggested something out of left field a early grey tea which I'm not a fan of but one sniff and I had to try it I bought more then I thought I would love the prices of the tea I'll be back for sure since I just finished my tea about a week ago its about time lol.
I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype Happily it did The atmosphere the food and the wine all measure up at Postino the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and CampbellPostino is upscale but not pretentious The bruschetta really is out of this world but the salads are incredible too Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable even when the place was packed.
They are getting more Big flat screens Is that possible Just wanted to get a shout out about the amazing sound system and open concept of 360 degrees of football $4 bloody Mary's yesterday - man were they good with all the fixins Love this classy place.
The food wasn't good mostly fried tofu options instead of healthy vegan options Atmosphere: felt like being recruited for a cult The video playing on the tv was a very strange homage to the Supreme Master a woman who runs a big tv/internet religion that also runs this chain of restaurants If the food was good maybe it'd be easier to tune out but nothing was good about this experience.
I have been dining at Serrano's for years  I rarely change my order which is chicken burro enchilada style (red) rice only  They offer complimentary chips salasa and hot BEAN DIP  Its worth it alone to have the bean dip never had it better anywhere else  Luckily Serrano's is all over the valley and if you're in a neighborhood for a period of time you can count on Serrano's offering you their amazing dishes.
I love everything about this place The atmosphere is so inviting and I'm always a sucker for any twinkle lights and candles The patio is beautiful and plan on making my way there once it cools down I've been to this location twice and the food has always been outstanding Some of the BEST spinach dip ever and this place has one of my top 5 burgers The shoestring fries that accompany it are delicious Last trip we splurged after I read about the hot fudge sundae OMG I'm still thinking about it Great place for date night Excellent service Great food Can think of zero negatives Wellmaybe that I can't afford to go every night.
I worked with Chad from Mr B's Moonwalk for my kids' birthday party last weekend From start to finish I received nothing but the utmost professionalism and personal service You can tell he really enjoys the service he provides to families and makes an extra effort to make sure his customer is satisfied with their service I ordered a castle bounce house along with tables and chairs for our party at the park He was prompt the bouncer was clean and it made it really easy to be able to have them deliver tables and chairs tooThis was the 2nd time we have used Mr B's and this experience was even better than the first 2 years agoI will definitely use them next time I need a bounce house.
The only good thing about this place is the location It's less than a block away from US Airways ArenaWe decided to eat at this Pizza joint because we just finished watching Disney on Ice and my nephew was hungry The guy behind the counter was very rude and pushy on selling his "Combo Deal" which includes a Slice of Pizza Salad and a Drink for $550 I told him I didn't want to order the Combo deal but wanted to order a Whole PieHe says it takes about 45 minutes to make a Whole pie Answer me this: What Whole Pie takes 45 minutes to make Since he made it seem that  I had no other option so instead I ordered 5 slices and two soft drinks Each slice had to be reheated in the oven It took 15 minutes til our pizza was finally ready to eat At least that's what I thought  The Pizza was extremely hot greasy and tasteless I wish I read the reviews prior and would've just waited to eat somewhere closer to home with better pizza.
I'm new to AZ from GA and I'm currently living in up in the hills so when I get down I like to EAT  I ended up in Pita Jungle by dumb luck and I'm so pleasedI couldn't find the pho place and Tasty Kabob was closed but hey I like pitaI was already happy as it had the same atmosphere as one of my favorite hang-outs in Atlanta  I hoped the food would be as good and ordered the Shwarma Pita with no onions and the garlic potatoes  I'm not a big carb eater but the garlic sounded goodThe chicken had a wood-fired taste without the wood-fired dryness It was poached-moist inside The pita was soft fresh and lined with hummus which blessedly had flavors other than tahini It was delightful  The potatoes had that light crisp browning that gave them just enough structure to *poof* when bitten into  I would've liked to have seen the garlic roasted a little further as there were some bits that seemed a tad raw  There's garlic and then there's *garlic* (eyes cross) Apparently they have a jalapeno cilantro hummus which I think would be delightful on a bagel sammich so I'll be getting some of that to go when I'm back in town  *begins making list*.
Discount Tire is the ONLY place to purchase and service tires Could you save ten bucks at Costco Maybe- but you will not beat the service at Discount Tire SInce I got my first cars years and years ago I knew to go to Discount since that is where my family took our carsI went to this location to have my tires rotated Something I learned a few years ago is that you can call and make appointments at Discount Tire so I called the day before and made an appointment- which speeds things up and gets you out fasterThis location was recently remodeled and it looks great Comfy soft chairs bottled water and candy to snack on it's very nice As with the other employees they are amazing and work SO hard Discount Tire has a customer for life and I really appreciate the great customer service especially when I am receiving a free tire rotationWell done Discount Tire you're doing it right.
Loved this gym since day 1 Great variety of equipment Favorite part has been the time we've spent training with Kleven Such a motivator "Don't break it" Great staff and have handled all our "customer service" needs Gym always look clean and well maintained Been going for about 18 months consistently.
Horrible The rice is overcooked and there is no flavor to their food  I have tried this place three times-- never again How can Thai food be so bland.
Pita Jungle in Gilbert has been our go-to lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years It's always packed whenever we go and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly on point and attentive in their own ways Their menu has a wide range of mediterranean and some middle eastern healthy dishes and I don't think we've ever had something we don't like Today we had the mahi mahi with pita chips and some type of healthy veggie-pizza on a flat bread () Both were excellent We'll continue to go as long as it keeps rockin I'm surprised there are only a few locations in the valley.
If you are a cigar smoker then Goodfellas Cigars is the place to be They have a great spacious lounge with modern furnishings The owner is a great guy that really knows his cigars customer service and how to run an outstanding business The prices are very reasonable and they have a great selection of cigars humidors and  products They even have hard to get cigars and they are the first in the area to carry some rare or new cigars They have events quite often that are always a great time There is a poker room in the back humidor cabinets you can rent as a member and plenty of tv's and chairs to hang out in and catch a game  Walk in for the first time and I promise you you will always be coming back to pass the hours before you even realize it.
Not a good experience on my trip to AZ  I was in Scottsdale for a meeting and we made a reservation the day before for 35 people  Once we arrived we had a total of 2 servers (for 35 people)  The food I ordered was OK at best and served cold but due to all the other issues going on I decided to eat it rather then send it back and get back something worse Very slow service from the servers overall and when trying to leave and pay we couldn't get a check it was so slow that some of our party just threw cash on the table and left  We finally had to form a line by the cash register to pay our check The staff was overwhelmed most of the time and started to have attitudes with us they seemed to forget who the customer wasWe were not asking for anything outside the ordinary No owner owner on site also were told no managerso there was no one available to fix the problems we had  We waited for over an hour for our checks I would never recommend this restaurant to anyoneEVERwe even told our hotel and entire staff NEVER to send anyone to this restaurant.
Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas and their service has been great all the time) I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect I was pleasantly surprised The store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative All the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally He inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didn't have them there BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed Great The prices were not as heafty (relief) and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min) They apologized for the wait but no need for that The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely Thanks guysTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online They take walk-ins but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you.
Half side of the market is filled with hot ready to eat meals I'm so glad I came in here I'll never have to cook for myself again ).
I'm a craft beer lover and I have a new favorite breweryWe've been going here about once a week since they've openedTheir beer is incredible  I particularly like the slowly rotating lineup of Fate beers  Some of my favorites so far the Brown Imperial IPA Cream Ale Irish Red Oatmeal Stout Belgian Saison and Pale AleBut man can't live on beer alone  I think that we've tried all of their pizzas every one delicious  My favorites here are the Rustica Molto Carne Capicola Mediterranean and Fennel SausageThe staff friendly and helpful - the atmosphere casual and comfortable  And for desert awesome little cake pops.
Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer after driving by Really glad we did- our meal was incredible It's not a big place but it has a fun atmosphere decent sized bar and lots of patio seating which is nice starting this time of year We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal Not a huge beer menu but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint $10/pitcher) A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better I got the burger my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves Both were very tasty The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings I like a burger topped with a few things but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night Great flavor in the meat tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu too It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain served with grilled asparagus and fries We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries which they easily accommodated and she plowed through the hole thing Minus the asparagus- but that's on her not Grassroots :).
Jeff Sparks is a completely amazing profesisonal guy He came right after I called him and he is totally on top of it It was like $15 to get my door opened He swung by unlocked it and chatted for a bit and that was it Easy as cake I would definitely use him again especially since theres no "after hours" charge Senior Student and Military discounts as well Schweet.
Giant Coffee is the newest venture from the creative genius who brought us Matt's Big Breakfast and Roosevelt Similar to these other hot spots Giant Coffee is ultra hip and doesn't disappoint While in town I met with a friend for an espresso and instantly fell in love with the space The coffee shop offers a modern and hip retreat from the cement jungle I am a sucker for ultra modern loft-like spaces so instantly I loved the vibe Giant offered While I was there they had the space opened up so we had the pleasure of enjoying fresh air while sipping the rich dark coffeeThe coffee was delicious I am happy to find a non corporate chain coffeehouse in AZ The baristas were friendly hipsters so I felt right at home =)There is a $5 minimum if you use a card for payment But use a credit card so you can check out the Square technology on their iPadThis place is top notch and a welcomed addition to my future Phoenix visits.
Moe and the guys are great at this location Have been going there for about 4 years since they opened this location.
I've never walked into a store like Walgreens and been greeted with such enthusiasm and and warmth  I only came in buy some water but I was greeted once upon walking into the store another time while walking down an aisle and the cashier was gushing with customer service and wished me well as I walked out the doorColor me super impressed.
This is a strong Bible directed church There is a real effort made with kids to help facilitate growing up Godly young people My three youngsters love it as much as my wife and I.
i stayed here on business a few weeks ago my employer didn't make reservations for a me and a couple of my co-workers so on the day we were supposed to stay the front desk agent who took our reservation was accommodating and helped us reserve our rooms when we checked in the agent was also very nice she explained breakfast and checked us into rooms near each other this spring hill suites is very nice and well kept it's quiet and located in a great area (close to arizona mills) the only thing that was unpleasant was the light shining in my room all night while i tried to sleep this is entirely my fault because i did not check to see if the curtains were black out curtains wish i would have known would have gotten way better sleep hahahaha.
Queso Guacamole Amazing tortillas Freshly squeezed Mint LimeadeI loved the environment I felt very welcome and was totally entertainedMake sure you tell them if it is your first visit order nachos and get a surpriseWe will be back.
This is a awesome coffee shop in downtown Mesa Great place to grab a cup of coffee and hang out They have a awesome patio and good stuff to munch on if you are hungry Staff has always been quick friendly and very welcoming I'd recommend checking them out.
Wow I was not sure what to expect when we came here on Saturday night We live nearby and have seen a few restaurants try out this location and not make it very long But we love Hawaii and anything tropical so when we saw a place called Coconuts we had to stop in Holy moly this place was incredible The service: friendly but not intrusive Atmosphere: casual (order then sit and they bring food to you) Food: Hawaii in your mouth The coconut shrimp was light fresh and flavorful The fish tacos were heavenly One server told us people in Maui wait an hour to get these tacos and I understand why now I will be back Awesome patio too You gotta try this place.
I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day.
Great Japanese sushi restaurant  Food is awesome   Just about everything on their large menu is great  They have a lot of other choices other than sushi or seafood  We tend to over order there because everything on the menu looks great  One of these days I am going to try their pork belly.
Best burger I have ever eaten in my life Seriously.
They should rename the Genius Bar to the Halfwit Bar  Seriously they throw Genius around way too liberally  Google yields more helpful information than the simple condescending clowns  Scottsdale Quarter is offering upI love Macs but don't waste your time at Scottsdale Quarter  They have had to replace two of their $5000 giant glass doors already because they piss people off so much.
Delish Enough said Marcella's has made me fall in love with Italian food all over again Great prices and amazing food We ordered 15 dishes for our office and I can't complain about one From the Chicken Parmesean to the Layered Lasagna down to the garlic cheese bread and apple salads I was impressed with the flavor and presentation of it all  The restaurant is great for small and large parties or even a pickup order The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and very knowledge in their menu For those who are watching the carbs and a lil bit of a health nut they do have alternatives (gluten free pasta etc) As for their happy hour its great Half off their wine sangria (red & white) and their house pizzas which I might add are large and tasty Take boys if you're looking for a great locale for a date this is the spot the decor and ambiance is great.
I love ducking in here for a great glass of wine and some live jazz  The ambiace is cool and classy  The decor has that old world feel  The staff is knowledgeable about their wines and should be so  I have enjoyed the flights they offer better to taste a few at a time  There are so many wines to chose from doing the flights is the idealic way to go to  Enjoy yourself here and be whisked to another world for a few hours you'll be glad you did.
Just crappy Mexican food the best part was the Mexican flag in my food But this a disgrace to Mexico in every way possible Every single menu item taste the same  The salsa is watery and nasty Don't waste your time.
I have had the oppertunity of knowing and working with Randy for the past 20 years  He is the only tint comopany I will take my vehicles to (new or used)  My friends and family use Randy as well and have stated "they will always use him for tint"Customer service is a top priority for Randy and his wife Donna they are family owned and operatedIf your looking for a tint shopgo see Randy and tell him Dee sent ya.
I can't say enough about this storage center I was moving from Arizona to Eugene Oregon with my sons We had so much to do in a short amount of timeWe needed to store some items while we emptied out our house The manager Priscilla was wonderful to work with She helped us in every way she could Five stars for Five star service from start to finish If you need storage this is the place to go.
With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff Employees are like overly happy which is actually sometimes annoying but oh well But yeah In N Out hardly even needs a review everyone knows the food is always incredibleAnd Amanda B is right There used to be a little green house that was on this lot before they finally gave in.
Sooooo overrated  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their qualitywell just go to Denny's  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast  Not a fan of greasy food.
Great place for kids  Don't forget to ask about the Junior Ranger activities  There is a small indoor nature center and a variety of hiking trails around a lake and the river  The trails are all very kid friendly  Various signs point the way and name the floraI find that the Junior Ranger activities help engage kids who look around and after ten minutes of hiking say "What's next"  We usually go through three phases of Junior Ranger activity engagement  The first is antipathy  In the beginning it just seems to daunting  The parents start doing it and having fun  Then the second stage starts -- engagement achieved  Everyone is involved  Not only is the activity doable but it is fun  During this stage the family gets to explore the environs  After walking around the park there is usually just a narrative left that stands in the way of the kid and the reward  An insurmountable task during the first phase during the third phase get it done and get the reward it is completed in short order  Throughout the parents insert pearls of wisdom during obvious teachable moments  And at the end everyone forgets the first stage and agrees that they had fun the whole time.
HORRIBLE My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place so we decided to try it I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggsLMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease Sent it back left and went to mcdonalds WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS.
I loved the food just sitting hear thinking about  it makes me hungry I took my parents out for a treat as they don't eat out much at restaurants We all ordered different dishes Shahi Chicken Biiyanis Karahi lamb laajwaab mumtaz garden chicken We did not leave one piece on the plate it was all so delicious We got all of our orders mild as we don't eat too much spicy food at all but for me who is the most sensitive eater in the family I got a Mango Lasi which helps relieve any spice and just taste oh so good I can't wait to take my fiance to eat there as well as me and my parents have been bragging how good the food is there.
Once again  the negative reviews by fellow yelpers  can be so lame Talk about first world problems here News flash: mexican food can be very unhealthy Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging Salty spicy hot warm crunchThe molé here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole Seriously that good The margaritas are stiff and delish This place is here for the food not the service  though the service has always been great  This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind Major bonus: if you want to hear music play it on the jukebox Totally off the wall eclectic selection gotta love it.
Ate here for the first time loved it  Great service reasonable prices and awesome food.
My family and I ate here after a killer work out at CrossFit Mesa I am the owner of the gym and a big part of my coaching is giving healthy eating advice to my clients I was very pleased to learn that the Mesa Grill Co Had an amazing menu that allowed my family and I to enjoy a healthy Paleo meal in a nice burger joint setting The owner informed me that all the menu items could be made in salad form to avoid any grain or beef could be substituted with a 6oz chicken breast The nice thing is that these options are on the menu their not just winging it it's a menu that has been thought outWe will be regulars at Mesa Grill Co As long as they continue to serve awesome healthy food.
What a nice experience I took a leap of faith and tried these guys and to my surprise was blown away  My wife has a '79 Mercedes 450 SL and this year the A/C died  We took it to the Mercedes specialist we normally bring it to and after keeping it for 3 days he told us that it would cost upwards of $4500 to fix it  I dropped it off at Auto Air and Electric and they called me back in a few hours with an estimate of $850  I was happy but nervous   After they were done I was happier to find out he OVER estimated and the bill was $25 Less  WTH  When's the last time that ever happens  Air is blowing cold as anything  These guys have my business from now on.
For such a small "boutique" type store they actually have a lot to offer Their accessories and selection of ques stands and wall art are all packed right in without feeling cramped They sell Olhausen pools tables here Due to the limited space the day we were in they only have two in the show room but they allowed us to build our own custom table on their computer We were very impressed by Richard's good advise on the tables options and prices they came in He pretty much showed us everything good/bad about all the different types of rails skirts and stains for each of the designs we picked He even showed us the swatches of felt that we choose to see how they looked on a table The severices and follow-up they sell with the tables appear to be extrodiary compared with other pool table/ billard stores I reccomend them for their customer service we didn't buy a table from them but we are stillin the market so if we do I'll update my review.
Great place to shop  kind of expensive but you get what you pay for Alot of organic stuff here ~.
This review is particular to the 'Block Party' that Whole Foods puts on  I was invited by Yelp's own Ivonne B who ended up being my block party tour guideShe took us on a tour of the store stopping at several locations for a tasting sample  I've never had grilled pineapple before and it was such a treat  It was also my first time for Indian CandyIvonne is a spitfire and made our time spent there enjoyable and entertaining because she has a real passion for food and nutritionSure I love Whole Foods as much as the next person but the 'Block Party' proved to be the consummation of our loveAnd Ivonne let me in on a little Whole Foods customer secret which if it got into the wrong hands could be abused  I'll let you inquire directly from her.
Cheap prices with fast shipping and friendly phone service I happen to go through a LOT of toys due to my dog's need to rip out their entrails in 2 minutes or less Also I get his glucosamine supplements here for about 50% off what I was paying retail Awesome.
Crudo shattered potato chips deviled eggs meatloaf strawberry basil gin lemonade chocolate pudding rice pudding all of it soooo delicious And that's about half of the smorgasbord I noshed on those are just the favorites that really stuck with me Seriously the most amazing meatloaf I have ever had I never thought I'd use "amazing" to describe meatloaf but there you go.
In fitting fashion for the Glam frequenter i didn't take the time to actually read any of the other reviews  They're probably not as good as this one anyway  So i'm going to skip them  Yes  I'm going to do that  Maybe I'll read them later when i wake up around 3pm which will be an hour earlier than my usual timeOh yeah Glam rocks the block  Or it used to  I don't really know  I've moved on  But at one point it was my church and Faux Show DJs/Devon on the bar were my holy trinity  But that was a long time ago and as I've already said it probably sucks now  If this place was any LESS pretentious it would be a Scottsdale Ultra-lounge but since i forced myself into 'The Scene' one time a long time ago it wasn't I who was looked down upon  Fortunately  Because God be damned i had a kickass time here  You know a long time ago   But yes their drinks are strong and prices cheap and Devon is a twink who can make a drink  Plus they play lots of CSS LCD Soundsystem Datarock Los Campesinos and Mickey Avalon which is nice  Sigh  I miss this place  Or I don't.
My favorite place for wineI come here a lot but mostly for the wine The store is cozy and the staff is super helpful Their wine guy here can tell you just about anything about every kind of wine And if you're a World Market Explorer member you can get some sweet discounts tooAnother favorite about this place is the unique treats they have From chocolates to jam the food is great Overall the staff selection and wine make this one of my favorite stores in Happy Valley.
Great service and food.
Really good burger I got the Mexican burger and it was great And not to expensive.
Having just relocated from the Northwest where there are tons of great doggy daycares I started to panic a bit when locals in Phoenix told me that there aren't many daycares in the area  Luckily I found out about Fido's after a vet in the area told me about the place  I absolutely love this place as does my high maintenance yellow lab  The staff is extremely friendly and clearly love dogs which is one of the most important things I look for in a doggy daycare  And they give great baths  As far as boarding I will not leave my dog overnight at any daycare that does not have someone who is on site overnight in the event something happens  Fido's always has someone stay the night which gives me the peace of mind that I need when I'm traveling  They also are picky about dogs who can stay there which means that they screen out the aggressive dogs  The only negative about this place is that it doesn't have any outdoor play areas but given the heat around here that fact doesn't impact my review and certainly won't keep me from going back  I know that my dog is safe pampered and surrounded by friendly dogs and staff which keeps me coming back  Overall a fantastic place that I will visit whenever necessary even if it's a bit out of my way.
Best sashimi eating experience in the Valley When you come to Roka do yourself and favor and spend the extra dollars to get the Omakasi (you can get plain old sushi elsewhere)  After you order be prepared to spend 2-3hours leisurely enjoying your courses  No sense rushing food this good  Skip the soy sauce please--the fish is so fresh and flavorful drowning it in soy would be a terrible waste  The butterfish is perfectly dressed and tuna salmon cuts are so delicate  One particular cut of tuna was so wonderfully marbled it melted upon contact with my tongue  Dessert is just as nice usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruitI've been here several times now and the service is always on point-waiters are attentive without being in your face  The cocktails are also pretty good  Although I've never tried their wine selection they have enough selection on the menu to pass my inspection.
This is a great place for who ever likes original east coast subs The meats are sliced wright in front of you  Very fresh Friendly staff.
I tried out this restaurant a few weeks ago when it just opened  I think I got the pan friend noodle entree with beef  It was delicious I also had a taste of my friend's noodle soup and it was light but fulfilling  I did not get food coma after I left this place which I think is a good thing  I am Vietnamese and I heard Cambodian cuisine is similar to Vietnamese food or at the least it got it influence from Vietnamese cuisine  Though I cannot critique Cambodian food with much authority I've eaten homecooked Cambodian food at my friend's house before so I can say Sekong by Night's is comparable to homecooked food :)  Give it a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
bartenders always friendly nice to come by here after work with all my co-workers and relax for a bit easy-going atmosphere and hh pricing always good.
I love this place We ate there last night for the first time Had the St Louis Pork Ribs Can't say enough about the experience and and where else can you get a shot of whiskey along with a Kona Pipeline Porter chaser for 3 bucks early on a Saturday nightThe staff is excellent the service is perfect and the ambience is great Hello WiFi ahh  yes.
Love this place only wish I could convince the wife to go more often  My first experience with L & L was not in Phoenix but in Hawaii  Sister in law picked us up took us out to L & L in Hawaii Kai and took the food and ate on the beach with the waves rolling in  Of course it was excellent food  And of course once I returned home and saw the L & L up at Happy Valley I had to try to recreate that moment  And normally when you associate food with a very nice memory like that the next time you have it the food won't compare  Well guess what  The food at the Happy Valley L & L tastes just as good as what I had on the island sitting on the beach  That is a winner for me anytimeIncidentally I normally get the BBQ Mix plate (2 mac 1 rice no cabbage) which is the perfect amount of food to feed me for two mealsif I'm able to show enough restraint during the first meal to not reach the 'point of no return' (where you don't have enough food left for the second leftover meal)  Five stars for the tasty grub friendly service and clean store  Also kudos for the cherry cola in the soda fountain.
Still get 5 stars Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine Glllrrrbbbl Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed We love this place They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa Fortunately they will be even closer to us :)We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine Not cheap but you get what you pay for You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant)Beaver Balls are next on my list to try.
What a disaster Our food was late they lost our orders they do not take separate checks The food when it finally came was very good but the service was worse than any place I have ever ate in my life This is 25 hrs of my life I will never recover.
Shannen at NextAesthetics is the absolute best Aesthetician ever  I have received facials for many years and from Shannen for the past five years  Shannen's facials by far exceed all others  Through her customized facials superior product and "magic" hands my face looks and feels the best it ever has  Shannen is constantly learning new technologies and treatments Next Aesthetics offers  Everyone in the NextAesthetics office is professional knowledgable and friendly and I highly recommend NextAesthetics for cosmetic treatments.
If your ever in the Peoria area and your craving something sweet stop by and get your fix These donuts are one of the best besides rainbow donuts on 51ave & Thomasit's heaven in your mouth they're so so good that I bought the two donut deal and I said to myself " ok I'm gonna take one to my co- worker and on my way to wrk I just couldn't hold back so I ate my co-workers donut" I know I knowI'm so so badbut it was so scrumptious Next time i'll get a dozenoh and try to pay cash because there's a 50 cent charge on debit or credit cardsso the only drawback is that they didn't tell me and I could've got another donut because i actually had cash on me that dayand I think you need to warn customers about their feesso it got me a little madbut it still gets 5 stars cause they're scrumptious : ).
This is one of my favorite Mexican food joints in town  We've been going here for 4 to 5 years and each time have had a great meal  The food is consistent and savory  The atmosphere is somewhat basic but they have a great value for the food served  If you like a hotter than average salsa the green Hatch chili salsa is awesome  The sopapillas at the end of the meal are always a wonderful treat.
OK Here goes Saturday night date- I picked where I wanted to go Crap MISTAKE #1  IPIC  sucked once again and this is the 3rd time I was there I don't mind spending my dates bucks on high  priced things to do and eat- nor my own money for that matter if it means I  get to stay  in my neighborhood-Scottsdale but this IPIC theater  is such a rip off in more ways than oneHere me out HonestlyWe buy the tickets for $54 and I head for the  bathroom  A huge line of women in the bathroom (which is gorgeous) BUT--there is NO toilet tissue in the stalls The crappiest thing about that is- the women coming OUT of the stalls do NOT say a fking word to the ones waiting in line to use the stalls Really And they are smiling nasty bitches- ya have to wonder now- how clean those fancy loungers really are now with them sitting their un-wiped ass's on the movie seats now Ok- here is what happens next  Theater #7 Saturday night Feb 25th 9:30pm  show We find our seats and once the movie starts- our seats are vibrating like someone is kicking them from behind I keep looking around and no one is in back of methen I realize it's the sound system Now that is annoying to have to sit in a seat that is vibrating- NOT the good vibrating way (naughty people)  but super annoying wayOk next-The sound system was so messed up in this theater that  it actually became an annoyance to sit thru the rest of the movie being tortured by the bad BROKEN sound system that shoots out a high pitch every 5 minutes Warning too- People that  must drink vino and alcohol in the movies and eat in the movies are FAT slobs Just saying the truth They were making noises the waiters are getting in the way of the movie screen and they are all  talking loudly cause they are DRUNKEN ass holes- and  then- the smell of their drunken  farts from them stuffing foods in their pie holes and drinking during the movie is disgusting Hello Cine Capri- here I come-never again to be in the IPIC itty bitty theater of human gas bombs- bringing my own toilet paper  and jiggling in the sticky chairs form the nasty women who didn't wipe their %$#@ in the bathroom.
REVIEW PURELY BASED ON HAPPY HOUR:WOW  where do I begin1 amazing happy hour prices (drinks too) DRAGON ROLL $62 fast service3 friendly staff4 great music5 overall perfect nightexcept for the random girl bringing us a round of sushi and just standing next to our table without saying ONE WORD Just looking at us  Not saying what she has or anything normal  It was weird.
Very great food.
Was with a group of 9 slow serviceit was croweded and the waitress hardly saw our table  People just ordered mutlipe drinks at a time anticipating slow serviceOrdered the most expensive thing on the menu the rib-eye  Worst piece of meat I've ever had  One half was cooked rare the other half was mediumwith more fat on it then meat  Waitress asked me to be honest about how it was and I said ok and that was the end of itthanks  Never again.
I've been eating at The Wild Thaiger at least once a week for the last 3 yearsHands down this is the best thai food I have ever had I have never been dissapointed by anything I've eaten here The staff and owner are always friendly and attentive and the prices are reasonable I would probably eat here every night of the week if I had the chanceAll of the appetizers are delish but the dragon eggs are probably my favorite tasty dumplings with a tangy sauce topped with jalapeno rounds so good Their crab crisps are the best you will ever have My favorite dish of the moment is the Rama of the jungle Delicious melt in your mouth beef skewers with flavorful rice fritters and spicy green papaya salad YUM All of their curries are amazing and so is thier peanut sauce There is honestly nothing here I wouldn't recommend I even like their tofu dishes and normally I won't eat tofu Oh and don't forget dessert awesome cheesecakes and coconut ice cream even a delicious chocolate cake  If you love fresh mouth-watering thai food check this place out I'm sure you will enjoy.
I love Sweet Tomatoes I can pig out on lots of good stuff here and with the ClubVeg coupons its very affordable.
Best bike shop in town very knowledgeble staff all around good people trust me stop wasting your time with these other shops that wont even remember your nameGreat experience I promise.
Snottiest most arrogant office I have ever been to  After waiting 90 minutes past our appointment time without so much as an "I'm sorry we are running late" or "would you like a glass of water"  some snotty woman comes out and lectures us about how special his excellency is and how we should all be good little boys and girls   Find another office.
This is a beautiful modern library It lets in a lot of natural light for reading It was built to reflect Arizona's geology (sun canyon formations etc) and you will notice the "canyon walls" feel in the atrium The outside resembles a mesa from the side There is a large collection of books (though you will find a more scholarly/academic selection at Hayden Library at ASU Main) and plenty of space for reading Floor-to-roof windows cover the north and south ends of the building and whether or not you wish to do any reading you will get great views of Downtown and Midtown Phoenix from the top floor.
We saw it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to go with apprehension Guy did not steer us wrong The Goat Karahi was the perfect combination of flavor and heat with a blend of spices I just placed an order to go while thinking about it Best in town but if you dont trust my culinary palate then look no further beyond the walls littered with awards If you are hungryGo NOW.
You're kidding me right 5 stars On a 50 point scale maybe When I held up the pizza to the light I could blasted see through it If I want to pay $16 for pretty air I'll come back The only positives were spending time with my colleague and Dave our server - the nicest fastest most courteous guy in the joint And is the only reason it got a single starDon't know why this place is so overrated Save yourself some time money and culture - order togo from Buca.
All 5 & Diners are not equal This location is one of my favorites--they just seem to go the extra mile It doesn't matter what time of day I stop inmiddle of a weekday after midnight on a weekendthe place is friendly and busy There is another closer to my house but this location wins my heart every time Another bonus Their table side jukeboxes actually work Our most recent visit  was for post-fireworks dessert We finally tried the new menu The Waffle Wonder was a hit Half a waffle (by the way this location's waffles are superior to all others) covered in cinnamon sugar vanilla ice cream chocolate syrup and caramel It tasted like a supercharged churro So yummy My friend got the Diner Split which might seem run-of-the-mill but it had a large scoop each of vanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream with all the requisite sauces plus a deep fried banana Yep you heard right deep-fried freakin' banana I had a chocolate malted and could not have been happierNext time you need a great way to cap off a late downtown night check this place out.
First time experience with Zia Recordsimpressed with the staffAdam (on phone)answered all my questionsvery polite friendly & located the CD I wanted quickly & held it for meI visited the store to pick-up my CD & the girl at the counter Shona was amazingWe had a great conversation & she was a very unique person an artist & I enjoyed her comaraderie & picked up my CD & left the store as a 'happy camper'.
I have been here so far quite a few times and have not been disappointed yet Great atmosphere great food great live music on fridays and saturdays I have been here for both dinner and drink and for lunch and a beer The atmosphere is always laid back and never really uncomfortable Looking for a great irish pub experience here in phx az Rosie McCaffrey's is your place for small and quaint Enjoy.
Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in PhoenixI get the classic which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese It's the only thing I've ever ordered there because it's so damn good I can't pass it up AND they get their beef from humanely raised grass-fed cows And beer selection and the fries with aioli Well others here have told you how good they arePro tip Throw a little of that aioli on your burger too Oh and come hungry--it's a generously sized burgerIt's a little pricey but Delux is a really delicious treat.
I recently took my brother who was visiting from out of town to this place and we both absolutely loved it I tried the Sunbru beer which was nice and light with fruity tones to it My brother had the oatmeal stout which had a much bolder flavor with a malty oat undertone Both choices were great to start off our meals We also got the Bavarian pretzels and Four Peaks cheeseburger for our meals The pretzels were great since they were still warm and soft by the time they brought them over to our table It's sprinkled with bits of coarse salt but not overly done to the point where all you taste is the salt It was a perfect pairing with my beer I snuck a bite of the burger from my brother and that was really tasty but huge Sometimes you really do need a fork and knife to tackle on that burger Our food was definitely filling Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Tempe area What really amazed me is the fact that they actually brew their own beers right in the restaurant Towards the back of the restaurant you can see all the giant tanks where they store the beer.
Aside from the couple of negative reviews that I have read this place is as good as it gets for a combination of good people good service good food good entertainment and good prices  I especially enjoy their Karaoke on Tuesday night  Very friendly atmosphere where everyone knows everyone else  I highly recommend this restaurant for an all around enjoyable evening.
Not good at all.
Zia is a great place Service is good and not pushy Prices are fair to cheap Nice atmosphere and variety It's where I buy all my movies and CDs.
We ate here last night to celebrate our 16th anniversary  I used open table to set up the reservation and also ordered flowers through FlowerPetal  Eddie V's set up the roses and made a rose petal heart around the vase  :)We both had the filet mignon which were cooked perfectly to medium rare  Our waiter Brian was attentive helpful and professional  He helped suggest a wine that suited both of us perfectlyGet the banana Foster butter cake  OMG it was AWESOME  DudeThe manager also stopped by our table and wished us a happy anniversary and stayed and chatted for a few minutesEvery time we've been to Eddie V's we've been treated like VIPs  We love it.
I came in today to ship some packages because the post office was a mad house  It was busy for a kinko's but I was helped promptly and efficiently  I get a discount with my company to ship things here so it is a great alternative to waiting in line at the post office  I have also used this location to fax and it was fast and simple to do.
With the closure of one of my favorite nearby sub joints - Port of Subs on Scottsdale - I find myself pleasantly surprised to find another great sub joint pop up nearby This one perhaps even better than my old favoriteSee I don't like to eat at sub joints that get their meats shipped in boxes pre-sliced who knows when Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered I'll miss that but Silver Mine is close They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts That means it's still very fresh The quality of their meats and bread is great as well Their bread is especially good The restaurant is clean - immaculate even The employees are all really nice dudes So friendly I doubt they're even from here They must be from the Midwest This place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m Their brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard They carry a great selection of chips and bev and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there Their menus get revised every time I order from them They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something I have yet to win a car or my own franchise but they popped up all over town at some point recently If I did win my own sub shop I'd change the tag line to "You can't beat our meat" because that's what the people would wantSeriously these guys are cool and the food is good.
Amazing.
very cool restaurantopen kitchen great service great staffmy only complaint here are the portions  don't go here if you are hungry - this place is more about presentation  very good but very smallThis placed was packed on a random weeknight so make sure to call ahead for rezzies.
On average I go here MINIMUM 1X a weekalready been there 2X in the last 3 days so that tells you what a regular I am  Have met the owner multiple times and he's super friendly and always remembers us  They change flavors regularly and the flavors are SOOO yummy  You can even get ones with no sugar in them that are delicious (chocolate dipped strawberrieshad it tonightgreat)  Their website has all of the weight watchers points too which is kind of nice  Their toppings are the best - fresh fruits AND some of your standard stuff (M&M's cookie dough sprinkles etc)  Great ambience and the teenagers that work there are always friendly  Glad to have Yo Love in our neighborhood.
Great staff great prices as always Thanks.
I travel alot and have to try and watch what I eatso this placewho knew  Has calorie counts will custom make what you wantand is pretty good on the wallet.
Great product friendly service convenient location huge selection of toppings that are displayed nicely This place is a winner My only little piece of constructive criticism is about the frequent customer card While it is awesome that they even offer it in the first place the maximum value of your free 10th item is only $300 It would be nice if the value was more near the amount most customers spend on a typical visit I find that my usual yogurt creation is in the $450-$5 range and I'm thinking that's actually even lower than most people I feel bad even bringing this up because anything for free is better than nothing for free but I think it is worth mentioning so some people aren't surprised when they fail to read the fine print before redeemingEdit: I just received a very nice message from someone at Zoyo letting me know that the $300 maximum is just there for their protection and so people don't take advantage of the promotion According to them everyone has received their 10th yogurt for free so far no matter what the weight has been Good to know I definitely appreciate the personal attention to my review (And no they didn't ask me to edit my review which is exactly why I am doing it).
Came in at 2:45 on a Saturday afternoon 3 people working Not one other customer in the store Every single table and the whole floor were disgusting Made me a little scared to venture into the restroom Processed rubbery meatyuck   Go to port of subs where they the meat fresh or firehouse which is just yummy all the around.
I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars not quite a 5 but really some of the best food we have had in AZ  The food was spicy and well flavored  The ingredients very high quality and fresh  The guac was chopped not mashed great texture  There was no mashed beans or puke looking typical Mexican preparations  Everything was lovely  The Margaritas were the best I have had here they do not use that revolting sweet and sour mix instead they use agave nectar  Service a bit wonky but we still had a great time.
Just passing through townstopped in to get a pedicure and got the women from hell with a bad attitude  down right rude customer service skills don't have her redo anything cause she will get mean and nasty with you it was just one lady here who was the rotten apple wish I could remember her namebut the other people that work there know who she is should have gone to Valley Nails in Mesa that was recommend by a lady from the hotel.
Fast friendly and deliciousMy favorite Large supreme with extra jalepenos.
I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options which is an odd (in a good way) feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices but overall I really like this place and will come back The atmosphere is great and service is attentive I had:- Herb hummus: Regular hummus dressed up with greek crudites (olives cucumber tomato feta etc) served with yummy soft pita bread This is a great app to share- Meditterean Salad: Like two meals in one It was mostly quinoa and my only complaint is that it should come with with more lettuce/arugula or be relabeled as a Quinoa Salad There were tons of yummy feta and marcona almonds which with the quinoa made a very filling meal- Strawberry seasonal soda: Yum - fruity and spritzer and so refreshing Kind of pricey at $4 with no refill but so perfect for a warm summer day.
Great people will order anything I need (I have horses and they don't keep horse feed in stock at this location) great prices and so convenient Always shop here for all my kiddos (horses and dogs :p ).
Best Pho place in town Their secret is in the broth which enhanced everything in the soup especially the rice noodlesI would drive 20 miles just for their Pho.
Great place Great lunch specials I pretty much rotate between the sandwiches pho and vermicelli noodles The best spring rolls Great people too.
Born and raised in this place for the most part I've been coming here for over twenty years This restaurant is not traditional Mexican food but it makes no claims to be The fajitas here are the best in Phoenix hands down The seasoning on the meat and shrimp is perfect the salsa and queso are both fantastic The customer service is phenomenal.
I love it here Don't be intimidated by the line as it moves quickly It can be difficult to tell all of the flavor options are without getting in everyone else's way but the staff is very patient and you can sample anything I love the way the staff will bring out water and samples of their other drinks while you enjoy your gelato.
Now this is what I'm talking about  I've been waiting for JA to open since I used to frequent the one back in IL when I lived there My girlfriends and I had lunch there today Not only was the meal delicious but the service was off the hook -- thanks LukeThe ladies and I were all jonesin' for the rotisserie chicken Loved it I substituted the mashed potatoes for the vine ripened tomatoes Yum  And get this -- I wanted some of their skinny french fries and jokingly (well sort of) asked Luke to snag a few for me from the kitchen  After a couple of minutes he showed up with a plate of fries for all of us to share  And not that I wasn't full already we shared the white chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce for dessert IncredibleFive stars all the way for J Alexanders Looking forward to heading back soon.
This place is great On our 3 day trip we came in twice and would have come back on our way to the airport but our car was running late The juices are amazing and fresh and after seeing the food come out the first day we were back the next to try it  The breakfast sandwich with fresh arugula ham and cheese topped with two over easy eggs was a perfect way to start the day My husband raved about the tri-tip sandwich too We will be back every time we visit Scottsdale and will miss it until then.
Great food  this location is inside of a shell station (Circle K products) The popeyes employees don't care if you get a drink from the Circle K side (as long as you order chicken  duh) Great for lunch or dinner And on tuesdays they have the $1 special.
After reading all the rave reviews about BLT Steak's happy hour I wanted to try it for myself Yelpers once again you have not failed me The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic Boyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio The atmosphere is comfortable romantic and warm We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu They have several drink options and many food options We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must) the charcuterie plate the burger and the truffle friesHands down the standout of the night was the popovers They were huge fluffy and full of eggy goodness They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popoversThe burger was very tasty A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right The fries were my least favorite I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering Not my thing I guessThe service was really good too Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50 I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion Well played BLT Steak I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour It was the dining highlight of my weekend.
I love this place I often bring my 4 year old and 2 year old here and they always have a great time They love the playtown as well as the art and puzzle rooms They sell snacks and drinks for very reasonable prices which is a nice plusThere are also several pricing options -- punch cards one time passes yearly memberships which I appreciateThe new owners are super nice and friendly They always take the time to make parents and kids feel welcomeThey have recently started offering special activities such as storytime art classes etc as well I took my older daughter to the princess tea party which she absolutely loved There was a princess on hand to make balloon animals lead the girls in dances and paint faces There were also princess themed activities as well as lots of delicious food that parents and kids could both enjoy My daughter and I are both hoping they will have another princess tea party soon.
I've been to Unphogettable at least a dozen times in the past 8-9 months and absolutely LOVE it Their food is relatively healthy in comparison to other Asian cuisine restaurants and the Pho is AMAZINGI've eaten at Da Vang about 4-5 times and this place is MUCH better The broth in the Pho is flavored perfectly and the meat is oh so tender I always get the #4 Pho with brisket and the #17 egg rolls both of which are amazing The food is delicious but it's the service that really makes this place After having visited only 2-3 times the owners now recognize me and my family when we come in and helpfully explain how to eat the food to maximize the experience The prices are reasonable the food is good and the service is top notch.
If you love burger this place is a must visit  Love all the choices  All the staff are friendly also.
Pharmacy is the WORST  Waited in line for a flu shot  to be told to get in another line  After 15 minutes in the 2nd line we filled out some paper work and were given a beeper They said in 15-20 minutes when it goes off go up to the register  pay and get your shot  Ok after almost 1 hour at Costco later it goes off we go up to the pharmacy register with our little buzzer to be told to get back in line of over 20 people no thanks.
Came here for Christmas dinner with my mother Big mistake 7 o'clock and they were packed I couldn't believe it We waited 20 mins for a table (which we didn't mind we were in no rush) After getting our drinks we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer We waited and waited finally like 20 minutes later watery guacamole (it looked like pea soup) and the WORST tortilla chips came out The chips were so stale we couldn't finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease We spit it out and told our waitress She brought us new chips that were not much better but edible We kept the soupy guac as we hated to complainthey were so busy we just blew that off I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken I don't do dairy so asked for no cheese Waitress said no problem Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries The food came after 35 minutes My pasta with extra cheese Ughand 4 of the rawest shrimp sitting on top Sent it back because I can't eat cheese Waitress brought a new one without cheese I like my shrimp well done or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp She brought the new pasta it was ice cold Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot againresulting in it being dryer than dry Ekkk Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease Literally She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter And the shrimp was missing from her plate After asking several times they finally brought it Nothing special Just shrimp We used a coupon buy one get on free They charged us 6$ for my four raw shrimp It was ridiculous Yes it was Christmas but really This experience should have been better Even for Christmas night I don't think we will be back.
A brilliant concept Fresh tasty food and drinks (and a yummy looking pastry bar) all while you get the best car wash of your cars life The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch (crap cakes on mixed greens) and browsing the stores cute little market section I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot.
"Ordinary food done extraordinarily well" or something like that is their motto and you can take that to the bankJoe's Farm Grill is pretty inconveniently located for me (I am in north Phoenix Joe's is in southeast Gilbert) but every so oftenit's worth the tripJoe's angle is that it literally is a farm and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm This translates into basic diner faire of outstanding qualityTheir burgers and fries are out of this world and their onion rings are possibly the best I have ever had Homemade cheesecake lemonade pizza all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere elseThe location is very clean and if the weather is nice their outdoor seating is gorgeous Even their bathrooms are something to admire (you'll see what I mean)I don't get out in that area much but when I do I always try to get out to Joe's Highly recommended.
Great friendly family owned and operated Always a pleasant experience I like tipping more and often to encourage small business and retar reward great service I love the grilled cheese and rc soda And free refills on same visit.
I had a terrible moving experience with S & M movers and United Every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces My kitchen table was unable to be repaired For an unknown reason they had disassembled the base of the table and when they delivered it there were missing pieces and they were unable to assemble it They wanted to compensate me $48 for a table that was $1000 brand new  Furthermore I'm now stuck with trying to get rid of a broken table and the four chairs which is difficult because I do not have a way to transport it (Thus the reason I hired movers to begin with)  My most fragile and valuable item was my road bike  I very carefully packaged it for the move and it arrived partially disassembled with damage to the gears  The compensation they offered to fix it was $35not even close to what it will cost I would assume there would be some damage when moving items 2000 miles across country but the condition of my furniture and boxes was unacceptable Try another company and hopefully you'll have better luck.
Paul is unbelievable Very helpful Conscientious about how much you will be spending but also wants to do things right He very clearly outlined my options even over the phone - including options of not using his services When he did come I could see that he was very particular and did the job very carefully and completely The job started taking longer than he expected but he insisted on me paying him for the original guesstimate of time Very patient very helpful very good at explaining what he is doing He has been in the specific RO business for years and takes pride in what he does I can't say enough good about this man I found him on Yelp and saw all the good reviews and thought I'd give him a try I'm glad I did I would recommend calling him and talking to him You will know right away that he is the man for your job.
The Lox Eggs & Onions was delicious.
We read about Giant Coffee from Phoenix Magazine and I tried it on a whim I was not disappointed The honey vanilla latte in particular was very good as was the cherry almond scone Prices were good.
great music reasonable cover and strong drinks.
WowThis was a damn good burgerStaff was very niceplace was spotlessI will be back.
I've been here a few times and every time has been impeccable  This is by far my favorite fine dining restaurant in the Valley  Fresh local food transformed into the most delicious meals by an amazing chef  If you are looking for the most romantic setting or the best Phoenix food or amazing service or some combo of the above please check out this restaurant  You will be amazed  I HIGHLY recommend the Farmers Feast with wine pairingsAnd if you haven't been to the Farm come a little early and wander around the Farm and check out the chickens and flowers and lovely pecan trees.
Purchased the Groupon for the tri-pak of oils which they were out of  Was told they would arrive in 15 minutes waited 20 minutes and left  Waste of a trip guess they couldn't come up with a solution to give me another product to subsitute what they didn't have  Ruined my experience to ever go there again.
This place is brand new clean and reasonably priced.
Best Pho ever The broth is Pholicious No need to go anywhere else.
Must be patient Restaurant ran by literally two people  Great food worth the wait   Enpanadas tamales way to go Their ceviche awesome too.
I firmly believe they have the best hummus around I know people love Pita Jungle's hummus but that is nothing compared to this creamy goodness I don't think have ever had hummus so creamy and smooth I have eaten here a few times and it has been delicious but honestly I prefer just stopping in on my way home and picking up a container of hummus and homemade arabic pita bread (also super delicious and soft) I highly recommend it.
We tried the store over Avondale and it was fine but this store BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER We stayed right next to the bell location but it didn't "look safe" according to my wife so we came over here Great location (area) staff was friendly and store was super clean.
I love Postino I live a few blocks away from the Arcadia location but go to Central probably one out of every four times My boyfriend lives downtown and it's more convenient sometimes I've grown to enjoy this location slightly more than Arcadia due to the airy atmosphere and large open bar area Don't get me wrong--I still love Arcadia very muchLike everyone else I love the bruschetta but I tend to come for brunch more often now The french toast is probably my favorite menu item I admit that I might indulge in a glass of wine before the clock strikes noon Usually it's a Mimosa for me though Here they are made the way they should be (more champagne than orange)   -) Yay for Postino  :-).
Out of a lot of fish especially for a Sunday lunch  The sushi after we received it was subpar it kind of tasted old and had a sticky residue on it  The onlyGood thing I had was the goji roll which was fried shrimp sirracha and other yummy things  I eat sushi all the time and coming here made me feel like I knew more Han the Mexican making it.
Yum and more Yum  We went for dinner and got really lucky that we didn't have to wait The bruschetta is wonderful and they have a great wine selection  Just thinking about how good everything was makes my mouth water and I want to go back.
Love this placevery intimate atmosphere.
Inta Juice is awesome The owners are friendly and consistently deliver a quality product Love my Sunshine Passion on a hot summer day.
I am still thinking about the gnocci I had at Circa 1900 back in July Any dinner that remains deliciously vivid in my memory for four months has got to be worthy of five starsI had a great time with one of my good friends We were excited to see they used Effen vodka to make their martinis and had a great blackberry cosmo I was afraid it would be too fruity for me but it was fabulousI had a fresh tomato salad - perfect for the Arizona summer - and a very light gnocci dish with a delicate broth and mushrooms We didn't get a chance to have dessert because we were running to a movie - Another great thing about Circa 1900 is its location We were able to walk to the Arizona Center to catch our movie and then rounded out our evening with some ice-cream at Cold Stone.
I got food here twice  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling  The first time the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch)  The second time it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor)  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time.
Gluten free options Awesome italian soda/creme drink Not to mention I found out you can order/eat at the espresso bar and skip that long line on the weekends Definitely going to be back here again for breakfast Ps the owner is very friendly.
Really good Do yourself a favor and order the pork bellyor anything for that matter.
I discovered Rage Cycles after moving back to Phoenix in 2002 from spending a few years in San Francisco I had reverse culture shock and needed badly to revert to what I loved most - bikes With geographic fortune on my side I wandered into the bike shop nearest my home and and was instantly relieved - I had just found my new second home Nearly every 'wrench' I've met there since Day 1 has given me the personal experience I had been searching for since a friend closed his shop before I moved away Admittedly I'm one of those people fanatic enough about bikes that I would share my bed with one and also currently have one of my most prized custom cruisers hanging on my wall as a mechanical piece of art (which I do pull down to ride frequently)and while I'm a very passionate bike owner I am a horrible mechanic - hence my need for Rage So when your garage shed and living room are filled with bikes ranging from grocery-getter cruisers custom built/painted top to bottom rigs downhill mountain and high end top dollar "all mountain" bikes AND you know from first hand experience that working on them yourself is the worst possible idea you need a shop like Rage that is filled with guys that not only know their shit but share that same passion I would 100% lay it on the line to vouch for every single person who works there to give you the bike shop experience you needeven if you're buying your first ever bike I heart Rage with good reason.
The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business Ever since moving to the new premises things have sucked I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
Sex In The City meets World of WarcraftThis dark sexy place is unlike most establishments you might find in the Scottsdale area which I not only appreciate but encourage It's a bit off the beaten path as the entrance is in the back and when you walk in your pupils will needs time to adjust in order to navigateThe wine selection was impressive and the hummus plate was perfect The staff was great When my best friend realized she really wasn't a fan of the wine we chose she was able to trade out for a different one with no difficulty or attitude whatsoeverThe DJ was spinning very relax-esque music with a little bit of funk It was a nice change of pace from the typical top 40 you'd hear elsewhere As the night progressed the beats got sexier and the songs more clever I was completely sold when he remixed Johnny Cash & some dub step Of course we didn't come out of there completely unscathed We had to visually endure a cougar (or two) throwing themselves all over their sugar daddies in a blatant gold-digging escapade for all to see But I guess that's the price you pay to party in ScottsdaleIt's a great bar and I would recommend it to anyone.
Amazing food and even better service We went here for my wife's birthday based on a deal we found on travelzoo The owner right away gave my wife a free drink worth $30 Throughout the rest of the night out waiter took extra special care of us My wife even went as far as letting him pick her dinner for her Every bit of the food we ordered was amazingly good and we could tell it was home cooked No chain food here I had one of the specials fresh fish from Hawaii and it never tasted so good The soups taste just like something my grandma would have made.
So they pretty much have every flavor Tea imaginable hot or cold Had their Chocolate Mint Hot Tea and my oh my it was Devine  Not your typical "tea shop" as it has more of a modern feel  Not too crowded for being a Saturday night but enough people to know its worth walking into  Cant wait to try their pomegranate tea.
AMAZING  Everything we ordered tasted beyond words  Really liked the Grilled Cheese my friend ordered  I would defiantly come here again and again and again.
Love this place  The food is spot on and the service is always perfect  I normally get the combo which has a beef enchilada beef tamale and a beef taco I have three words to describe it: FAB-U-LOUS The margaritas aren't bad either Oh Yeah The chips and salsa are awesome.
I love SideBar Yeah the drinks are expensive but I think you get what you pay for a decent high end bar in downtown phoenix Get the Whiskey Sour fantastic.
We love Sa Bai and have been coming here since they opened we are very lucky to have such a great place in our neighborhoodOur server always remembers us our drinks and what we usually order to eat  The food is fresh-fresh-fresh  Everything we have tried is excellent and they are very accomodating to special requestsWe heart Sa Bai and hope they thrive in our neighborhood for many years to come  We are so happy to support an excellent independent local restaurant.
I've only had the meatball sub and the italian sub but both of them knock the socks off the competition  If you've never been here you should just go and experience it for yourself.
Garlic stir fry with pork (medium or hot) is delicious Comes with steamed white rice and that's all you really need Get it to go and it comes in a bowl that you can dump the rice into and mix it all up One tasty tasty dinner here my friendsFriends have had the pad see ew with chicken and once with beef Pretty tasty A little sweeter than I personally would want it but the meat and noodles are cooked wellHad the Thai Toast Not a huge fan But I have never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to Just tasted a bit oily to me Deep fried a bit too much.
This location as all others I've been to have friendly cashiers long waits (since it's so popular and food is made fresh not like Panda Express)  I love the lettuce wraps soups crab puffs etc.
This is a great store and has been there for as long as i can remember  Yet it still always looks clean and fresh  The selection of products is off the Hook as they say   (They) the young generation   They absolutely have everything that you could imagine       Of course there is a drawback   The Price i t is very high priced shopping  but well worth it in a lot of ways Lots of parking and very friendly service AAt.
This place is gross They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty I don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon.
If you're tired of the same old Pizza Hut Papa John's Dominos pizza all the time give this place a try Owned and operated by one person so its clear he doesn't advertise well or have a website and the place has a bit of a dull look To be honest I've never dined in here I always take my order to go The place is empty most of the time and it's sad to see he's losing all the business solely because of lack of proper advertising That's the only reason I can think of because the food is excellent I go here at least once a week The cheese they use is spectacular and the gyro specialty pizza is a must try TRY IT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I hope this place thrives because honestly I'd hate to see it go Btw for those concerned their meat is Halal.
Our vehicle was broken into and the window was shattered along with some minor damage to the car door  We contacted our insurance company and were referred to Caliber Collision  The damage to the door was so minor that they just took care of it and we only had to replace our window which we had full coverage on  From the moment we walked in the door to the time we finished our business with Caliber Collision we couldn't have been more pleased  Thanks Caliber collision for your awesome service  We will definitely be back if the occasion ever arises  It's nice to have great customer service.
Accidentally walked in at 10 minutes before close and the amazing Amy welcomed us with open arms She and the rest of the staff made it feel like we were at home She was very knowledgeable with wine and the menu The food was delicious Try it.
great coffee and even better service  Love these guys.
I get serious cravings for this place I want it right now  I just wish it was closer and I would eat there so much moreWe used to go there a lot when I was in school It is the best pho I have ever had It is delicious and amazing I do not know how they do it It has so many great vegetables inside it and the broth is so aromatic I also left my wallet there one day I didnt realize it till 800 PM the NEXT day as I was leaving for the AIRPORT OMG I was freaking out I called and they were closing I was so scared I wouldnt be able to get on the plane I told them my situation and one of the employees stayed in his car till I got there 25 minutes later after they were closed He wouldnt even take a tip I had to throw the money in his car and leave It was so wonderful of them and I will never forget it I was able to get on the plane and it worked outI have nothing more to say about this place It has great food Its is super cheap It comes out fast Its healthy What more can you want Go there right now.
This hidden gem offers delicious food with an authentic Italian ambiance The menu is simple yet incredibly flavorful The ingredients are fresh and the wood fired pizza oven cooks everything to perfection.
An amazing unassuming little place - completely unexpected and didn't disappoint.
Great place Service is awesome Try the tacos- perfect Table side guacamole is the best Plate sizes are great for sharing Nice place for date night or meeting with a group of friends We are here on vacation Can not wait to return.
Best taco shop in town hands downI love everything I have hadHorchatta is amazing I would say they need to get a bigger placea little cramped at timesI am on the fence about this because it makes things seem more communial and neighborhoody I tell people at La Condesa all the time The owner recently told me happy hour everyday 3-6pm$300 naturalorganic margaritas.
I have been going here for a couple of months and love this place She always takes her time to make sure she does a great job Kathleen is so friendly and is like a psychologist and just listens to your stories and problems After she has completed her work she always asks if you are satisified and always offers to put on more lashes if you are not satisfied (which never happens) Her prices are amazing and I would not go anywhere else.
This place is the Pizzeria Bianco of the Phoenician Mexican food world -- excruciatingly long waits questionably overpriced occasionally brusque staff Unlike PB (which represents a wildly successful marketing coup) Los Dos is a wonderful little oasis in the armpit of South Phoenix My SO and I have been going for an embarrassing number of years (and accordingly the staff is super welcoming and we rarely wait) He occasionally demands a birthday dinner there Los Dos style -- they turn the lights off bang pots and pans scream their heads off and bring a festive dessertYes the food is hot Do you not know this when you go I mean you don't drive by this place on your way to the mall and think 'gee we should try that sometime' You are going to be in pain at both ends my friends but it's delicious Even their sour cream is special tweaked by the addition of subtle flavors of mysterious spicesThe margaritas may have grown weaker over the years or perhaps my liver has just ramped up to keep pace I've gotten falling down sloppy shitfaced here many a time The haters are just pissed off that the staff served their bratty attitudes right back to them instead of kissing their plump asses as they are so accustomed to and/or they are transferring their embarrassment about being pussies about the hot food Tough titty More for us.
Nestled behind most of the bustle from Scottsdale road just south of Camelback road a funky serene little spa has popped up to serve the skin and eye brows for the otherwise facially deprivedFull service facials eyebrows (as you might guess) massage and much more good prices great service all in a place that smells really good too.
Large Asian market in fact the best I have found in Arizona  Being originally from the bay area in California I miss some oriental foods I grew up with  I found most everything from my childhood here  It also has fresh produce and a variety of meats that I have experimented with  It also has other imports at this store and if you are looking for something "different" this market is the place to goAlso if you are craving BOBA drinks they have a small shop to the right as you enter.
I love this place just across the street from my work I go here alot The sandwich's here are AMAZING The only complaint is the wait and delivery time is LONGtry the white widow or tia stick.
Went to lunch here today Had the chicago dog with fries and a few bites of the steakburger (Not that I wouldnt have eaten more)The fries are awesome here I love the thin shoestring fries The dog was good it was on a great bun No complaints at allI had a few bites of the steakburger from my girlfriend She wouldnt let me eat it all HAHASo I was done eating and was like oh what the hell lets get the custard I tried the brownie delight= Delicious Very smooth and probably the best frozen "ice cream" I've ever tried I will be back and will make a special trip to try more stuff.
I beg to differ dude  Here on holiday and let's just say Chompie's is better than the average chipotle lovin brain boiling sad excuse for a seafood restaurant place in BFE (AZ)I've only been to this one location and from the taste of it it was one of a kind  The first time we went I got the latkes (yum best ones I've had that weren't home cookin) and the second time I went for the hot pastrami sandwich (so good)  The bread was a little soggy so if you go for it do it right and ask for the bread to be extra toasty  Overall good place  I wish we had a nice reasonably priced jewish deli where we lived.
Excellent food service and price   I was extremely pleased.
Great atmosphere inside but even better out  The food is always good though I believe the food and drink are a little over priced  Service has been hit or miss during our visits but generally okay.
We enjoyed a delicious dinner and great service  Its a beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere   The steaks don't compare with Mastros but the entire meal was incredible and we highly recommend it for a great meal.
Classy Organic Healthy delicous Everything is supeb and this is reflected in the HIGH prices Great place to go if you have 40 dollars each for dinner Best Organic restaurant I have ever been to Highly recomend the fire grilled salmon the palmagranite Lemonade the Tapas the Hummus the salads EVERYTHING IS GREAT.
Service was ok except from the inexperienced management Numerous complaints about the NFL games on the TV Even though the majority of the customers were there to watch a demographic specific team the manager refused to accomodate  the cries of the consumers to satisfy his own pallet  I know first hand how difficult it can be to set up a restaurants numerous game day programming but after a few months of walking the floor talking to people looking around at what type of crowd is showing up to spend money at your establishment you can get a pretty damn good idea of how to go about it It is a week by week decision that needs to be taken into account and not something that is pre-set 2 weeks in advance Shame on the inexperienced managers for not having a clue about the demographics interested in spending money here We should have walked out and gone elsewhere like a large handful of other customers.
Good lordIf you want to feel like an idiot just for just trying to figure out which packaging is best to use come here A pretentious lady who dresses like she's reliving the 80's will make you realize just how important customer service really is.
What  LOL this place is HELL  Back in my hometown of Chicago this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests togetherI had a taste for sushi it was on my way I peeked inside and thought to myself "This can't be as bad as it looks"  Oh yeah it can  Note to the owners:  no you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar  It's loud it's crowded I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish  It's cheap I'll give them that  But if I had to deal with this place again a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull.
Great unassuming business well worth seeking out  The proprietor used to run the famous Pyramid Brewery and he's put that fruity beer expertise to good use with his yummy watermelon wheatI'd go here again absolutely.
Yes This is what every fancy restaurant should be like The service was AMAZING From the waiter's sexy voice to the side dishes arriving at the same time and hand served by the staff Impressed Now that's getting what you pay for The food was delish I had the bone in steak the chef special "rubbed with 27 different spices" and yes he/she rubbed it well LOLFor desert we shared "Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake" this cake was pure insanity it came with hand whipped cream and fresh strawberriesI can't comment on price because my boss treated his staff to this glorious dinner I'm sure he would say it was well worth it :).
Probably my worst dining experience EVER  Went on Saturday evening had a lovely time drinking overpriced cocktails outside while enjoying the gorgeous setting  That is where any mention of a pleasurable experience ends  Once seated the service was dismal at best  Server took 15 mins to bring one glass of champagne even though we saw it sitting in the bar ready to be picked up for over 12 mins (the other members of my party were never even offered a refreshed cocktail the entirety of our stay)  Took another 15 mins for us to track down a different waiter so he could go find OUR waiter so we could order  Appetizers came fairly quickly and were just ok very disproportionate servings and not at all worth the prices  After our apps came another 30 mins passed before we finally flagged down the manager to find out 1) where our waiter was and 2) where the rest of our meal was  10 mins later the manager came back to tell us that the delay was due to our chicken  2 people in my party ordered the chicken - didn't realize they had to kill the chicken and prep it before cooking because I have never had to wait over 45 mins for chicken (15 mins while we ate our apps and another 30 mins eating our 2nd basket of bread)  Our waiter finally showed up acting completely aloof wondering why we were upset and then quickly disappeared again  Another 20 mins and still NO FOOD  We had had enough  We flagged down the manager to advise we'd be leaving  He tried to get us to stay and offered to pay for our meals  At that point he could have offered us meals for the next month for free and we would not have bitten  This was beyond horrible and honestly the one star I gave it was very generous  There is nothing anyone could do to ever make me return to this establishment with the staff they have working there  For what was supposed to be high end resort dining this was anything but  I've gotten much better service at Chili's Bar and Grill and that is just pathetic  The management and owners of Prado should be ashamed.
The bestperiod  Car Cleaners always does a fantastic job on my vehicles  Every service I have had performed on my vehicles has been top notch  This is the type of local business that is so easy to support they are awesome.
This restaurant really is the type of place where you feel at home It's run by a wonderful couple who make the food from scratch daily Try the lasagna if you're hungry it's fabulous.
Ok so they've been open for a while now The menu is slowly expanding but I thought I would add some comments about the food Wow Not typical pub food They have a quality menu Everything is fresh They don't even have a freezer in the buildingThe burgers compete with the best burgers at any specialty burger joint Delicious beef blend is my favorite but the chicken burger is surprisingly good and the black bean burger is an excellent option for those wanting to pretend its more healthyHouse made chips are a great side but no match for the duck fat fries The only problem is they're so rich you really can't eat a whole basket by yourself I'm not a dessert guy but the connoli nachos are out of this world Again so rich you have to shareThe wings are non-traditional drumsticks that are huge meat lollipops There's only 6 but there's a ton of meat on these babies and both sauce options BBQ and a sweet and spicy are outstanding I think a brew pub has to have both good beer (duh) AND good food -- and AZW delivers strong in both categories.
Best liquor store I have ever been to Every time I am in Tempe I make it a point to visit this place They have a huge selection of all kinds of liquor I come here for the beer Which has an incredible selection of brews I could spend hours here looking through their very huge selection of beers I love that you can buy single 12oz bottles instead of having to commit to a whole six pack.
i have eten at Sierra Bonita several times  The food is ALWAYS consistent and some of the best eating in Phoenix  The atmosphere is amazing and service is always top notch  SB has figured out how to be a great neighborhood restaurant with world class food  The style is southwestern with Mexico City influences - truly amazing.
No good At all Prices are awful 1 star for the piped wasabi.
Great wine great ambiance amazing music.
amazing haagon doz milkshake and awesome burgers i highly recommend this place.
Lovey love love this boutique Finally checked it out on a First Friday of all nights even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door The clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality so if I had an extra $90 lying around I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch I love the dresses but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession) However the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced around $100-150 and again very cut Men's clothes - not totally my taste a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch "I'm dressed up"But I can afford the jewelry and oh it is cute cute cute Picked up a five-piece simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah you heard me $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it The sis had seen one at UO or something for like $29 but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18 AND i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print Does that makes sense) ties ($30) In bright jewel tones like peacock blue hot pink and lime green with awesome prints like an octopus  or a bicycle Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit Very unique and incredibly stylish - and I'm a winner cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him Everybody winsI was going to give four stars but how cool is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt I'll tell you - very effin' cool Another star and BB is outta this world Ow.
I love this place so much that it's all I often think about since I moved to the bay area 4 years ago  Enough saidIf I ever move back to Arizona again it's because of Papago Brewing.
You guys in Phoenix are blessed to have such a good Pho place as such good prices Nowhere else I have been on the west coast has this quality quanity and service for this amount of money CHEAP and GOOD is allways hard to find Lots of Vietnamese customers in the place so it must be good Anyone know of a better place in Seattle San fran or LA I hope they don't get a swelled head because of yelp and charge to much I eat like a pig and the big bowl is way to big Spring rolls $225 for two and a small bowl $475  HAHA amazing Also pages of vienamese food I havent even heard of.
WOW oh WOW  talk about sevice and a view So speacle occasion this is the place to go  It's like everyone in the resturant knew us specipicly  The Food was great a little pricey but I did enjoy it all oh my the lava cke at the end was a great finish for two.
Ted's has the best hotdogs in Arizona bar noneThe line at lunch can be a little long but it is worth the wait  You can't go wrong with a jumbo all beef and an order of onion rings.
I've eaten here several times now and it's been very good every time  The selections are good as are the sauces  They cooked it very well everyone was very friendly and attentive and we were in & out in under 45 minutes The prices are higher than they were but I think for what you get it's reasonably priced - and draft beers were $2/$3 - can't beat that  This is the only one that I've been to but we will definitely go back.
Went in here for a quick lunch came out very satisfied A tender melt in the mouth medium rare sirloin really makes me can't wait to get back to this restaurant and their fresh clam chowder soup is perfection You can't get enough of it When you first walk into this restaurant you will notice the Wild Wild West mark everywhere surrounded with lots of antiques My fav is their personal made lantern that they put in every side of the ceiling It was lovely I definitely will be back for that steak and more.
we hired cameron to be our wedding dj from the first time we met him we knew he was the right dj for us he was chill but we knew he would keep the party on track he had tons of experience a reasonable pricing structure and a super friendly and helpful demeanor it turns out his schedule-keeping skills were mighty important on our wedding day the wedding ceremony was over an hour late because of rain and subsequent hail during the time we should have been exchanging our vows we flip flopped the cocktail hour and the ceremony to allow the rain to clear cameron played cocktail music told our guests to grab a cocktail and appetizers and as soon as the rain let up they'd get to see a wedding awesome i didn't have to worry about a thing except perhaps the rain letting up which it did but now back to this review i'm a last minute kind of girl even when it came to the wedding and cameron was not bothered by me a bit i called him 3 days before the wedding with my latest brilliant idea - a wedding video for my husband's grandmother who wouldn't be able to attend i was in luck - robbie the videographer was available and we added the video to our contract at a really fair price cameron knew my situation and he could have charged me double because at that point i believed i really needed a video but he did the fair and honest thing instead i like a business man with ethics continuing my theme of last minute decisions we were still selecting songs to play during the ceremony the day before the wedding asking questions and generally being a giant pain in the ass being the accommodating wedding dj that cameron is he took everything in stride helped us make the final decisions and never showed even an ounce of annoyance toward me if i were him i would have strangled me the music selection he had was extensive and fun and he was happy to add to his collection with a few off the wall selections we just had to have he rocked our party with energy and class until the venue made us leave and everyone had a great time 5 well deserved stars.
We went to Daily Dose on a Saturday June 23 about 10am  when we got there the line seemed endless but the hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait and she was right on We sat at the bar which was great service Food is amazing I had the chorizo eggs Benedict while my husband had the meat omelet with smoked Gouda both were amazingly tasty  have a mimosa make it a double and it's a perfect breakfast   Hostess also took the time to come talk and see how we were doing Really enjoyed it We will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner next time.
Nothing beats a #1 with grilled onions no tomatoes well done french fries and a pink lemonade I've been known to eat here twice to three times a week and find absolutely nothing wrong with thatThere's magic in those delicious burgers just one bite and you are instantly transported to a world of savory goodness unmatched anywhere else on this little blue marble we call Earth.
When the Gelato is actually made and served by a real Italian it just tastes better  This stuff is the real deal I would say that when I go there I feel that I'm transported to Venice and that I'm eating the Gelato in the home country but that would be an exaggeration  It's still darn good even though I'm stuck in Scottsdale  Ciao.
Very horrible experience just getting to and from the gameDespite leaving Peoria (18 miles away) an hour before gametime we were stuck in the traffic just trying to get off the freeway for this exit and with all the traffic didn't make it into our seats until the end of the second inning  (That's 80 minutes of travel in 18 minutes after 6 PM)  The cones they used to try and get us to the overflow dirt parking lot (NOT the center field lot this was down right field behind the Sox training fields) were trying to force too much traffic into too thin a lane and I ended up bouncing off a curb which showed many battle scars from cars in the pastAfter the game traffic was bad again but this time we were forced to take a right heading west on Camelback into the middle of nowhere with no signage or help to get back to the freeway  I may have an iPhone but I'd rather not have to try and get new directions while driving thank youOh and this was on a night of 3/4's capacityThe stadium itself is nice enough  There's not much shade in the day games and the grass berms in the outfield don't go up as high as in other newer parks  The grandstand seats are not sloped very highly though so if you sit behind a tall person you may have a lot of leaning to do to see the gameI would've given the stadium three-stars but the horrendous experience getting to the park and out make it a one  Save some time and money and go see some of the many other nice parks in Arizona.
Stop in every once in a while food is always good Street tacos  Drinks are reasonable Typical dos style Great place to hang out with your friends if you don't want to mess up your place.
What a shit heapThe sound is awful the food is awful and anything edible or potable is grossly overpriced even by venue standardsDespite the fact they have two huge projection screens you'll be lucky if they have one of them working much less bothAnd the tickets Dear lord the tickets If you've going to pack us like sardines into a 100+ degree venue without even the courtesy of breathing room lay off the ridiculous prices and magical feesThere are about a million possible venues in Arizona at which I'd rather see a show than Cricket and that includes a damp cardboard box on the corner of Van Buren.
Impressive every timeHave been back a few times since my last review  Visited yesterday and all is still excellent  Pizzas remain incredibly yummy service is fast and kind and it's an excellent choice when you have kids  The dough they give younglings to play with keeps them occupied and is a winner of an ideaWe had one boo-boo where the server mixed up my little girl's order  The manager immediately came out apologized and said it was on them  An occasional error happens and I told him that was nice to offer but not necessary  TIP: We ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake to share for dessert-- makes you want to say Hallelujah after each bite  The bill came and both my daughter's meal and the dessert were credited back  I made it up on the tip side but it was a forthright gesture that the place wants to nail the dining experience every time  NICE.
I was at church this Sunday morning when I had a craving for Pho I went on my yelp app and put it pho near South Phoenix About 4 miles away was Rice PaperIt's always scary to try something new but after checking out a few reviews I figured it was worth trying and I even brought 6 other friends who also loved it (some never had Vietnamese before)My order: - Traditional bowl of Pho                  - Pork Crispy Spring RollsMy friends ordered: Banh Mi (viet sandwiches) Here is the reviewPros: - Pho was tasty and cleaner than most Pho places           - Decor of the place was very chic           - There is a bar (for you drinkers)           - The banh mi were HUGE and came with garlic or sweet potato fries           - Nice outdoor patio for when its cooler outside           - The head server was very helpfulCons: - Price was a little more than most pho places (Pho: $10 / Rolls $350-$5)            - Spring rolls were pricey for one spring roll or two cut up fried pieces to make four            - Parking lot was smallabout 12 spaces            - The restaurant is about the size of a house so even though we had a group of 7 I don't know if i'd bring that big of a group next time            Conclusion: Check this place out It's intimate and I'm glad they're open later than most restaurants Pricey but hey sometimes you gotta pay to have something nicer.
Great coffee place Tasty drinks and great price Staff is always friendly and upbeat.
Douchebags Short skirts and crappy house musicPerfect for 20-30 year old range.
Although I am impressed with the herb store that is part of this establishment the restaurant leaves a lot to be desiredLet's start with the tables & chairs:  very tiny (like for children's tea parties) and rickety (although it adds to a sense of excitement and paranoia -- to compliment the sense of inferiority they attempt to engender with their "we will wait on you when we feel like it because we are more elightened about veganism than you" treatment)  A few of the items that interested my husband on the menu happened to be unavailable and apparently this is not ucommon at Chakra 4 according to some other reviews hereI ordered the watermelon gespacho (sp) which was very goodTheir bread / toast is another matter  It was very hard (think thin patio paver)  Although it was drenched in olive oil I broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off (I think I must have swallowed it) when biting into it  Since I didn't realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant  they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill  They have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food  I think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if I were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomach/bowels for the tooth chip and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their bread/toast versus that of my tooth which doesn't seem cost effective  At least I got my calcium when I swallowed my own tooth chip -- I literally got "my calcium"If you have any old stale bread that you are considering throwing out or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside by all means send it to Chakra 4 so they can then TOAST it then drizzle a little EVOO on it and serve it to their customers -- RECYCLE PEOPLE  But don't expect any sympathy or cooperation if you leave their restaurant with your smile looking like Wil-E-Coyote's after he accidentally missed the Roadrunner and instead bit down on an Acme metal plate.
My wife's tire popped a days ago and I was like great that's gonna be another 150 bucks to replace So I called them and asked how much is it to repair a tire and they said "if I can fix it it won't cost a thing" I was shocked So I brought it down and explained that I didn't have the money to buy a new so they gave me a used tire for free And told me to come on down when i get paid again to buy a new tire and im gonna do exactly that These people really care about they're customers and ensure the best service I found my new tire shop.
Great price great service The lady who cut my hair knew exactly what i was talking about even though i am horrible at explaining things I got the exact haircut i was looking for They give you a free soda with your haircutSWEET lol Its a nice mom and pop style barber shop which i love This is definitely now my haircut place for phoenixand its a really really good price straight edge razor shaves too those are awesome I only got the haircut service but i do believe they do full straight edge cuts shampoo and some other stuff check their website out for all that they offer Haircut is 14 dollars 2 dollars off if it's your first time thereThey also have a punch card which is cool when small mom and pop places do that They accept card but its a 34 cent charge so bring cash.
So good Lots of interesting flavors all natural ingredients very clean and spacious eating area and great customer service Will definitely go back.
Awesome food Very consistent and I am a sucker for the Satay green curry chicken and the pad Thai is smookin hot The place is not fancy And only seats about 12-15 They have a huge takeout business I have never been disappointed They know you by name and always know I am a diet pepsi guy and bring out the satay to start I dont have to even ask Give it a try your gonna get hooked Average plate is about 7-9 bucks.
This is one of my favorite new restaurants  I have been there 3 times now and everything I have ordered there has been really good  They have such a variety of great foods (pizza pasta sandwiches calzones etc) and very high quality  And I have never had an issue with their service  I even went once with a group of 22 people from work and they did a great job handling our enormous partyI can't wait to go back to try something else.
Came after reading reviews but this place charges you for bread and butter  They call it an appetizer  rip off.
Loved this place when it first opened Ate there several times a week Last time it looked  and tasted like cafeteria or airplane food Won't be returning.
We found everything to be wonderful  The brie platter for the appetizer was tasty and gone in short order  One of us ordered the fillet and the other the pork loin  Cooked perfectly and enough that we each took half home  The special tartes was pumpkinthere was none of that left over It was a great idea to use our groupon on Halloween nightonly a few tables through the entire meal  Server was attentive and chatted with us when we asked about their upcoming move in 2014.
With its finely appointed decor resembling a pub straight out of Dublin the Skeptical Chymist is a visual funhouse offering sanctuary to the pub-goer looking for something different A large chalkboard behind the bar lists a wide variety of handcrafted brews with alcohol contents ranging from five to the much higher ten percent range typically found in double IPA's I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings Their happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious But the piece de resistance is their corned beef and cabbage a true delight with its perfectly cooked cabbage and  generous portion of corned beef slathered in a mustard onion demi-glace Kudos to our server who was quick to forewarn how the dish comes with a 'gravy' for had she not done so I'm certain I would have been repulsed upon seeing my corned beef smothered in a brown gravy At first we were both confused our thoughts swimming around the idea of how gravy could add anything to corned beef But this gravy is different They call it gravy but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe accents the corned beef into a culinary triumphOne IPA and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn as Sundays are meant to beDuring the week the Chymist is a fun retreat from work with its all ages crowd cigar-friendly patio and extremely fair happy hour pricesThe Chymist is a great place to unwind or have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food  I should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service That's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment you'll likely disagree with this reviewOverall nice job SC management.
I LOVE this place I've been here numerous times over the last 7 years and it's great every time.
Went for a weekday lunch with the boyfriend because this place was so highly recommended by Matt S (who is  currently"The Duke" here on Yelp's new check-in app) We barely found this place because it's tucked into the corner of a strip mall right next to a pet groomer and a preschool/daycare Once we walked in we noticed that they have a covered patio as well as indoor dining The tables are covered in butchers block paper (and they gave markers to the tables with kids although none for me Hmmmm I am a kid at heart Note: I shall ask for markers next time) I ordered the Deli Sub (ham salami and peperoni adorned with veggies oils and mayo) #nom This sandwich was huge which was maybe my biggest complaint I literally could not smash the sandwich down enough to fit it in my mouth I had to pull a bit of the meat off which made me feel sad for those slices of delicious meaty goodness For my side I ordered the pasta salad which was good (maybe too many onions for my taste but still good) And for dessert I ordered a scoop of their homemade ice cream - brown sugar & cinnamon flavor Double #nom The service was great Our waitress was very attentive checking back on us several times throughout the meal The 2 other staff that were there at the time also pitched in by clearing plates which shows that they are a great time and they were laughing with each other which makes for a great atmosphere.
We love this venue  Its a little treasure in Cave Creek  Don't let the "Coffeehouse" sign fool you  They have a large selection of beer and wine  The patio is amazing too.
I've belonged to Costco since it was called Price Club This branch is my favorite store in the valley I couldn't live without the cheese bagels I buy gas from here exclusively because it's cheaper than anywhere else  The membership pays for itself and I have a free American Express card They recently put the slides of my childhood on DVD and did a beautiful job I love to walk the aisles and see what's on display: cookware dishes jewelry auto accessories baked goods wine fruit books clothes The holiday treats are better here than at any store in the valley  My favorites are  the chocolates of the world and the chocolate macadamia nuts  What makes this store so great are the people who work here I've been to several different stores but this one has the friendliest staff.
Yes-- really digging the art that's hung there-- such a cool little place.
Great food and friendly staff They have very good Vietnamese coffee I'll be going back soon.
I first heard about Community Tire and Auto because of an award they received from ASU WP Carey School of Business Although this location wasn't ideally convenient in terms of distance from my home I decided to try them Once I did which was several years ago I've never taken my vehicle anywhere else for the services they offer The big thing in my experience with Community Tire and Auto has been a sense of honesty and integritywhich are not qualities always associated with auto repair and maintenance shops In looking back I realized that there were at least 2-3 instances with my prior provider of choice (Sun Devil Auto) where I felt pressured to make repairs or conduct maintenance that was questionable and I should have gotten a second opinion Altogether the cost for those visits ran into the thousands of dollars  I have never felt that with Community Tire The pricing is fair They refer to manufacturer's guidelines for all maintenance recommendations And they occasionally have coupons which are always nice including a free oil change with your birthday I almost feel like Community Tire and Auto's service is a secret that needs to be shared so others can experience the peace of mind I have since discovering them myself.
Do you know why there are zero stars checked  BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS NOT OPEN ON THE WEEKENDSMy life plan:  "vacation" studying at new and exciting coffee shops and bars with the BDF (best drink friend which is not the same as bast food friend) while we work on the weekends  Two times I tried to go her and two times I was denied  I thought the closure was temporary the first time I went  It was Historic Homes tour day so I thought the private event was the reason it was closed on a saturday  But this weekend low and behold I still could not go  Closed  Every weekend  No people in the old town componenet of Mesa -- which it too bad because it has a kickass yarn store and tons of potentialWill add stars if my impending weekday visit really knowcks my socks off  A penalty for th no weekend service will remain.
I'm giving this place 1 star because I went to get my hair colored for the first time and the girl messed up on it so I had to go back the next day and get it bleached and colored again The color didn't exactly come out the way I wanted it too but it will do I'm just upset because after all that now I'll have to keep up with it so it don't turn orange and most likely I'll just have to cut my hair short to get the color out since it won't go back to my natural color after bleaching I'm so upset that my husband paid 150 for this.
I really hope this is not what China tastes like  There are corporate chains that have better food and THEY are horrible   You can tell the ingredients are of the lowest quality and cost the owner the absolute least amount  Plain and simple just another "don't care about quality" place in a busy strip mall.
Surprisingly the worst mexican food I've ever had Even other Macayo's are light years better Want some dry rice hot/bland spices and food that tastes like cardboard This is your placeMore like a bar than a restaurant.
So good came here last week finally with my wife and kids  Place is not what I would call kid friendly but I found myself wanting to drop my kids off at the McDonald's next door for a few hours jk (I don't want CPS coming to my house for that joke)  I had the FEZ burger which is just the most flavorful burger ever while being the most unique burger I have ever eaten  It had BBQ pearsand I cant remember but it was flipping awesome  It is very modern inside my wife loved her salad and our friend had a great tasting sandwich  Kids ate chicken fingers from the bar menu and some sliders from the appetizer menu  All was delish will come again and ditch the kids first (remember this is a joke).
Best cab EVER Larry and Sofeni (hope I spelled that ok) are wonderful I will never call any other cab service Clean nice cab courteous service Prompt Calls to confirm You have to use them You will be very satisfied.
First time ordering from Pizza Heaven I picked this place because of the yelp reviews Perhaps their regular crust pizza is great but this was by far the worst gluten-free pizza I've ever had(no exaggeration) The crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard I popped it into the oven to see if I could get e crust crispy but no luck I'm so disappointed.
We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St Mary's Basilica one of the oldest churches in Phoenix  From the outside it's an mission style stucco exterior while inside all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear  Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes  Considering the Church is downtown there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist  It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at.
The service here is not the problem nor is the the saturation of tv's (quite impressed with the fireplace screen) it's the bad food  How can you mess up nachos and pretzels They serve these appetizers with a bland cheese and the salsa is also bland  The calamari No comment at this point With all this bad food they also lack beers nothing more than your average domestics Maybe if the parking was better I would give you the second starDefinitely no baby making here :(.
i discovered this place about 6 years ago by accident and with a brief period in witch i lived out of state i`ve been going there frequently and i love all the menu items but the bread and the sausages are by far the best item  that item has become a must for all the family bbq  yes they sell them raw by the box for $45 and man o man they are good so if u want to try some real Eastern European food try this place and you won`t be disappointed  Can`t wait for next time when i will get lunch from them.
Overdue reviewUpset They would have received a higher rate but they've greatly dissapointed me We went in for Mother's day and was rudely told  to leave because they only allow those who have made reservations ahead of time My family has been going to their restaurant for quite awhile but to be treated that way was unacceptable They should have put a sign up or even just explain it nicely to us would have workedBottom line Will not be going backPOOR customer service.
OMG seriously the best Carne Asada burrito I have ever ordered at a neighborhood Mexican food drive thru style restaurant  The meat is tender and not fatty and the burrito is not greasy and heavy  The portions are more than enough  The breakfast burritos are also awesome  In all honesty a $400 breakfast burrito will feed my husband and I  So if you are not big eater you can definitely share.
Great first visit  I'll try again soon and we'll see if they can keep the 5 star rating  I have to say I'm loving this corner of Frank Lloyd and Via Linda - several great options (Anacala with Pars Tesoro etc)  I've avoided this place until now (2 yrs in the neighborhood) because it looks awful from the outside - like a sports bar or cheesy diner with those stark blue signs in the windows - whatever it looks like it does NOT look like the cosy place it is We sat outside on a 90+ evening it was 'just right' - without annoying dripping misters The live music from inside was actually great (not too loud not intrusive recognizable songs sung well - what I want from live music in a restaurant) Even though we sat outside the inside looked VERY inviting  we'll see how cold it is (main reason I sit outside is that inside restaurants are too cold in summer) The lobster queso appetizer was great (but too filling)  My partner had the salmon and she loved it I had a steak and it was more tender than I could have hoped for  can't quite explain that one but it was good  Both my partner and I were served a large chili stuffed with potato - it was truly outstandingWill definitely be back Only downside was that they allow smoking on the patio luckily this visit there was no wind so the smokers in the corner were not noticeable  but that will lose a star or two for sure if I end up next to a smoking table.
The Decor is NICE  staff was nice and attentive Food is amazing  This is one of my favorite Resturant .
Stephanie is amazing She is my go to person in Arizona Her skills and attention to detail amaze me On top of it she is very friendly and down to earth Very knowledgeable in her field Plus if you have ANY questions about application etc she is so helping at teaching and explaining I cannot stress enough how much I have enjoyed having Stephanie do my makeup I will definitely continue to use her every chance I get.
The first impression I got was a very welcoming one The sweet man at the front greeted us and was SO sweet and nice I liked how clean the restaurant is too I ordered the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend had the orange beef they were both delicious I went because this place was highly rated on here and I'm glad we did We will be returning very soon to try other things on their menu.
I've been to this adorable coffee shop probably 4-5 times now The owners are so friendly and cheerful and I love supporting a local business I'm a big fan of their chai tea and their chicken Caesar salad The baked items are delicious and everything is reasonably priced I'm craving another visit now just writing this.
Great nom noms in my tom toms I got the gyro It was loaded with meat and very delicious Not like some places where the meat is dry and lacking in flavor  One of the best gyros I've had Added plus its a small locally owned business and the owners are quite friendly.
This little shop is pure magic We sauntered in post dinner and had a fabulous finish to our meal The chocolate lava cake made me whimper and mewl The cake itself was a little piece of perfection and  the chocolate erupting from it truly amazing It was served with vanilla ice cream surrounded by a fine bed of chocolate crumbs We paired this with two bold red wines that really brought us to the apex of dessert heavenWe met Julia and are excited about her efforts to give the Ghana(ese) people a hand up It's a great mission to be able to change lives through chocolate We'll be watching her website due to be relaunched to see the progress of Julia Baker Confections.
We had a great experience at this Pita Jungle  We love the food and the atmosphere  We had great service and what an affordable Happy Hour from 3-5PM Monday -Friday  I really enjoyed the Pineapple Margarita's.
I will never see a movie any other way This place is going to put cinema supper club out of business Food:  From Tanza - excellent The trick is to get there 20 minutes early so you get your food early and you're not eating in the day  I've been here a few times now and I haven't any complaints  Even the wait-staff is incredibly friendly Alcohol:  There is an awesome wine dispenser How very 2012  But there's also a bar that serves to ipic - it's called "Salt"  I would like to recommend the el-corazon - unsalted 2 of those and I was ready to make out with my husband in the theater The seats:   It's so worth is to sit in the VIP seating Seats recline you get a pillow and super-soft blanket and UNLIMITED popcorn Really  I'm moving in Become a member and tuesdays are discount days Membership is FREE.
Fast friendly service and no charge for my first rotation and flat repair WOWED in Scottsdale.
I already wasted my time and money at Julio G's I don't want to waste more of my time reviewing them when one word describes them "NASTY".
This is a great little shop I went in for recommendations on a pool pump after having a less than great experience at another outfit (let's just say they rhyme with "schmezlies") These people really know how to take care of their customers Their staff showed me an assortment of options for my broken pool pump had reasonable prices on the best replacements and even went the extra mile to help fix other issues with my cleaning system Their pool tech (the guy who comes to install the equipment) was also knowledgeable and friendly and was patient to explain what was going on with the current and future setups Overall a great experience and now I can enjoy my pool the way it was meant to be enjoyed.
I'm a big fan of Fox restaurants already but Modern Steak did not disappoint The boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we had a great experienceIt was a Saturday night and I was surprised at how not busy it was We chose a nice table out on the patio because it was a warm evening Even though the patio is right next to the parking lot it's relatively covered so you still feel like you're in the restaurant and not just sitting in trafficWe both ordered filet mignon I was very happy to see the had grass-fed beef You don't see that too often and it's a much better choice than grain-fed so yay Modern Steak for offering that For our sides we ordered the mushrooms and the onion ringsThe steak was delish Done just right to each of our liking ad a nice-sized portion The onion rings were tasty served with BBQ sauce The mushrooms were a nice compliment to the steak My the end of our meal we were stuffed and satisfied When the boyfriend made reservations he mentioned it was my birthday so they brought out a free dessert A very nice touch for sureThe most impressive part of the night came at the end We both had steak left over so sent it back with the server to be boxed to go She came back to our table and told us my steak had accidentally been thrown out and offered to have a fresh steak cooked for us to take home I was blown away that they would offer that instead of just saying oops We of course took her up on the offer and enjoyed the leftovers the next dayHigh marks for the food service and atmosphere Modern Steak was the perfect choice for my birthday dinner.
I am in mourning for Fez Not that Fez has gone anywhere I've gone I realize that it's just a restaurant and that there are thousands of restaurants here in LA where I now live But Fez has never been just a restaurant to meFor my family and me Fez has been the kitchen that isn't in our house This is where we go when we need some comfort food and more importantly some comfort We can walk in any time day or night and be cuddled cared for and fed Thomas (the GM for those who don't know him) is a combination of dear friend and goofy brother (younger I guess but I'd never say that to him) Chad the world's most talented actor/waiter/dad always makes us feel wonderful Chad always makes us feel as if his day has improved just because we walk in the doorWhen it was time for the launch of my debut novel there was only one location under consideration - Fez When our anniversary came on the heels of a blown engine and serious crimp in finances we went to Fez for food libation and comfort And when it was time to leave the valley we ate our last dinner at Fez joined by a dozen good friends and hosted by Thomas and ChadSo here I sit in LA wondering if I'll ever find a place like that again I doubt it Fez is just the right mix of people place and food that makes it the rarest gem I'll just have to visit Phoenix from time to time for comfort And food.
Made an appointment online unfortunately I couldn't make it so my wife took our toyota highlander in for four new tires I called and they put the tires on hold for me no money down My appointment was for 3:30 My wife text me at 3:55 and said they were finished They didn't try to upswell her on warranties or more expensive tires She called me when she got home and said "you have to yelp this place" Normally I wouldn't have my wife do anything with car repair alone I was sure she was going to call and say they were out of the tires I reserved and all they had were more expensive onesnot here Thanks discount tires.
Just got back from lunch at Switch and I am SUPER happy I decided to go here for my birthday lunch I had the special that was going on veggie ravioli for only $795 I would definitely come back for this meal again It was delicious The flavor was so good and the meal didn't "weigh" me down like some ravioli dishes It was light and completely satisfyingTo my surprise my lovely boyfriend phoned in and ordered me a white sangria It was AMAZING I would for sure recommend this Try it you won't be disappointedAnother great surprise was that they brought me out a delicious chocolate chip cookie bake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle on top with a pair of Happy Birthday glasses and napkin The desert was to die for I unfortunately couldn't eat the whole thing but I did my best Thank you Switch for making my solo birthday lunch outing a very memorable experience.
I must say the freshness and and the taste of the pizza here is going to give bianco a run for his money We had 2 different pies but the clincher has the meats that hey use on there pies wow When I got the check it was almost half of bianco's price with out all the wait time I will be back.
Very nice people combined with a very nice selectionif you have any questions you can just ask and every one there is happy to help youThis store for sure is worth checking out.
coffee is great very friendly staf and great place to relax and drink a cup of coffee :-).
What's with long lines to get breakfast Very disappointing.
Been here twice Once for half price bottles of wine and pizza for happy hour And today got the Lobster Mac n cheese that I saw on the menu last time Too much for one sitting I guess I'll have awesome leftovers tomorrowoh darn.
Well the concept of this theater really appealed to me I still think the concept is great however thought in the execution seems to have been absentWe showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater This gave a a few minutes to look around The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review) We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theaterOnce we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seatingwe got to our seats got comfortable (more on that) experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated Once our server showed we ordered My wife wanted a white wine The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it We ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe My bet is they're not made on premises but charge as if they were After just eating at Tanzy I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same Menu was not greatat least the dessert menu with it's three options The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures Not long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty It took about 30 minutes before we saw our "server" again to ask for another pair The second pair was better but not much They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them wellComfort I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner Not There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1") that is an uncomfortable feeling as wellWhile the concept is fantastic the designers and operators really ignored the details If you build it they will come is not a good business model They may comeonce And once it will be We will not be back.
I am in love First of all I'm a taco connoisseur & a tequila lover so it wouldn't have taken much to please me However the corona & lime chicken tacos were excellent our server was knowledgeable about tequilas (& able to find something for my hyper-picky best friend to eat) & the margaritas were good enough that my generally thrifty friends ordered 3 eachI agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of primer on tequila for those who are less tequila-inclined but I will definitely be back.
I enjoy eating at Grotto Cafe several times a week I like the Iced Coffee Their salads are very tasty and always look so good i have tried the Monterey the Southwestern and their new Eggless Cesar Salad which is my new favoriteThe Grotto Cafe has great employees who work very hard to make their customers happy.
We'll definitely be back Very comfortable nice restaurant without being fancy There were two teenagers and three adults in our group and they seated us at one of their very large booths You could probably fit eight smaller people into one of them Good startWaitress was very nice and patient and happy to explain and recommend items We were all very happy with what we received We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Case Grande.
Being that I've only been on ONE ride i thought this one was good  This is way below my threshold of fun for the dollar but it was for my Grandmother's 80th's bday and she really wanted to do it  Overall this is one of the cheapest deals I've found  $130 per rider I believer  Total of 12 in a basket  Oh yeah 12 in a basket is ALOT  Our guide was funny he was really skilled (he split 2 hills) and was very accommodating when it came to telling us about the balloon and how everything workedChampagne cheese and crackers at the end  With your yelp check in a free champagne glass etched with Rainbow Ryders  Nice way to commemorate.
I really had an enjoyable dinner hereThe waiter/owner (I'm guessing) was awesome He was cracking jokes with us and was really fun  So what did we have Now he was the only guy running around in this little restaurant (maybe like 6 or 7 tables) so he was plenty busy Yet he was still pretty attentive of our table The guy was hilarious though definitely made the meal more enjoyableThis is what I remember having (it's has been about 3 weeks since my trip to Arizona):Inca Cola and the columbian pop as well I split half a can of each with my brother Not too bad both were kind of too sweet for meThe Tamale Sampler platter:a red green and Ecuadorian tamale The Ecuadorian tamale was really tasty The pork and vegetable combination in that tamale really went together well The others were Mexican style which I felt were good but readily available at other restaurantsThe Queen Arepa was delicious Definitely worth a tryThere was a shrimp dish that was kind of like a gumbo I wish I remembered what it was called Did not disappointLastly we had some sort of fish dish in a banana leaf I didn't really like the flavoring of the fish I guess it was just an odd mix of spices that I didn't find too appealing All in all a really awesome meal even though I wasn't a fan of the fish I would definitely go back whenever I'm in Phoenix.
Staff was more than helpfull I felt like it was a great value if you like great khans you will love this place way more of a variety food was delicious I wish there was one in san diego.
I placed a to-go order on a Tuesday night while barley anybody was there & waited 35 minutes to get my food  This was my first time eating their sushi so I was pretty excited and didn't care about the wait  Unfortunately the sushi was oddly warm and the tuna was slimy  For the price I paid (including a 10% gratuity fee for take-out) I expected way better  I felt sick for days even just thinking about how un-fresh the sushi and fish products were  I can't see myself going back just stick to RAor hell even Whole Foods sushi is delicious.
Just moved to this area and tried this place for the first time Lovely attentive staff and nice interior The food was amazing We had samosas chicken tikki masala curry shrimp and garlic naan I can't wait to go back and try more dishes A little pricey (never had to order rice seperately) but worth it.
Had breakfast here again today and had the special it was very good and a really great deal I really love the fish special they have here on Fridays it is really awesome and the price is just as good This place has really nice ambiance to it Adriana the owner is really nice and always greets me with a smile when I come here  All the waitresses here have been really friendly and attentive the service is really top notch.
Clean gorgeous place Fantastic wait staff AMAZING AUTHENTIC CUISINE So impressed Go go go.
Excellent lentils and brown rice :) Highly recommended.
AMAZING I've had a lot of bbq from Alabama to Georgia to California and in between and this place is right up there with the best of them I had the full slab of ribs one day with baked beans and then I had the 1/2 pound sandwich (half chicken and half pulled pork) Blown away :).
We've had slow service and not so great service before but nothing as bad as today  We were in the bar area for 9 minutes and nobody acknowledged us (there were 2 tables and about 6 guys drinking @ the bar) so we walked into the dining area thinking that would be better  We waited another 8 minutes2 waiters CLEARLY saw us and didn't say a word and had 2 small tables  Finally we got up to leave and my husband asked one of them why the service was so bad  His excuse was "we don't have a hostess today"  What does that matter   Then he asked to speak to a managerguess what   They have no manager either  The guy never apologized or took any responsibility  He only said "well I can wait on you now" We will never ever ever waste our money here again  Not when there are so many other pizza and wing places nearby.
Love their pizzaVery fresh Their cannoli was really good tooThey seem to have great selection of wines.
First of all - very clean nail salon without any overpowering smell I am a hair stylist by trade and so I am VERY particular about sanitation in salons This place seemed to follow all the rules to protect their guests Secondly the space is large and airy I felt very comfortable and relaxed in their massage spa chairs The nail techs are all very pleasant and do a very thorough job My tech Wendy was great She not only did a terrific job with the services she also turned me on to a great Vietnamese Restaurant.
Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners Drivins & Dives BIG MISTAKE Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting "Food Network" endorsement Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list apparently the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairscups & utensils we were in trouble One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant which was a complete zoo Now according to Triple D the pasta was homemadeaaaaaahnot so much Ive been to Italy I know the difference  Cut to the chase $2700 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entreesSeems to me his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat businessDon't waste your time and moneyOn a positive note Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.
I USE to love 1130 when the service and managers were courteous and nice The last trip to 1130 we double dated with new comers because we raved about the food and the service We have been here at least a half dozen times and ordered the salmon calamari steak salad mimosas happy hour beers/cocktails burgers All great until this past trip We go here so often I have bought gift certificates through restaurantscom that is $25 off a $50 bill of ALCOHOL+FOOD So using this certificate was no problem the first time we went the waiter checked with her manager before we even ordered to make sure it was alcohol+food Both said it was valid So I bring in another certificate a month later and it's a whole new story when the bill comes This waitress tells us we are not allowed to use it for our drinks only food Contradicting themselves from the month previous we used it Then the manager comes over and I explain to her the situation and they honored our certificate the month before no questions asked but she insisted in arguing with me for about ten minutes asking who the manager was whats their name and waitress' name who "approved" this the last time  After fighting with the he-she she said she will honor it this time but not the next time with a bad attitude and stormed off I have worked years in the food industry and you NEVER argue for any amount of time with the customer ESPECIALLY if you honored the certificate then change your tune the next visit I was humiliated in front of our friends we invited out and appalled that the manager had the balls to argue with me for ten minutes I have another certificate for 1130 and WILL BE THROWING IT OUT WE WILL NOT BE BACK and told all our friends/family what happened That is not how you conduct your business if you want to keep customers happy and spreading your praise  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.
BLD = Bo Loves  ummm Bo Loves Dis-Place :)I really do love this place I first heard of it thru Yelp but never had the chance to visit since it's far from the land of Scottsdale where I dwell  Finally made it and boy was I thrilled  I sat at the bar where Aaron was a great host and kept my drinks full  I ordered "The Goat Burger" -- Yummy  Oh serve me a sweet bite: goat cheese bacon roma tomatoes and arugula  Oh how it pleased my palates The burger was sweet and the scent of the arugula traveled thru my nostrils with delight  This was one good burger and I must recommend itThe place is like a lounge and with an awesome wine rack in the back  I totally dig the designs and the communal table in the middle  I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course Aaron which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man - Enjoy.
We had my grandmother go to Advanced Health Care of Scottsdale and learned that this is the most unprofessional place it's a complete joke They have no idea what they are doing they over medicate their patients and can't even keep track of their patients They beyond over medicated my grandmother She was completely out of it didn't remember anything was very aggressive was not her sweet loving self at all We continued to tell them that she isn't herself and something is wrong They completely ignored us continuously and even told us she has Alzheimer's No sorry you do not just get acute Alzheimer's in a week What a joke Come to find out that the doctor had prescribed her Valium talk about making a sane person crazy She was hallucinating out of her mind and they couldn't figure out it was the valium My family knew right away once we found out they were giving her valium They even had us hire a home health person to come in their facility and take care of her at night (basically do their job) So here we are paying all this money for extra care when they were the ones making her this way My aunt who is a doctor found out that she was on valium and told the head nurse as medical power of attorney for my grandmother she wanted the valium stopped immediately Did they stop it Nope They told her they did and then continued to give it to her You hope to have your loved ones in a place that they are being taken care of properly and this is not the place Overall this place is a complete joke and I would NEVER send another person I know there.
I LOVE TOTAL WINE I come here often when I need to stock up on my favorite kinds of liquor - the prices are pretty good and the selection is so vast that I always end up buying more than I wanted to Another good thing is that people don't give you dirty looks if they happen to see 3 or 4 or 5 bottles of alcohol in your hands :p In fact they might look at it as a good thing One thing I really like are mini bottles of alcohol that they have SO CUTE.
Koltton and his staff are AWESOME  The best facial I have ever experienced and the prices are amazing  It is perfect for those who choose not to spend enormous amounts of money at pricey Hotels and spas  Koltton is very professional and highly sincere  For a men's facial (which is about 1 hour long) you can expect to pay about $70 depending on how much your skin is in need of attention and the type of facial you choose  There are extras included one of which utilizes these heated pads prior to the massing of special oils into your aching feet and hands   Scalp massage and even a little reiki complete your facial-Heavenly  There are many other services offered and Koltton says he will wax anything  Okay  May I just point out the men's nose wax  Yes I know  Having hot wax placed up your nostrils and then yanked out sounds sort of UN fun but the results are incredible  No more itchy nose It takes just a few minutes and costs only $8  What a screamin' deal  It really does not hurt that bad  Now eyebrows are another thingOuch.
As much as I like Five Guys I just got home and there was no meat on my burger How can you be a burger place and forget the most basic necessity Very upset that they forgot to put the hamburger on to complete the burger Everything else is on the supposed hamburger lettuce onions tomatoes ketchup mayo But no meat.
This property just lost a customer and everybody we tell about our stay  Do not fall for the free breakfast bit  We booked through Priceline which indicates a free breakfast  We had a sub-par breakfast -which would have been fine if it were included  However we were charged almost $3000 for two  When we told the front desk Priceline indicates the breakfast was free they referred us to the small print  I asked "what can you do for us"  The reply was "nothing"  Small print or no small print a property that is unwilling to comp a breakfast to save a customer - when they certainly have the ability to do so - is not going to get my business  What was supposed to be a short one-night getaway for a weary mom and dad of young children ended on a very sour note.
My favorite car wash A million times better than Danny's Fam Car Wash (which I hate btw)  They don't try to sell me a new windshield that I don't need they don't try to upsell on detailing or anything I can inquire myself They always do a great job and I have a huge SUV that is a pain to clean SUVs are a little more expensive to wash than cars (which I'm not disagreeing with it makes sense -- just an FYI) You can also get a yearly pass that is a huge discount to the one-off washes My entire family washes our cars here and will never go anywhere else.
Probably the most painless easiest and quickest car fix I've ever had All the reviews of this place are correct: the service is great and they get it done without making you sign away your first born child  No extras or addonsAmazingly convenient if you live downtown as there is a DASH stop across the street.
Avoid this corrupt company terrible I sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeekingThey did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned the bill would be about $40000I said no bought $1800 brake pads from another company and did the repair myself in about an hourWhen I looked at the rotors they were LIKE GLASS in immaculate condition absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement  (the vehicle is only a few years old with low mileage) They completely tried to take advantage of my wife fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck they should be shut down You've been warned.
I have used All Pro Window Tint for 2 cars and now the house  David is always right on time and does an excellent job  I have always been 100% satisfied  He is never pushy and will give you honest information  The car and house looks great  I recommend him to anyone.
WOW  So Happy Portillos open in AZ A real food place Best dogs Beefs fries you name it It's all so good Read some other negative post about Portillos just a hand fullTo those people you have No idea what good Food is Sorry you really don't This foods so fresh n made on the fly fresh Not in Warner's as I read LOL PLEASE Go to Portillos n I Promise you will never go to any other fast food place Unless you really don't know Great food DA PORTILLOS  DA BEARS PORTILLOS YOU ROCK My Dad took me there back in the 1967 til present I'm a Fan This place is run Awwwwsum n Fast Why is it packed  BECAUSE ITS SOOOO GOOD HELLO .
Coming from New York i needed a place like this Ny has like 5-6 tier 0 Nike accounts and from what i hear this is the ONLY one in AZ  If you like quickstrikes and limiteds this is the place staff is not overly friendly but the kid that looks like Pharell is nice but coming from NY most tier 0 store employees are jerks so it's expected Highly recommend this place the mark up isn't bad at all with a wide range of brands though I myself am a Nikehead.
I wish I couldn't even give it one star my husband and I went in there for a quick bite before going grocery shopping We went to the counter we were not greeted for one two they all looked at both my husband and I like we don't belong in here because of our skin color and two they all spoke spanish not one drop of English I'm sorry but if you are going to work in a fast food restaurant in America you better start speaking our language I will never go to this one EVER again.
First of all if there is any indication that this place might be busy turn around and find a new place to eat It's not unusual for the wait for your food to be up to 2hrsWe ordered a salad and a sandwich to go and waited over an hour for it The salad came out within 15 minutes but the sandwich took so long that by the time I was ready to eat my salad it was a wilted slimy mess The owner was not helpful at all and we asked her to check on our ticket she just said "Yeah it's up there" This place has a small kitchen and when there is a large crowd it is just possible or them to keep up with the demand Crappy service high prices and a flaw in organization has lost them a customer.
Went to eat in by myself at lunch  Tried the panko chicken with tonkatsu sauce  YUM  Mama san stopped by and drop off the real verison of asian tonkatsu sauce  WOW  It was much better  BYW - tonkatsu = japanese BBQ sauce  Can not wait to go back soon.
I was here for lunch and I tried the gipsy soup It was really good: hot creamy tastefull My hubby ate Ahi tuna salad which was very nice presented and very good and my friend choose a salmon sandwich with sweet potatoes which was very good as well ( the bread especially was really good)I love the atmosphere their decorations ( the lady bathroom is so glam ) and the location I definitely will come back.
Went last night (9-17-11) for my first time and can't stop thinking about how impressed I am with both the service and the food A super cool concept atmosphere and menu Our waiter (Kevin who is actually one of the 3 owners) was awesome and extremely personable He suggested the redberry rapture for a drink and it was spectacular (and under 100 calories) We got to talking about vodka and he spoke of a brand I had never heard before and within minutes he brought both my hubby and I a sample of the vodka he was talking about The gesture was great and so was the vodka We started with the pretzel bread delishespecially the tomato dipping jam I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my hubby got a 1/2 of the loaded Mac and Cheese The buffalo wrap was really good and the Mac and Cheese was hands down the best I have ever had I am not a big meat fan so I would probably get it "naked" next time but holy cow was it good A 1/2 order is fine for an average sized meal All in all amazing experience I loved the concept of "owners at your service"the three owners were the waiters from 7-9pm and all of their tips went to charity Awesome I will be back.
This place is so good The sicilian sandwiches are amazing The sesame bread is great Can't go wrong.
Went to the salon at the beauty institute for a hair cut yesterday and loved it I don't even think that supercuts can beat this price ($9 for a woman's wash cut and dry) but the environment is that of a place I would pay $30-40 for a cut The student who cut my hair did a great job and her supervisor came to check up periodically Both were wonderful I will definitely go back.
I'm pretty sure this is the best pizza I have ever had  We split the bruschetta plank which was good nothing spectacular and the garlic pizza  The crust was cooked perfectly thin and had delicious flavor  The ambiance was very nice as well.
The Fish Market has been here awhile and it is still going strongFor the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city I adore their clam chowder (white) and just about everything else on the menu That have a fantastic fish selection with several fresh catches to choose from The scallops are wonderful and the shrimp is sooooo freshThe staff is super friendly The manager let my daughters pet the lobsters (in fact he invited them to do so)Two thumbs up.
It was a pleasant surprise to find that they serve local and organic foods  I ordered the organic grass fed burger and It was great cooked perfect and the service was wonderful  I don't normally order desert but when I saw they had bread pudding I said what the heck  It was by far the best bread pudding I've ever had and I will definitely be back to have it again.
Met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day  Waited 5~10mins seated at table for my girlfriend to show up  The whole time ignored by the waitresses  Finally my girlfriend shows up we order our food arrives with no utensils on the table for us to eat with  I had to practically shout down the waitress to bring us table settingsAll this would not have made me give this eatery a one star    the thing that really ticked me off was my girlfriend wanted to have shrimp in her dish  Paid $2 extra on top of a $695 lunch special  That's a 25% surcharge  The dish comes and I look for the shrimp    THREE that's right THREE measly little shrimps  Those shrimps better have been organically raised and human fed for the price they chargedI complained to the waitress  Instead of taking the $2 off of our bill she tells us she would take 5% off of the total bill which amounted to $060Wow that's a big deal    notThen she comes back and tells me that she can't do the % discount because the computer won't let her do that during lunch only during dinner  Really  What kind of BS is she feeding meHint:  if you are working as a waitress be honest and bend over backwards for your customers because they are the ones paying you not the $250/hr you get paid from the restaurantI was so mad over the whole incident that I actually did not tip my waitress and I usu am a generous tipperNeedless to say Thai House has lost a couple of customers over $2  Really $2 for 3 shrimps  Haven't they heard that times are bad and people want to feel like they are getting some value for their hard earned dollarAnd please don't feed me some BS about the computer can only discount a bill during dinnerTWO THUMBS DOWN.
There are way to many amazing places to go to Bandera  When calling in to make a reservation I was informed "they don't do that" when asked what their corkage fee was  The place had a normal busy Saturday night crowd but it seemed there staff was not trained for that  We had multiple servers where we had to ask for menu's silverware drinks & plates At one point even stopping a cookThe food was ehh and no I would not go back  Because like I said before there are way to many amazing places in the valley to go here.
A+ thanks so much for the quick service and new iPhone 4 screen   You make it seem so easy   I am already letting everyone know that you are the place to be.
Thank you Thank you Thank you  My bassett hound got out of my yard down the street from taco bell and they were very nice to take my business card and let me know if he by chance would show up theregot home after going through the window and sans de bassett patron saint of speed bumps was wandering up the drive way into my yardcalled taco bell to thank them for caring  And I got a sweet burro to boot.
This place has become a regular date night spot for me and my husband  It has some of the best sushi I have ever tasted by far my favorite dining location in Westgate  For lunch and dinner they have a variety of sushi options cooked and uncooked along with a delicious selection of entrees and appetizersIf you like lobster the Lotus Roll is a must try.
This was the worst one I've ever been to The service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door No one greeted us or even acknowledged us It took awhile for our waitress to pay any attention to us and I had 2 kids with me I will never again go to this waffle house The only reason it gets a star is because I had to.
It's an interesting mix of opinions posted about Chino Bandito Frankly on my first visit I wasn't sure what to think On my next visit I was hooked  Whenever I find myself near the 17 and Greenway I'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-outChino Bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says It's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside But look past it and you'll have some fun Even though it's kind of funky I did find it to be clean - and I'm extremely finicky about cleanlinessSome of the menu winners include the #13 Pollo Diablo which delights with garlic and hot peppers Besides that the #10 Emerald Chicken has a wonderful flavoring including ginger that is well-teamed with the jerk fried rice Enjoy the hot sauce and interesting mix of flavors  I also like the chocolate volcano which is only available on certain daysYes it is an odd mix of Mexican Chinese and Caribbean flavors but it works Chino Bandito is VERY inexpensive and highly recommended Just keep an open mind.
Can I live here please I've loved FLW since I was in like 5th grade or something and went on a school field trip and thought that wherever we were (some FLW building in Phoenix I rack my brain trying to remember) was the coolest thing I'd ever seen  I've been to Taliesin West quite a few times kinda want to go again  I think I want to live there.
I was stunned by the quality of the veal chop with apple glaze  Tender flavorful cooked perfectly and beautifully presented with wild rice and arranged asparagus  House wines by the glass were a good accompaniment  The Tiramisu was one of the best I've had  Service was attentive and sitting outside on the patio on a warm fall evening made for nice ambiance  Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75 so a good value as well  My best meal on this trip--wish we had a Italian restaurant like this close to home.
Worst customer service EVER Thank god I spend my 10k somewhere else Glad they only got $250 out of us for my ring  Could not care less that we were customers.
My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary I let him choose the restaurant because I hadn't gotten him a gift and he did take me to the Josh Groban concert and dinner 3 nights before I was initially disappointed because I am not fish person unless it is shellfish even though we had eaten here before and enjoyed it  My disappointment went right out the window the moment we were seated  They had asked when I made the reservations if it were a special occasion and I told them it was our anniversary There was an anniversary card on the table with fresh rose petals strewn over the cloth A real class act but it gets even better We both had the Maine lobster and shrimp bisque - very smooth and rich in flavor My husband had the Chilean Sea Bass which may make me say I really do like fish other than shellfish Cooked to perfection generous portion and mild with a little crunch on the outside I had the Jumbo white Gulf shrimp with Jonas crab meat which is where my problem came in because my palate does not tolerate pepper heat and generally I will ask even when something looks innocuous on the menu I have had meals at other places where they decide to finish the dish with red pepper flakes and have ruined my whole meal since it is not mentioned anywhere  Someone who likes heat would have loved it When the waiter asked what we thought I mentioned that I had made a big mistake and did I miss something on the menu Apparently it had some kind of chili oil on it  I was not expecting anything my bad but the next thing we knew the manager came over  He offered to recook the meal without the oil but I had already eaten 3 shrimp and told him it was my bad they could just wrap it and my hubby would eat the leftovers Instead he said he would comp us a round of drinks  Again class act In addition to the entrees we ordered two small sides to split (plenty) We had spinach sauteed with garlic and Parmesan cheese plus the crab fried rice with scallions and mushrooms  The rice was out of this world and the leftovers came home with the shrimpThey gave us a choice of complimentary dessert to share and we choose the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream  I quickly took my half of the ice cream before my husband took it all  The cake was absolutely decadent oozing rich chocolate  It needed the ice cream to cut it so I am glad I took my 1/2 right awayAgain all in all great food and excellent customer service  More places should follow this example  The impression they left with us made me immediately say "I am going to yelp them and give them a 5"  Kudos to you Wildfish.
I've been on a French kick lately  I spent last summer in France and am longing to experience it again  Checked this place out the other day and was really impressed  Authentic French food that is done almost as if you are in France which is a rarity to find here in the states let me tell you  I will definitely be coming back here on a regular basis and highly recommend it.
This place is amazing Great trainers and an awesome community feel I can't imagine working out anywhere else.
The food here is ridiculously good  Every single item was amazingWe went here on a Sunday after a visit to a downtown church and apparently we are the only people who immediately felt after prayer that what we need on a mid-day on Sunday are some cocktails and some amazing food  No one was there at all  Well the owners were there :)Nobou has a smaller menu at lunch and we ended up ordering three entrees even though we were full with two because we just had to try more - it was just so goodThey used their own homegrown purple basil in several of the drinks and dishes and because I raved about it so much they cut me some and sent me home with a big bunch of basil  How nice is thatI wondered how a place could have such a high rating with 103 reviews - really that many people loved it  Yep  Now I see why  Wish I was downtown more  Also wish more places had non-brunch Sunday food  Cause I like myself a cocktail and a nice lunch on Sundays :).
Great eats at this joint New York strip was awesome Pear salad was bomb and service was superb I'll be back march 10th.
Unhappy cold food Half the time there is unfriendly clerk charging different pricing Cheese did not even melt on rolled tacos and the guacamole is on the right side so you can't pick them up Apparently every one is left handed 2-3 years and still can't get their act together What a shame.
This is an unassuming small business that is a little out of the way and hidden in a shopping center but definitely worth visiting  I found it on yelp and tried it out on a whim when I saw the positive feedback  My family in the Philippines owns various restaurants in Manila so when I traveled there we ate - a lot  This it the first restaurant I have found in the Valley where you can get lumpia pancit chicken adobo (and various dishes that are more authentic than I tend to eat) and a yummy version of halo halo with ube ice cream  The people here are very nice the restaurant was extremely accommodating and clean   They even stayed open 2 hours later for us when we hosted a karaoke event here  We loved the boba drinks and for those who were too timid to try the Filipino dishes they have an American menu (burgers/fries/corndogs)   They have karaoke on Fridays with a great song selection - in English  Come here for casual and inexpensive eats that are authentic and tasty.
Dolby Atmos In all reality this is a typical movie theatre like all the other Harkins in the valley However there is one thing that separates this theatre from all the other theaters Not only does this one have a Cine Capri but it is a Cine Capri with Dolby Atmos If you aren't familiar with Dolby Atmos and how it enhances a movie then I suggest you allow yourself a true audio experience.
Came here because Cooperstown was closed Got a seat quick sat for 20 minutes and not 1 damn waitress with 2 or 3 walking around came to our table We just got up and left For a place supposedly owned by a former Phoenix Sun it lacks to impress would rate it no stars if I could.
Fresh food.
We went back to Crudo for another visit this time to try the food Oh My God Run don't walk to have a meal there Incredible The boyfriend and I each did the 3 items for $35 and between tasting each others' plates we were absolutely thrilled and stuffed I can't wait to go back again.
I almost wasted $260 on an unneeded tire I brought in my car to fix a flat it had a nail in it After waiting almost an hour they told me it was unrepairable and tried to get me to buy a new tire They were originally purchased at Fletcher's so I brought it there instead hoping it was under warrantee To my surprise they fixed the flat with no problem and I was on my way in 30 minutes didn't have to spend a penny Sham on you discount for trying to take advantage of a lady.
The best burger in Phoenix  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious  Ever since ordering the haystack straws I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order  That's a good thing by the way  And in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off yes I will confirm it in all sincerity smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet.
Still my fav wine bar I just dont get it wrong when I suggest Postino to anyone they love it as much as I do Tonight I noticed the crowd seemed a bit older and the bruschetta wasnt sliced real mouth friendly but that is okay your still high in my book Postino:-).
Well I never Lived Here But I got a really nice look at the place when I tracked my stolen iPhone To an apartment there  You have to love the find my iPhone app You could see it was in one specific section of the apartments The police was nice enough to come out and knock on the doors However most of the people who live there simply turn off the lights and didn't answer the door  It's that kind of friendly place So here's what you do if you want to live with people who will steal somebody's iPhone from a clothing store Changing room Definitely move there.
Had the same issue with the 45 minute prior check-in  I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no  Their computers had already siezed up is what we were told a security measurefederal rules to be exact  Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thingSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment yet it was fine on the arrival  So he had to pay  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds 1 pound over and gave them grief  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons  I don't blame her 1 pound over really  They don't know what customer satisfaction is I'll stick with Southwest and Allegiant thanks .
Citrine has become my latest beauty obsession  The staff are friendly knowledgeable and helpful without being pushy  I have slowly started to phase out my former makeup products as I run out of things (you have got to try the mascara) I highly recommend this little gem at UNION at The Biltmore.
This is one of Scottsdale's treasures  The concept is refreshing - they incorporate fresh local ingredients as best as they can This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go backI like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg But I do  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks try the pork and duck pateAt one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong  Save room for dessert A personal favorite is the butterscotch puddingYou'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew  They're surprisingly goodOne tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation.
Food is average subs if you're looking for that kind of thing but their register does math wrong and overcharges Rang up $24 for a $1999 family meal Employees are idiots and said that was tax 20% tax I think notShady business practicewon't be back.
I typically visit this McDonald's and am a regular due to the Playland my daughter and the Arizona heat As of late they have been completely lacking in the Customer Service end My latest visit left me quite displeased I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready my frys were  missing After pointing out the issue I had to wait an additional 5 minutes I got over it big deal But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me At this point I am shocked and appauled I decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology Avoid this place if you can help it.
Since using Coury's Auto for the first time I have yet to use another auto repair shop I have recommended them to several of my girlfriends (because a trustworthy shop is hard to find) They have all thanked me for pointing them in the right direction I wish I was closer but I'll still make the drive It's worth it for peace of mind.
I'm not interested in writing a review on the food If you don't know what a Chick-Fil-A has or if you don't know about the quality of this fine chain then go read my other reviews under the list "Chick Fil A" This one stands out from all the others I've dined in once and it was a great experience but the team that works at the Drive Thru window gets a five star review from meSometimes I get to the window and my food isn't ready but the attendant is always so cheery friendly and kind They politely ask me to park my car in the lot and then when my food is ready they bring it out to meOnce I waited a few minutes and to thank me for my patience they brought out a small Coke for me Even though I typically drink diet I am very appreciative of the kind gesture This location really cares about their customers having a great experienceKudos Chick Fil A on 87th street.
AMAZING The bread is fresh the sauces homemade and the meat is sliced for your orderWe came in for sandwiches only and left after dessert with a loaf of pumpernickel for the house My girlfriend fell in love with the Boston Cream cake and vows to try each of the dozen plus pastries they make The owners were really sweet and chatted us up while we ate No questions needed we will be back to this place SOON.
I waited in a long line and when finally at the checkout the clerk said my merchandise was mismarked and she was charging me what the computer said I asked in three different ways for her to honor what the tag said and she just repeated what higher price she expected me to pay I left my entire order at the checkout and will never go back I buy a lot of clothes for my kids at Gap and this was my first time going to a Gap Outlet store  This particular store lacked friendliness customer service and truth in advertising  In retrospect I also feel a bit disgusted that their clearance items are actually more expensive than the 50% off of full price items and felt the whole store was a low quality trinket-filled cluster  My overall opinion of Gap in general is tainted.
QQ Grill closed it's doors two months ago.
I love love love this store Other than an actual Farmer's Market I can't find a better deal on fresh produce The also have an extensive health supplement sectionStaff is _always_ cheerful and helpful and having this kind of store open until 10 every night ROCKSTheir specials can be very good and change weekly For instance one month they were offering discounts on ALL gluten free foods (well tagged) which was very helpful to someone like me who experiments with my diet Another week the had 25% off ALL supplements (I went nuts on Udo's and Raw Vitamin products)Note: They normally offer a monthly flyer and a weekly flyer On Wednesdays the previous week AND the current week specials are vaildI'm not sure what other people are complaining about regarding prices I meticulously keep a database of the products I buy where I buy them and how much they cost Other than a few bulk items I buy at Costco (and of course Farmer's markets) these are the lowest I've foundThat being said I can't always find what I want at Farmer's markets and since I shop for only one I don't require bulk foods so much.
My husband and I LOVE this place  The food is amazing the service is great and the prices are reasonable  Every time someone comes into town to visit we take them to Dick's and every person we've taken there have loved it  Highly recommend.
I have had chicken I have had waffles And now I've had chicken AND waffles Prior to today I didn't realize the distinction Prior to today I never had cause to consider the combination Prior to today I didn't realize what I was missingNow let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters It's not a place for any pretentious behavior The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name OK And that's what you're going to get In abundanceCheap as hell I had the #1 also known as KK's Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas thigh and mutant leg All battered and fried to perfection Two waffles the size of Vermont A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side OK I could have done without the last part But hey when in a chicken & waffle placeI'm still full I won't eat dinner tonight I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-oldDamn.
Coconut shrimp are awesome scallop potatoes great Steaks are great too Salads too Large portions Great ambiance like a classy mountain lodge Great staff I was impressed all of the food coming out of the open grill kitchen looked awesome.
Apologize to LDM for the mindless review from Lee Chance aka Lee FLee has issues with me calling him out as a hack while attacking a competing business and Lee C has now taken his vendetta to hacking on my reviews of reputable establishments such as LDM   LDM is  a premier New Mexican Cuisine establishment that can and will stand up to the most discerning tastebuds.
Very nice people where warm and you had a welcome feeling  The Paster is young and very nice.
As soon as I walked into this place my mouth began to water  The aroma in here just cant be beatI ordered the special - 1 16" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions  I lamented this topping combo but it was what my girlfriend wanted  I got the wings hot also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it outWhen I opened the wing box the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house  The next time I am in the area I will try it outI took the pizza home and cracked open the box  The mushrooms were thick and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand  The sauce was rich and the crust was perfectThe calzones were great as well smothered in marinara sauceThe price was great the people were friendly  The lunch special can't be beat  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda 50 cent refills)Negotiate the construction outside find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza  My only regret was that I had to share it  Next time - its all mine.
The subs are fantastic and fresh Great shop and great customer service My husband and I go all the time We are life long customersMy favorite is the Torpedo and my husbands favorite is the Smokey Southwest MmmmmdeliciousI would strongly recommend trying Planet Sub for yourself.

I used to play on a Coed indoor soccer team that was sponsered by this bar and that is when I started to go here If you are into authentic Irish bars then you absolutely must stop in It is in a kind of hidden corner but once you walk in you will realize how charming it is Even the bartender is actually Irish They have $3 Carlsberg all day every day and other great Irish beers and ciders on tap As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was delicious We stopped in last Saturday night because they are the only Official US Soccer bar in Arizona and we wanted to watch the game We were pleasantly surprised with the live music they had that night It was really great and I think we will be going more often now.
If you're itching for cheap down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare this is your stopTaco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s I mean who can resist those crunchy tacos So delish It is especially good after a wild night out I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when you're intoxicated and you go to bed you'll feel pretty damn good in the AM It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy Silly wabbit.
We ate out on the patio last night The weather was gorgeous the band was terrific and the food was delicious In my previous review I forgot to mention their margaritas They are my favorite margs in town They are expensive but I love the fresh lime juice I had the special which was grouper fish with asparagus and mashed potatoes It was very flavorful and nicely prepared My friend ordered seafood tacos.
They are located in the Pizza Hut complex off broadway west of mill ave.
This was my first time to Yogurt Jungle I was very impressed My wife and I went there to try it out it just opened two days ago What I liked the most about this place was being a self serve yogurt store they actually tell there prices (39 cents an ounce) I have been to other self serve yogurt stores that its becomes a surprise at the end how much your yogurt isThey had 10 different flavors: Original TartPomegranateStrawberryGreen TeaRaspberry ( no sugar)Orange SorbetVanillaChocolateNew York Cheesecake PistachioWith over 60 toppings including candy fresh fruit dry cereal all types of syrups and much more I would highly recommended Yogurt Jungle My wife and I both had yogurts with all the fixings with a ice cold fuji water ( $100) for about $ 800 and my wife still had yogurt left Very clean location kid friendly had a counter low enough for kids to see the toppings Over all great experience the owner even introduced himself and was very friendly Being a small business owner I am always trying to support local business owners that offer a great product with great customer service at a reasonable priceThanks Yogurt Jungle for the great first experience we will return.
First experience with thai food and it was an amazing one At first sight of the restaurant (outside) I had not been impressed once inside that changed We were greeted and seated immediately  We were not rushed to order and the waitress had a great deal of patience with me as I questioned her about everything The food was delicious but must say the thai iced tea was my favorite thing that night Extremely fair prices and large portions.
Fantastic Pizza Their cheese is great toppings are good and they have some interesting and tasty combinations (gourmet slices) All fairly priced and the staff are incredibly friendly The calzones are also tasty (and quite large) with a very nice garlicy dough/crust They have some incredible-looking deserts which I have yet to try Overall if you are a fan of mom 'n pop style new york pizza you will enjoy this place.
I used to train in this dojo as a teenager a couple of years ago Ray Hughes Sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the Martial Arts community Both Hughes Sensei and Tyler Sensei are incredible with kids they keep their attention make the classes fun but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves The programs are not only for children but for all ages including adults In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself Basic class setup: Starts of with stretching cardio basically a quick warmup Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment meditation is to help calm your mind) Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing hand placement and momentum) Towards the end there might be sparing drills (safety first all students are required to wear padding for arms legs and a mouth guard) Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body The main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs Great clean facility Near the Ice Den so plenty of parking Located in a safe area Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety Clean cold water fountain Air conditioned fans to circulate air Well lit Spacious locker rooms clean bathrooms Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes No contracts just a monthly payment if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn then it is well worth the money.
If you love authentic Italian food in a festive holiday atmosphere La Stalla is the restaurant to try They have an extensive wine list and they give  you enough  wine  to enjoy the evening We were a party of 8 on a Friday night and the service was superb The wait staff were helpful friendly and efficient My minestrone soup was warm and delicious  The grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage  I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage La Stalla stole my heart My group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli These dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented  The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday.
This just opened and I had never been into a Hi-Health so I was amazed at all the Nurtrition/Supplements that are available The staff was great at answering all my questions  - 5/5 stars I was also very impressed with how knowledeable the staff was - and patient with me in my quest to find a healthy way to loose weight --- just a few pounds I promiseGreat idea putting this right next to our local grocery store area Will make it very convenient to use in the future.
Cafe Laguna is a great place to go for a delicious mexican fix  The Indian tacos are my absolute favorite  I always order the grilled chicken Indian taco  The chicken is tender and moist the vegetables are fresh your choice of beans  It is absolutely mouthwatering  We moved to Tucson recently and everytime we visit Mesa we make a stop and Cafe Laguna  We've even made trips to Mesa just to get an Indian taco (honestly they are THAT good)  they aren't your typical tacos the frybread adds a new twist to the traditional taco that just makes you feel like you died and gone to flavor heaven  It's chewy texture added with the crisp lettuce tender meat and spicy pico de gallo makes an absolutely perfect combination  If you haven't tried it make it a priority on your bucket list trust me you will go back  I hear everyone posting how it is like Chipotle this place blows Chipotle out of the water  Good luck and good eats.
I have been on Phoenix for over 30 years  I always loved Bill Johnson's In the last few years they have gone to hell in a hand basket    Their beef ribs were very large with huge chunks of meet on them  Tender and full of flavor  They have been cutting back and back   I went last night for ribs  They were burned black and hard no flavor   I mentioned that the entire menu has no lighter fare on it  The new menu still does  The waitresses are not carrying 67 guns  (Too expensive) not  The condiments have disappeared from the tables  I I am sure the veges are from cans  They surely need a make over  Back to good BBQ lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways  Otherwise go chew and old retread.
Great animal hospital that is great with animals but they also have affordable no interest payment plans  As you know taking care of animals can be costly and most clinics don't provide this service to customers  As someone who worked in the pet industry and knows how the Banfield's of the world operate and charge I would highly recommend this hospital.
Keep on walkingMy friend and I each tried different dishes and shared  He got nice roast and I got a hamburger  The place is really niceopen brightbut the food is just a BIG disappointment  A hamburger + 2 good beers was $37   Expect to pay a lot for your food hereBoth dishes were poorsorry really wanted to like this one.
This was my hope for a  good get away and it did nothing for me  Just to take the kids out and enjoy a day near the waterService was fine being seated inside with pretty girls  It's a big dated but it's better to sit outside for sure for more room  Waitresses were nice but very slow  Tea refills per few and far between and food was not worth the money  Food did come in a timely fashionOnion Rings were very bland and simple and would not order them againNacho's with pork and beans on them was not even close to very good  The best thing on the chips was the real cheese sour cream and jalapeno'sBlue Cheese Burger was just par  Nothing to write home about unless it's on YelpI won't be going back especially since I paid $600 to get into the part to eatI hope the owners and managers read Yelp  I would hope you would try to spice things up more  People want a place to go and have a decent food ice cream for the kids and alcohol for all the others  This could be a killer location and place but I have been very spoiled by Antelope Marina at Lake Powell.
It's always perfect  Great Staff Great Management Great Food.
We have been here now several times  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to  The food and service is absolutely the best   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen  Everything off the grill is awesomeThe servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experienceSince we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:For one if you don't mind spending the money the toro "tour" is great  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro  From real fatty to a little less  Melts in your mouth  The presentation is very impressive  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabiAll there other sushis are served perfectly preparedThe steak is excellent  The flavor is spectacular  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked always and without fail exactly to you specificationAll tempura dishes are greatGrilled zucchini Very good and juicySeabass with miso  Cooked perfectlyI suggest you order to share and sit at the counter  It makes for a very good experience  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost  Just go for it tske your time and experience it all  It will make for a very good experienceTry their very unique drinks they are very refreshingOr if you are real daring the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience  Did it once  It's a bit long for us and wont do it again.
In September 2008 I went to a pastry cooking class hereIt was at nighttime  55$ a person  from 6-9pmWe show up and the pastry chef was the pastry chef from Cowboy CiaoOMG IwassoexcitedI'm such a huge fan of the pastries at Cowboy Ciao since they're unique and weird and awesomeOk so the class was super fun  We had like five or six different recipes  We broke off into groups and each picked the recipe we wanted to makeWe made them with the help of the chefIt was fun we were all talking  They provide wine and iced tea and water to drinkThen OF COURSE  Once they're all done YOU EAT AND EAT AND EAT until you can eat no moreAwesomenessI really had a great time  Really.
So good The bowls of pho are huge and served up quick Service is top notch and this place stays busy The peanut sauce that comes with the spring rolls is the best.
Love the Lobster enchiladas not on the menu special item usually Saturdays The flan is excellent Family run business very friendly people Recipes have been handed down for generations.
This is definitely on my Top 10 Places to Go for Lunch list if I had such a list They call if American fare with a Moroccan flair and it worksI've tried a few items from the menu and always enjoyed the salads and kisras A few friends are big fans of the bleu cheese burger However my hands down favorite is the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich - grilled chicken with mixed greens pomegranate vinaigrette goat cheese sliced pears and dried cherries on a ciabatta roll It's got this blend of sweet tangy and creamy going on that makes me crave it Definitely get a basket of fries - one is enough for 2-3 people to share There are four different flavors and if it's not too busy they will let you do half and half with two types of fries I like them all and usually let whoever I'm with choose the flavors Funny thing is that I'm not much of a french fry person but I probably like these because you don't need any ketchup on themThey have a very impressive wine list and I've heard good things about their happy hour and brunch Will have to try those soon (been saying that for about two years now of course)Service is usually pretty friendly prompt and accommodating If you ask them for suggestions they're knowledgeable enough to explain the different flavors and they're not afraid to tell you which ones are their favorites.
Delicious swordfish tacos and magical patio area  Love riding bikes here and especially love the complimentary chocolate chip and sea salt cookies  Another Arcadia gem.
Great salad buffet The blueberry muffins are always good and hot Too expensive for just salad though Awesome service Warm cookies are a nice touch.
The passion tea is awesome:).
Had a wonderful time and it's a great environment The margarita pizza was out of this world and the old fashions were mixed perfectlyI had left my phone there a few hours before closing Our wonderful waiter and an additional waitress (I'm so very sorry I can't remember your names ): ) found it called my sister we drove from Surprise back to Phoenix and they stayed a little late for me to come and pick it upTHE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING You both have wonderful hearts.
Taliesin West represents perhaps the best tour I've been on in my life  Dwayne the guide was animated passionate informative and gave us more than 90 minutes of facts stories and intrigue about FLW and the amazing space the Taliesin West representsBased on my experience I could not recommend anything but the 90 minute tour  If you've driven our there pay the extra few dollars (which supports good work philosophy and learning) and indulge your mindThey feature several discounts for the 60 and 90 minutes tours including those for seniors and active militaryBe forewarned a large portion of the tour features the outside elements and on a cold and rainy day it can be a bit of a burden without proper clothes and an umbrella  Even moving inside can be a challenge due to FLW's insistence on using canvas sheets for the roof  Kick ass stuff.
This placeOh MyWell if you're a vegetarianRUN I got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there Let me say how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got therehmmlets check for lardI asked the waitress who was going aroundslowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on (I'm thinking understaffedhoping) Anyway I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon What Yes Bacon So there went the idea of a burrito a tostada Depressing I ended up eating the very "ehh" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips) I'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect I will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.
I went into this store several years ago when it first opened and remembered it being okay  So when I decided to sell a wedding/engagement ring set I thought I would come here first for a quote  When I walked in I noticed they have completely remodeled it and it looks something between a check cashing store a jewelry store and a goodwill  An older man who was walking behind one of the booths saw me and decided it wouldn't be too much of a bother to help me  (basically he seemed totally put out)  I had a box and some international money as well in my hand  The first thing he says is "We don't do money here"  So I was immediately put off and said I'd go ahead and leave  He kind of backtracked and stumbled on his words and told me he'd look at what I had (Which is a 1ct solitaire diamond ring and 2 14k bands)  So reluctantly I gave them to him to look at  After some kind of joke method he said he'd offer me $200 for all 3 $200 I asked him why he thought that was reasonable and that the diamond alone is worth 10 times that  He said he didn't include the diamond (whatever that means what the hell did he think I was there for) and that there is a more complicated process for that but I could expect a "little" increase in value  A little I then pulled out an appraisal for the diamond alone from 1991 stating a value of $2400 and told him to have a terrible day  Oh and this guy's tag said something like "Store Manager in Training"So basically if you want to get a joke of an offer (JOKE) and/or totally ripped off and robbedthis is your place  Meanwhile I'll search for a more reputable dealer.
Loved this place during my visit to Arizona all I can say is STETSON SALADYUMMY.
Ive been twice now and keep forgetting to add my two cents  Had fairly low expectations as you don't hear much about Verona Chophouse and I've lived in the area for about 20 years  I am always leery about "upscale" casino restaurants as most are really hit and miss - especially those in Vegas with celebrity chefs' names attached to them  Our first trip was well beyond our expectations starting with a salad that appeared to be plucked from someone's garden to the perfectly cooked and seasoned filet  The service was perfect but a little odd in a good way  We expected a refined and polished server with a side of arrogance typical for a joint like this and what we got was a "motherly" type woman who was not only attentive and knowledgeable but also caring and went out of her way to make us comfortable with a bit of a dry sense of humor  What a nice change of pace Second trip demonstrated that the first wasn't a fluke  I opted for the Veal Chop and my wife the Filet  This time the Filet was unimpressive and a little smallish and perhaps overdone but the Veal Chop was outstanding  It was huge and so well-prepared that I had a hard time feeling sorry for my wife's sub-standard cut of beef  Thankfully it was big enough for us to share and we both left satisfied  The service was again fantastic and we were taken care of by another woman who valued delivering real service and comfort over playing the stereotypical server role  This trip we noticed the doors to the beautiful outdoor patio were open and a band of some sort was getting ready to play  Sidenote: We originally chose the Chophouse because Shula's at another casino just a few miles away was booked  It is really hard for us to find value in Shula's after dining at Verona Chophouse  Sure Shula's can be great but by my estimation you will pay about 30-40% more there and you could still get an average meal and crappy service  AND there is no way in hell Shula's could make a Veal Chop as good as Verona.
Always packed - Always great food Sometimes the service can be iffy but that is because they are so busy Once you get your order in the food comes out fast and it is amazing.
Love  Love Love this place.
Me and my lady friend went here for dinner last night We were a little underdressed but no one seemed to mind We were promptly greeted and seated Even though this was our first time dinning here the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars The food was amazing The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara The salads were average but good and the entrees really stood out I had the Veal Marsala which was off the charts After 35 years these guys know how to cook veal It was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth The lady had the salmon which was parmesean crusted and very good It was mild and wonderful The tiramisu for dessert was also great Next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt I have to give that a try The ambiance was great I don't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974 It's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time It does seem like it attracts an older generation but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves I can not wait to go back.
Great food and drinks This place has a great atmosphere for any occasion The guacamole is off the heezy.
We were on our way to lunch to another restaurant when we noticed the banner about TM My husband could eat mexican food seven days a week so we decided to give it a try  They opened at the beginning of November so they still have Alex Padilla as their Executive Chef  We were so happy we had the opportunity to meet him and talk to him for a few minutes  This place has been completely remodeled I didn't even realize until a few minutes later that this is where Roy's used to be  I loved the decor simple classy  The decorative doors are really cool  We started with a couple of margaritas  My husband had the Taberna and I had the classic  They were both excellent  I was not very hungry so I decided to have the Jicama salad  It was not only beautiful but also delicious and refreshing  Loved the texture combination  My husband had the tortilla soup and the beef tacos  I am not a soup person but I found myself going back to my husbands soup 4 or 5 times more  Every bite was a little different one time some corn another the melted cheese at the bottom  The presentation is really beautiful a miniature cast iron pot with the lid to the side very clever  The soup is not the broth base type maybe that is why I liked it  I only eat chicken soup when I am sick  This is more of a tomato base and creamier  The beef tacos are made with filet mignon I took a bite and it was delicious  I thought I was going to be good today but then we had a couple of desserts in front of us  I couldn't resist I loooooove Tres Leches cake so when I saw it in front of me I was in love  It was perfect the texture the milky/condensed milk oozing from the soft spongy cake  I had more than what I should have  I will have to go on the treadmill a couple of extra hours this week  I also had the flan this is the Mexico City style with cream cheese which makes it a little denser  It was truly delicious but I am still partial to Tres Leches I think this might be the best one I have had in the past six years  I'll post some pictures of the dishes we had soon  they were too pretty not to picture themI am so happy this place is in Scottsdale  I love Phoenix and its cuisine however I have too many friends who are not adventurous enough to stray away from their area  I will definitely come back sometime soon and enjoy a drink by the fireplace  Really cool place.
If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave It has to be this one  Why  Because here they get your drink out in literally 2min or less  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks but my God you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times If you want fast friendly and awesome service this place kicks all kinds of ass :).
I have been to Beckett's Table many times in their years of existence Each time is as great as the previousMy most recent visit was during the peak of the Holiday 2013 season and seven of us showed up on a Friday night (after having called ahead to several other restaurants and being told that the wait time was 90+ minutes) Upon our arrival we discovered that the restaurant was packed as usual but even though we didn't have a reservation they could seat us on their outdoor patio in 5-10 minutes Initially we were hesitant to sit on the patio in mid-December but it ended up being very pleasantly warm since the space was enclosed and had outdoor heatersIn my many visits to Beckett's Table I early on inadvertently complimented the owner on their service and delicious chocolate truffle dessert (no longer offered) From that moment every time since I came in and she saw me she would magically procure the truffles from the kitchen even though they were longer listed on the menu This time we warmly greeted each other and exchanged holiday pleasantries But alas they no longer kept the truffles even as special treats I mentioned that our group of seven was a reunion of sorts and that our little group included a New York foodie Well after consuming a delicious appetizer/entrée meal (of which the foodie raved) the wait staff brought us a sample of all the desserts (in a trough no less) compliments of the owner We were stunned and grateful (maybe ordering a lot of wine and padding our bill had something to do with it) So once again my experience at Beckett's Table proved to be a wonderful culinary experience with the personal attention from the owner that adds that specialness to each dining experience there.
My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30) and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app  We were seated outside which was lovely and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic)  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup and the Italian flatbread  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta but almost everything else was spot on  Yes we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was idealGreat service great ambiance and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which consequently has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle)  All in all it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees.
Very good my parents favorite spot Owner is great and friendly cute environment.
This Starbucks is clean The employees are friendly The manager Janora is fantastic I liked it so much here I wanted to work here and got hired.
Cockroaches and poor service confirmed it was the last time I went there I loved this place The crispy chicken lunch was one of my favorite dishes around But then everything changed on Monday 09/30 I'll give you my chain of events that has me adding this place on to my blacklisted restaurants list:I ordered the usual crispy chicken and paid to go 10 minutes later the hostess comes up and says "Sorry we dont have that dish you have to pick something else" I scanned the menu again and went with the BBQ pork dish which is the same priceAnother 10 minutes go by and I still havent seen my order What I did see was a giant cockroach on the white faux alligator-skinned  booth seating It started scrambling around and my coworker knocked it to the ground while it was chasing him I immediately inform the hostess of the situation while pointing to the cockroach she smiles and says "oh we just sprayed this morning" and walks away without clearing the cockroach 37 minutes after walking in through the door we get our order without an apology for the entire experience 37 minutes after walking in the door I decided I would never step foot in this awful place again The icing on the cake for me was that the BBQ pork was awful and undercookedStay away.
Visited Vincent's today with a local resident Ate breakfast out on the patio It was delightful They were willing to make an omelet for me that wasn't on the menu Very impressive and I would go back Service was outstanding.
Not so good Not clean Try Siam thai Much better and clean.
I have used Jon on several occasionsfor personal photosIve been very happy wirh his work.
I went here for a business trip and never wanted to leave It was clean relaxing beautiful Everything I could ever ask for from a hotel.
It's actually called 'La Piccola Cucina' and it is wonderful They have awesome food set up like a deli or you can order a panini The food is very fresh and they also have fantastic gelato- the only gelato counter I know of in DT Phoenix The atmosphere is so cool It feels like a mediterranean sidewalk cafe - umbrellas fountains flowers etc They are barely open a month so the hours will be expanding I know they are closed on Monday and they close all other nights at 8pm but the owner plans to stay open until midnight in the coming months The only downside right now is no beer or wine but the owner is working on that too.
Definitely one of our favorite good eats in town The magical cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries with their special dipping sauce is extremely addictive When we go with a group we always ask for extra dipping sauce so it is enough to share among everyone One basket is enough to share among three-four peopleFEZ kisra is very flavorful Lots of fresh and flavorful topping one of my hubby's favorite on the menu FEZ burger is a good one when you want a safe option to try out their food if you are a little less adventurous The field salad that comes with it is fresh and tasty too My favorite dish is the Crisp Pomegranate Chicken The sweet flavor of pomegranate dressing and the tender chicken breasts are beautifully complimented by the veggie and fruits that are placed below the chicken A surprise item was the breakfast kisra It was actually surprisingly good even my father in-law did not mind it He has always been a simple cheeseburger kind of guy but has really enjoyed all the food he had tried hereWe yet to try their desserts mainly because by the time we are done with the fries and the main course there was no more room seriously their portion is well worth the moneyThe only one thing I did not really care for was the FEZ lettuce wraps It was cold and a little too sweet and fruity for me But again I don't really like overly sweet foodI don't drink alcohol but a few times my hubby and friends tried a few of their signature drinks and really really loved them The list of a few favs: honeydew melon key lime pie apricosmo and pomtini I did enjoy the virgin mojito here FEZ is one of the few places I can actually order thatSeriously take yourself out there now and give it a try Treat yourself with a basket of cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries and try out one of their dishes your taste buds will thank you for itAlso I rate their services to be outstanding compared to most of the restaurants at this price range.
They claim to have the best carne asada in town I believe them All I had was a carne asada burrito so this 5-star review is based on a single item.
I really like the food at Grimaldi's and the service in the dining area has always been excellent However service in the bar area is disappointing at best It's a regular spot for me and my clients simply due to location But I'm not sure I will frequent it again After repeatedly receiving horrible service I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated The past 3 times I was there the bartender girls ignored me I was seated at the bar with clients I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink Not once did she ask- " Would you like another drink" Also I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water tooWhat really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business We are great tippers I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded Do the bartenders there not realize this I'll never go there again Either management needs to step up their game and train these girls properly or risk losing regular customers.
The white pizza with breaded eggplant added is amazing  Lunch deals are wonderful too  Always a fun place to go.
Horrible Pharmacy Expect to be waiting at least 30min to wait for an auto re fill prescription Costumer service is non existent I am going to avoid this location from now on.
I can also vouch for this incredible veterinarian office they saved the life of my cat and my dog who had parvo  The price to service ratio is incredible  Not sure if Dr Jimmy Alexander is still there but he was the best  most comforting veterinarian  I would never take my pets anywhere else.
This place is a total disaster I ended up moving to a new apartment on Easter so I took my friends to Mill Ave for some eats and drinks after we finished moving Saw Blondies with their "2-for-1 IPA" sign on the sidewalk and stupidly decided to try itWe walked in and were not greeted until we're halfway inside the big restaurant Pretty blonde in cheerleader costume finally told us to sit anywhere We asked about the patio but were told there's not enough room for six there We pushed two tables together and sat down inside The cheerleader was nice enough to tell us that she'd put on any game we wanted on the big TVsAfter five minutes the cheerleader came back and took our drink orders - three beers and three sodas We waited ten minutes for the beers to arrive and they're in cheesy little plastic cups in contrast to the pint glasses I can see guys drinking from at the bar Whatever Ten more minutes go by until the sodas arrived The cheerleader never bothered to ask us after twenty minutes if we'd actually like to order some foodWe asked for a manager but there was none on duty Granted it was Easter but if you're going to be open shouldn't there be some kind of management Anyway we told the bartender at the patio our problems She comped us the sodas and one of the beers We paid for the two IPAs and went across the intersection to Gordon Biersch where we received superior service and drank better beerBlondies Never ever again.
This place is really clean inviting and comfortable My wife and I came here for a weekend staycation I have a local business nearby and I will be recommending te Staybridge for my customers from out of town.
I am new to Arizona and I absolutely love Sprouts Having a place like that makes the transition of moving to Mesa AZ from Seattle WA a lot easier for me.
South Mountain Park is awesome Great hiking and mountain bike trails I've hiked just about every marked trail and many that aren'tHidden Valley (Fat Man's Pass) is probably the most interesting as a nice diversion off the National Trail In the winter I hike quite a bit in the western part of the park and rarely see people which can be nice if you are looking for quietTelegraph Pass is a favorite from the south while the Central Avenue or 24th street locations are most popular from the North The busiest parking lot and a great place to people watch as well is the entrance from 48th street to the east.
This is my favorite restaurant in tempe MUST TRIES- Italian Cornish Pasty (new:) )- chocolate bread buddingThis is literally one of the best restaurants i have ever been to and it is so cute and small and the staff is sooooo friendly Please try this place i guarantee you will love it.
What a great little find I highly recommend this place The food is amazing portions small (perfect size) Great atmosphere and service Highlights bone marrow cucumber salad w/ smoked salmon and for a cocktail the strawberry basil lemonade  Can't wait to come back when we visit AZ again.
Worst location ever I just moved around the corner from this particular TB and am very unsatisfied with the service The people are relatively nice but the speed of service sucks It always takes at least 15 minutes to get your food in the drive thru and it is usually ice cold once I drive the 3 minutes to my house(edited below 4/23/13)The other issue I have i that every time I have visited this location they get my order wrong Not just a little wrong completely wrong Today the store manager came to try and help the incompetent employee mess up my order I decided it was time to speak up She never said sorry acted offended that I was giving her negative feedback about her store and proceeded to talk down and mock my concern  I was so upset that I banged on the window and demanded my money back I drove 15 minuted to the next closest TB NEVER AGAIN.
my boyfriend and i have eaten this menu up and down multiple times- we can't get enoughfirst of all: BEST HUMMUS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE i always get it i cant help myself it so good its like a compulsionservice is spotty can take a long time some servers are better than others but the food itself is worth it so we go back time and againall salads= fabulous pastas= fabulous every single kind of burger= amazing all fries = better than you can imaginethis place is my favorite lunch place in phoenix to date.
Oil change was complete in a surprising 10 minutes the staff was very professional and courteous the waiting room was tidy and well air-conditioned and they gave my car a thorough vacuum and window wash  They did run through their usual upsell drill but I have never had any oil change or car repair done where whoever it was at Jiffy Lube or not didn't put me through the upsell drill  They honored my $13 off coupon (got mine in the mail)  This particular Jiffy Lube is a newer location and feels more clean and inviting as a result  Also the location seemed less busy than others (or perhaps I just got lucky on timing)  I'd recommend this location.
I'm here often - usually for coffee  So while I recognize I've got a little 'local bias' in me I have no problem noting things I don't loveLiberty Market is a just a great joint  It really deserves credit for planting the first flag in the name of the blossoming downtown Gilbert foodie movement  My kids used to tell me they liked going to Liberty because their bathrooms were awesome  They're right of course but the food is pretty good too  :)To the coffee   Like many others I am sure I can rate my liveliness (if not likeability) each day on a scale of  'BC / AC' - Before Coffee / After Coffee  Liberty definitely has the best coffee bar in the area - and their stock brew is Portland's Stumptown  You can't go wrong with any of the coffee bar choices but the Ca Phe (Vietnamese) and Cortadito / Cortado (Cuban micro) are favorites as is the simple French Press  Liberty always has a super assortment of pastries to choose from should thy tooth be feeling sweeter than thy coffee  They do a great job of keeping some favorites while always adding new treats to try  I don't have a big sweet tooth but I've enjoyed the innovative griddled bread pudding and like their bisuity scones - especially vanilla with coffee  My kids go bonkers for the Salt River Bars  The pizza is on par overall with Grimaldi's which the only pizza@chain I really love  I'd rate them pretty equally because Liberty has more specialty choices  To me the crust at Liberty (and Grimaldi's) is spot-on perfect and they use fresh mozzarella to boot  The perfect pizza crust should be chewy with a crunchy crusty tooth  Also you shouldn't have to wait 5-10 mintues for an inch thick of liquid hot magma cheese to cool before you dig in and then later wonder whether you'll be able to digest it - which is a problem with typical pizza place pizza  A real pizza is spectacular right out of the fiery burning furnace and thrown on your table  That first 5-10 (10 is pushing it) is the window when a pizza is more than just a 'pizza'   It becomes more and more mundane after 5 minutes  Don't Yelp-punch me if you're from the Midwest and are screaming about Lou Malnati's or the like  That is a savory pie  It can be very delicious  But it isn't pizza  Hey I didn't make the Rules della Pizza  Naples didThe sandwiches at Liberty are very good  My favorites are the Farmer Press and the Turkey Brie  However the cold-case sides feel 'hit or miss' in my opinion (since Liberty has high standards)  My advice is to find one you like and keep going back to that well  The burgers are outstanding although I only eat a couple a year  Liberty always has some really creative specialty burgers that are worth checking out if you are a carnivoreThe fish dinners especially the specials are worth their price  Gourmet restaurant quality with great sides (I can never get enough cauliflower mash) and special saucesI used to have some gripes about Liberty breakfast - not that it was bad just that you had few alternatives to biscuits and greasy potatoes  I think the Liberty Potatoes have way too much cheese but I'm sure some may disagree  It used to bug me you could not get eggs made to order - but they appear to have changed that policy  In fact I had over-easy eggs (opposed to sunnies) yesterdaywhich brings me to ending this review with my favorite item on the current menu - the chilaquiles  They are absolutely fantastic  Salsa pequin one of the salsas they pour over the dish is one of my favorite Mexican salsas (tomatoes and tomatillos both for a tangy and earthy spice)  Liberty does the chilaquiles as well as they can be done period  The net-net recap - Liberty is a great choice for almost any taste  It gets a 5 star review from me in part for that - but also for having some items that nobody nearby really does better - coffee pizza fish - and now chilaquiles  :).
Megan Roth has re-surfaced and now at this very cool salon Megan offers consistent service  gorgeous cut and color I've lost track of the compliments I receive on my hair Megan is the real deal Her scissors are a magic wand.
Finally tried this place (I know I'm soooo out of the loop) and I was very impressed It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times (sorry Matt's) The décor is great This old Taco Bell has barely been converted at all save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space The open-air roof keeps it breathable but you're cool as a cucumber The inside is diner supreme: bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room I think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions I had the sirloin and eggs I was craving something hearty and I got it This is like half a cow chopped up into little bites three eggs however you like them carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick It rocked my life And have you tried the Over Easy iced coffee Cold-brewed coffee (read: strong) over ice with sweetened condensed milk cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves It's f'ing ecstasy Try it you'll love it.
We have been coming to Olive Mill since it was just a tiny little shack in the middle of nowhere that was 7 years ago  And look at this place now  It's like our little child that grew up  Let's talk about the location  Yes it's in Queen Creek and it's quite a trek to get here if you don't live in the area but it's so worth it  During the Arizona cool weather the olive trees give a nice shady atmosphere in the front grounds  There is live music on the weekends wine tasting little kids running around and pets sniffing about  My brother from San Francisco says "It's like TuscanyI can't believe this is in AZ"  Staff:  I have seen them grow as well  They had their growing pains early in the days but now they are like a well oiled machine  Super helpful super friendly and they are there to please  Even if it gets busy on the weekends they are also with a smile  Food:  I would say it is a few dollars more than the usual placesbut this is not a usual sandwich shop either  The portions are big enough to share  We love getting the Antipasto Platter with a couple glasses of wine or beers or a bottle of wine to share and sit and enjoy the afternoon  The sandwiches are awesome  They get all of their meats from the local Pork Shop across the street  The veggies and herbs are straight out of their very impressive garden  They serve breakfast kids menu desserts too  Speaking of dessertsthey have a delicious selection of gelatoto die for  They recently started serving Oven Baked Pizzas on the weekend nights and it's really good  This is Italian Pizza thin crust  They have live music too and the atmosphere is really fun  The Olive Mill is a bonafide mill  They have olive trees and they have olive presses  They have tours so you can learn about the process of making olive oil  They have a super awesome store with all sorts of yummy olive goodnessdon't miss out on the Cup Cakes made with infused olive oilthey are heavenly  This is our weekend go to brunch place  And I highly recommend it They have been featured on Food Network and Dirty Jobs   I'm thinking of having my wedding anniversary in their courtyard somedaycatered by them   Hurray to our big gem in the East Valley :).
Super slow service I'm currently sitting here waiting for my takeout order I have been here for roughly 25 minutes and am receiving no help We might as well have eaten hereI probably would have gotten my food faster.
The only club car dealers in the area Great customer service and always helping the best they can If your on the market for a golf cart (gas or electric) and want the best come here for a club car golf cart and you'll be glad you did.
I just got back from from lunch at the Scottsdale location My girlfriend and I have had questionable service there before and had previously said that we were not going to again visit the establishment But today all I wanted was to have a sunbru relax and eat The hostess sat us down which to me it seemed like we were inconveniencing her conversation with the bus boy Then it seriously took the server 5 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink I had to ask her to bring us glasses of water I wanted to walk out but my girl insisted we stay now that we were there The server was attentive and pleasant and I began to relax Then i noticed the hostess walk behind the bar with her pepsi cup grab a bottle of whiskey and continue to pour herself a drink This seriously fired me up It seems I have more pride in the brand than she does I have been a patron of Four Peaks since I moved to AZ 11 years ago I've had parties at the Tempe location friends of mine have had baby showers there and it bums me out to see how drastically things have changed I support LOCAL as much as possible but today's episode only serves me to explore my other optionsI'll be heading to Chandler to check out SAN TAN Brewery or I will go Nimbus Bistrobums me out.
Great place to go in a stressful situation if you'd like to blow a couple grand and still not get a diagnosisI took my then 14-year old cat to this clinic last year on a Sunday with uncontrollable vomiting  She's an indoor cat with no history of ingesting foreign bodies  The initial vet I spoke to x-rayed her and performed blood tests which came up negative  She was admitted for "overnight observation" on a Sunday morning as her vet was not available until Monday  I was awakened by a 4 am phone call from another vet advising she needed "emergency" surgery that would cost $3500  Why  He didn't know but stated since her vomiting was not responding well to medication it was best to do the exploratory to look for this mysterious foreign body  I insisted she at least wait a few hours until she could get an ultrasound at the adjacent clinic when they opened  The ultrasound showed no indication of a foreign body or any other internal problemsLater that morning my own vet examined her and made an instant diagnosis of an allergic reaction to her new thyroid medication   And yes I had advised the emergency clinic of the medication the dosage and the length of time the cat had taken it when I arrived  She made a full recovery once back in the care of her regular doctor  Had I not trusted my own instincts I might have been influenced by the "expert" recommending this geriatric cat be operated on with no clinical indications However don't be concerned about unauthorized medical treatment  You are expected to pay for every test and treatment BEFORE they will do it  I do give this clinic one star as the cat did manage to survive.
How does one measure a little donut shop As far as I'm concerned one measures it by the friendliness of the staff and the availability of fresh delicious donutsThe family that opened this donut shop is amazingly friendly I've been in there at traditional times (Saturday or Sunday morning) but also odd times like Friday night They always have an incredible array of fresh donuts that are way better than the competition in my view Krispy Kreme can go home.
Amazing resort  Stayed here for five days over Thanksgiving week this year and was extremely impressed with every aspect of The Boulders resort  Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in the Scottsdale areaPros: The staff was overwhelmingly accommodating and helpful (they use golf carts/shuttles to transport you to different areas of the resort by request which was very much appreciated thanks Bill from Wisconsn)  The location was absolutely gorgeous and unlike anywhere I've ever been before (beautiful enormous boulders surrounding the resort grounds Saguaro cacti all around golf areas were beautiful and the various ponds and wildlife) The casita was pristine had a wood-burning fireplace (which we used a LOT) bed was super comfortable (I hadn't slept that well in months) and the bathroom was also amazing (double sinks bath tub glass shower walk-in closet etc)The Golden Door spa was very luxurious and the staff were very nice and professional  The massage was amazing as were the various saunas   The pool at the spa (which is open to all resort guests) was very relaxingMy boyfriend and his parents went golfing at The Boulders and they said that it was exceptional  More specifically:  the practice area (driving range short game area and putting green) was worth visiting on its own the course itself was extremely well run and the fairways and greens were in impeccable shape  Overall an extremely fun place to golf.
A little hard to find but well worth it Tried a hot mocha berry spritzer cinnamon roll and an apple "toptart" (homemade Pop Tart) Great prices and a homey atmosphere with plenty of tables and a neat aesthetic The woman working the counter was really nice and the pastries were super fresh and tasty and re-heated in the toaster perfectly without us having to ask The mocha was really creamy and well made and the berry spritzer was fresh and refreshing I wish this was closer - I would definitely be a regular.
This place does honestly does an excellent job with nails in every way They pay attention to details and make sure you only leave there satisfied.
Yay Phoenix You did this one rightI've always been able to find what I need I'm not sure that I love or hate the architecture but I did read about it in Dwell which is always just a bit impressive My only beef iswhy isn't there a cafe Does that make me a yuppie for wanting a coffee house in my library I promise it's only cause I desperately need the caffeine Either wayI love espresso and a good book But this library is top notch if you ask me.
I'm a fan of ZizzoI tried them after reading good things here on Yelp and they haven't disappointed  They do a very good job and they do it at a reasonable price  The best part however is the customer service  Everyone there is very personable and Phil is especially great to work withA couple of weeks ago I bought a new suit  Things fit pretty well but obviously I needed the pants hemmed  I called Zizzo in the morning dropped of the suit in the afternoon and they were able to get everything done per my request by closing time  They not only found time to hem the pants they also took in the seat - all in a couple of hoursI trust them with my clothes and encourage you to do the same.
I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's because it's so good First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order But there's only one thing I order each time I come here Nachos This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area Of course the serving size is generous I usually make it a point to not finish the plate it's so big It has the standard toppings the beans are good the red sauce that they drape over it is great But what makes these better then most is first the cheese love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler which makes it all nice and hot melts crisps up the cheese and the chips The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind So beware Staff here has always been nice I've never had an order go wrong never had an issue on quality or consistency.
Yummy vegan treats Not the most healthy but tasty and meat free.
Love their Belgium waffles.
This Discount Tire location has made a customer for life Everyone was friendly and the prices were fair Also I was in and out in about 30 minutes tires and all I was very impressed with the manager who went above and beyond what was needed I would definitely recommend this location to everyone.
First the service was amazingSecond the burger was amazingGo.
OMG LOVE THE COFFEE AND SERVICE Christine and Bruce at the coffee bare are truly fine and wonderful Stop and see them.
My husband and I are SO glad we discovered this place It is 5 miles from our house but worth the drive The donuts are fresh great variety great tasting and inexpensive SO much better than Dunkin and Krispy Kreme IMHO.
We happened on this little cafe by accident  It's really unassuming and in the shadow of a large fitness club  The food is great  Tasty and very fresh  The owner and servers were incredibly friendly and helpful  I had to write this review after reading the review that said that the service was poor  We had the complete opposite experience  The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomeWill definitely be back.
Awesome music super friendly Barista's delicious treats yummy satisfying beverages friendly regulars and plenty of room (when you consider the picnic tables outside as well - nice weather and sunlight permitting) The best in-house-made chai and whipped cream i've probably ever had I also love those lucky evenings when i go in & there is someone baking deliciousness that fills the place up with enticing aromasPS I'm definitely one of those people who will come to Lux to study or do homework for 3 sometimes 4 hours for those of you who complain about customers like myself maybe you should consider that we may spend about $20 a week there and are valuable customers to Lux - just like you are If my books are over crowding where a chair is and you would like to sit there please just ask I'd be happy to make room for others and share space.
This replica of a Parisian bistro serves up bistro classics such as the flatiron steak cassoulet with duck confit and delicious pommes frites It's a great place to sit outside at the patio cafe  Excellent wine list with many reasonably priced French wines.
This place is quirky and perfect and 5 stars deliciousness The lamb manti was divine The combo of cilantro and mint gave it a fresh kick We also enjoyed the pickled shrimp with fennel dish My only complaint but it wont affect "stardom" is that the wines were way overpriced Be sure to make a reservation and enjoy the culinary ride.
I love this place I go for the lunch specials Teriyaki Fried Rice and Orange chicken Yum 599 and it comes with a drink I go there so often the two owners know me by name Great local chinese food They call themselves Chinese fast food so don't expect all of the menu items of a nice sit down restaurant The quality of the food is worthy of a sit down restaurant though I would give them 6 stars if I could I'm obsessed :D.
I have been going there at least once a week since they opened (for food and coffee) and the staff is always pleasant the food is always good and the coffee is always terrific Great atmosphere inside and out So glad to hear they are opening another store at Scottsdale Quarter Now I can finally get some GOOD coffee when I am in the Kierland area.
I have been stopping in at Phx Ale since it opened it doors  I stop in about once or twice a month  The place is small little tasting room connected to the brewery/warehouse  They have continued to make the tasting room better - added an actual bar top put in a few TVS but it is a very low key place  Management really supports the local community so they have local artwork displayed around the tasting room  It fills the plain walls but I could see this as being a little overwhelming or tacky  You come here to try their beer there is no food but there are food trucks that will park in the parking lot on certain days  The beers seem to be getting better as the brewery expands their line-up  I believe they are up to seven beers they originally had three  The Ironwood Imperial Porter is legit  Even if you are not one to drink darker beers its worth a try  This is my favorite as the beers are more English style and I prefer hoppy beers and the Phx Ale Camelback IPA doesn't really do it for me  It is good just not what I look for in an IPA  Another plus is that you will order your beers from the owners (usually)  They are very friendly knowledgeable and laid back I highly recommend Phoenix Ale Brewery don't have high expectations in regards to aesthetics but it is all about experiencing the beer.
Same 4 people had dinner here a year later  We thoroughly enjoyed this place again  We started with two orders of their chopped salad and it is outstanding  You would make a big mistake to go to this restaurant and not order that  Very unique dish tasty and just overall enjoyable  For our main course I had their Pork Shank and it was terrific  Huge portion with very tender pork off the bone with a nice bark type crust yet so tender  My friend had their stuffed Pork Chop and raved about it and the two wives split 3 small plates--1 was a small version of their mushroom dish another was scallops with a beet risotto (they liked this one the best) and the third was a sliced BBQ Pork with a picked slaw--nice mixture of sweet and smoky  They really liked all 3 dishes  For dessert the 4 of us split a dessert called cereal killer which was ice cream with frosted flakes brittle caramel sauce and an oatmeal cookie  Very good and plenty for the 4 of us  Our waitress--Patricia was outstanding  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine and seemed genuinely interested in our well being  She is a top notch waitress  We will be back again next year when we come back for spring training.
What do you say about a place that is almost universally lovedWhat else can you do but heap more praise onto it at the risk of seeming sycophantic Lux is certainly amongst the best of the best for coffee in all of the greater phoenix metropolitan area In all five areas of criterion:~Taste: * * * * * the coffee brewed and sold here is perfect the confections and baked goods are simply wonderful~Decor: * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs~Pricing: * * * * * nothing here is expensive and considering the quality of the product sold very economical~Service: * * * * * the barristas are helpful friendly and good natured perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice please tip them~Ambience: * * * * * this ties in w/ decor but is meant to be more along the lines of "scene" and the players in that scene the folks who frequent Lux are my kinda folks (not as much as conspire but close) young professional hip artsy intelligent down town people who know good coffee when they see/smell/taste itSo hoped that helped for the fence sitters if for some reason you were perched precariously upon the fence to beging with.
This location is now closed.
Great place for a casual dinning experience Good food at a good price and close to home My daughter loves it because sometimes someone makes her a balloon animalThis is family run restaurant a real testament to the American dream that sometimes the average guy (family) can make good.
Chicken quesadilla chicken fajitas - sucked The chicken was flavorless and dry In fact it tasted as if it was microwaved/ pre-packaged And waaaay to expensive Will not eat at this chain again.
I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic italian deli style sandwiches I ordered their specialty sandwich with prosciutto fresh mozz olive oil peppers and it was outstanding The only reason I wouldn't get it again would be to try something else on the menu The bread alone was good enough to be eaten by itself There was little to no wait to have our orders taken and plenty of seating available which is not easy to find when looking for a place to eat lunch at noon during the weekDon't be fooled by the surroundings this place is a must try for all.
Super fresh  Super service  And super fuel for holiday shopping  Delicious donuts  And as a bonus they threw in about a half doz donut holes for free  These plus a cup of coffee and I'm invincible.
Before doing this hike I read through almost every review I got mixed reviews and wasn't really sure what to expect So here goes what I thought:There are two trails (for sure there could be more but I understand these to be the two main trails): Cholla and Echo Canyon Cholla is supposed to be easierEcho Canyon is supposed to harderWe originally planned to hike Cholla but after the GPS lead us to the Echo Canyon parking lot and we spotted a parking spot we pounced (after reading that parking is crazy) I'm not sure how we got so lucky but we did Anyways we realized we were at Echo Canyon and decided we'd try it even though I thought it would be too challenging my family persisted Well I was wrongEcho Canyon is NOT as hard as I expected Yes it is all uphill Yes you have to "climb" in some parts but no you are not "rock climbing" I expected having to heave myself up a ledge it is NOT like that There are two parts with metal railings they are really just to assist you You can get up without them but they are helpful It doesn't feel like you're going to fall because basically it's all ROCKS You're climbing on big rocks so you won't struggle to keep from sliding down Not like that at all Continuing up the trail you have to use your hands to help go up but it's not like you're using a ton of upper body strength Mostly you're using your hands for balance and a little extra "oomph" The way down is easier but does kind of hurt your knees (more jumping but not as much strength) So the hike for us- Took my parents (two adults late-40's workout a few times a week) about 2 hours They thought it was pretty hard but very fun They took periodic breaks though and were fine- Took my brother and I (two teenagers) probably 15 hrs or so I workout through sports or the gym almost every day but I am NO superhuman athlete like I thought you had to be I was expecting to be struggling and panting and dying climbing Camelback but it really was NOT that bad - Yes you do need good athletic shoes Yes you do need water No I don't think you need gloves or any fancy gear A snack at the top won't hurt but I wasn't craving nourishment - Kids are maybe okay doing it I saw lots of families with younger kids and they were doing okay True the child probably has to be at least 8 or into doing a challenging hike You can always turn around though But do be careful Sadly we saw on the news that an older man died later that day hiking the Echo Canyon trail Really monitor how you're feeling it's okay to turn around it is a tough trail But if you workout and enjoy physical activity this hike should be fineOverall LOVED the hike and had tons of fun Great workout and just a fun way to get active.
One of our favorite places for Lunch or Dinner Great selection of local mini-brew beers About the only thing they lack is WiFi.
Great guy knows his stuff.
Dave Deib at US Web Connection is a really experienced reliable resource in the world of SEO and web design  Talented hard working and generous I would call him your go-to guy for any business seeking to expand their online presence   I have found him to be extremely responsive and if there is an area in which he cannot accommodate you he will direct you to his many reliable resources in the business world  With so many fly-by-night operations that pop up in this industry and so many wild claims by people who just hung out their shingle after a couple of classes I would strongly recommend going directly to US Web and taking advantage of a source whose years of expertise and firmly established connections you can trust.
The place is clean and the donuts are very fresh I am a fan of their muffins They use plenty of walnuts on the banana nut muffins I bought a batch for the offcie and I was the hero of the day just that day (Lol) From my observation though they are pretty busy so you better get there early if you want to have a good selection Nice staff too.
Kris is quite honestly one of the most talented and qualified laser instructors in the country  No one has more experience no one is more accommodating and no one can make learning about lasers more fun than her Her state of the art training facility is UNBELIEVABLE Plus the small class sizes allow students to experience more hands on training than other schools that cram 10+ people in one room If you want to begin your career in lasers there is no better choice than Esthetic Advisor Laser Academy.
I have been in this place a few times since it's near my home and my daughter collects a particular line of action figures The man who has been running it every time I have been there is very unpleasant and basically acts like I am inconveniencing him when I ask questions I overlooked this because this is the only comic book place that carries the line my daughter collects It is either this place or ebay I recently went in to acquire a Valentines Day gift for my little one and was once again treated with unfriendly service They are in their new location and hadn't yet unpacked everything The guy behind the counter acted annoyed and told me to look around for what I was looking for He did not offer to track it down for me or call the dealer who sells the line He also did not seem knowledgeable on the collection itself Okay I guess he can't know everything in his store But what about taking my number and finding out It does after all bring you business to make your customers happy After wasting about 20 minutes of my time in a store that clearly did not care about whether they got my business I left I will never go back in which is too bad because I purchased 3 actions figures for my daughter here on 3 separate occasions I mean I know they are individual dealers but shouldn't they all care about bringing in business Anyway I went home disgusted and bought 2 actions figures online rather than in their store I will not recommend this place to anyone I really wanted to give my business to a local place and the actual dealer who sells the line is lovely (have only met him once) while in the store I should have asked for his number then because you never know when the dealers will be there  Oh well sorry dealer guy I would have eventually collected all you had for my daughter.
Tried this place because of a groupon  Good thing it was at a discount because it was not worth the moneyWhile the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area that is about all this place has going for itI can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa especially when the salsa is below averageI ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed  First the waitress messed up my order  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice this is a mexican restaurant right  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans  Ummok  I didn't complain bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food  But this is definitely a first  Overall the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard  I will not return.
A local favorite for years that has slowly been straying away from classic dishes to make room for some more adventurous tastes Everything is good but try their bruschettas my favorite being the PBJ bruschetta Very interesting.
We LOVE   Jersey Mikes We love the club sub Mike's Way If you think Subway makes good subs then you will just die when you eat a Jerzy Mike's sub The taste is completely different it's like comparing apples to oranges Also the employees will laugh and joke with you I don't know if that's part of their job description but I like it They always remember me & they always give me a free cookie with my sub The prices are much higher that Subway but for what you get the price is actually lower Not to mention that it is SO much better Once you try Jerzy Mikes you'll never go back to Subway again.
The $2 kids cone is a steal for fresh made Gelato Some cheaper ice creams have that "light" feel to them These delicious concoctions are fresh made daily and are filling The prices are higher  but you're getting quality A great afternoon treat I will be coming back soon.
Went here the other night and I ordered the chopped salad the pimientos and some red sangria The pimientos which are cooked peppers were SOOOOO good There were a few spicy peppers in there which made this appetizer flavorful The chopped salad was the usual deliciousness I got it without cheese and with the lime dressing instead of the creamy chipotle dressing they put on it In the past I have had it with the chipotle dressing and it's reallllllly goodThe red sangria was good a little sweet but the fruit was plentiful and it was refreshing I like sweet though so it's all good.
Great prices great selection and a very clean store Right in the heart of things to do in Scottsdale Love it.
More wine than you can shake a corkscrew at  Shelves and shelves of import and domestic beer brands and the recent addition of growlers with local craft beers  It rocks  A walk-in Humidor  dig it.
Wish we could have made it thru the gridlock of parking Tempe/Scottsdale have a hard time handling events Should have been downtown and could have used light rail.
I went to this store twice to buy a pair of nice work shoes The first time I found exactly what I wanted and went up to the counter to get a pair to try on The associate didn't greet me at all and took the shoe from my hand and went to the back to retrieve the shoes I walked away before she got back I went back a week later did the same thing and this was a different associate She looked at me like I was a Leper when I walked up the counter took the shoe from my hand Not one smile from either of these woman not one hello I turned and walked away from this woman as well This store hires stuck up 20ish snobs They don't deserve my business and they won't ever have the opportunity to get it again.
What a gem Any beer lover MUST go to Sun Devil My life would be a better place if I had this place closer to my home but alas I only make it to Mesa once a year DO NOT PASS UP the opportunity to go to the bar in the basement- an absolutely BRILLIANT use of a space which could have been simply storage but now hosts a beautiful bar with room after room of over sized and ridiculously comfortable furniture in a cool (as in "escape the AZ heat") and relaxing environmentI have to say it again- if you like beer- go to Sun Devil- the selection is truly mind boggling  Oh and PS- they have a drive thoughfreaking awesome.
Best shrimp tacos in Mesa Hands down Everyone who works here is so darn friendly I love this place Best Mexican food in PHX as far as I'm concerned.
Always friendly clean & if there is a problem they will look into.
My friends and I had a great time here   We stopped in for dinner and drinks because we were staying next do at the San Carlos Hotel   The food was great   I had the Patty melt and my friend had fish and chips  They were delish   The waitstaff was super helpful and friendly  There was life music in the pub/restaurant too.
I'm enjoying coming her for PT to improve a hamstring injury  They are great with being flexible with my schedule and all the PT assistants there are very knowledgeable and help me with form while doing my exercises  My PT Chris is a nice guy knowledgeable and correctly diagnosed my injury  They use Astym to help heal the injury (hurts but effective) and give me a lot of exercises to do  Very clean place and convenient location/easy parking.
Awesome awesome awesome My mom and sister and I were on vacation in Phoenix and happened upon this place I am so glad we didThe drinks were amazing the lamb appetizer to die for and the trout was unlike anything I have ever tastedOur waiter was so attentive I only wish I didn't live a plane ride away.
Heaven forbid that any act I'm into is seeking a show palace out in Phoenix's paved over backyard Mesa ArizonaShort of a Smiths one-show-only reunion I will never venture here just to park my happy ass 3 miles from the venue plant my ass in an ocean of unenthusiastic knuckleheads who insist on sitting on their ledge in lieu of standing and praying for a geyser of alcohol to emerge from Mesa's rancid underground so that I may indulge in a beverage past 9 o'clockNo proper show should EVEN START by 10pm much MUCH less end by that time  WTF  How in the world did this venue even get approved  This is like getting a chance to party on the tour bus with Van fucking Halen only they decided to reunite with Gary Cherone as their frontman and they all were experimenting with homosexuality that week and drank Mr Pibb instead of Maker's Mark  A freaking nightmare this place.
They have a variety of nice boats that are well maintained and fairly new  Lots of extras available like tubes and wakeboards.
Great service Packed my goods and arrived on time on perfect condition  Very happy with Joe Demarco and the UPS Store.
We had a meeting scheduled for Capistrano's to supply our restaurant with bread and buns  We waited over a half an hour before deciding we would need to reschedule  Later after we left the gentleman we had a meeting with called us   Instead of apologizing for wasting our time he proceeded to blame us for being late when we were 5 minutes early  After that failed he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office twice on his cell phone and even sent him and E-mail  Apparently Capistrano's has all the customers it needs and isn't really looking for more  Take your business elsewhere.
Finally a grocery store in Scottsdale that isn't trying to rob me Don't get me wrong I like Safeway Albertson's and Basha's but come on what's with the sky high prices I like good food and variety but I don't wanna go broke either shopping for it Fresh & Easy was made for me THANK YOU for the discount sections.
Best brewery on the west side Burgers and service are top notch We love our waitress Shannon and the outdoor patio.
I only gave this 5 stars because that was the limit My wife and I just had a one-to-one meal with the Head Chef Claudia His passion for food is incredible the man is a geniusThe experience was $65 per head I defy anywhere in Scottsdale to match this for value for money.
You must go hereWent during the "Yelp Eats" promotionEverything we experienced was remarkable The service food drinks and ambiance were all spectacularFirst the drinks There are numerous specialty cocktails an extensive wine list draft and bottled beers aperitif digestif single malt scotch and almost every type of alcohol you could expect Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere such as dessert wines We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH Good booze & good bartenders can't let those go to waste We had to have something with gin so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni Both were what we expected Strong & unique I don't see anyone disliking Aviation but Count Negroni is for specific tastes Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors The Campari in this drink makes a statementSecond the food We ordered the "Smart Chicken" and the Berkshire Pork Loin The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat The risotto mushrooms and onions that came with it were amazingNow the pork The pork This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again We all love bacon but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor not for its leanness Granted I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit but it was absolutely amazing They cooked it perfectly Pink and moist on the inside The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork but also the proper preparation The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly as did the pistachios The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn't tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavorThird the dessert The bread pudding was fantastic Like the best apple pie you've ever eatenonly better The ice cream that came with it was great as well I ordered a cup of coffee as well from Roastery of Cave Creek called "Black and Tan" One of the better cups of coffee I've ever had Even my girlfriend enjoyed it and it had no cream or sugar She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn't need anythingFourth the service Our server Brian was very knowledgeable and very courteous He answered every question we had gave us the proper attention and made sure we enjoyed our experience I can't remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPHOverall everything you want in a restaurant It's in a great location in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale I can't compliment this place enough Just go.
I'm trying to cut down on the number of places that I give five stars to and only give that if a business really really deserves it but I have to give five stars to Pho Avina  They have the best Vietnamese food that I've found in the valley and I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the heavily Asian part of Chandler (Cyclo Pho Van Anise etc)  The pho here is absolutely terrific and is really packed full of flavor  The other dishes I've tried have also all been fantastic and everyone I've taken here has absolutely loved it  Seriously nobody has had a bad dish or a bad experience  The staff is extremely friendly and if you have questions about anything they'll spend as much time as you need helping you out even though it might be in slightly broken English  Add on to all of this that you can get a huge bowl of pho for $7 and there's really nothing bad that can be said about this placeGuess what else  They have boba tea  I was concerned that when I was living in North Phoenix for a few weeks I wouldn't be able to get boba tea as easily as I could in Chandler but Pho Avina once again saves the day  Their boba is a little bit softer than I prefer but it's still good and definitely worth gettingFinally if you're feeling really adventurous Pho Avina has both durian boba tea and durian ice cream  I haven't checked but they may even be able to bring you a small plate of durian if you ask nicely  For those who don't know durian is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and is known for having one of the most foul odors of anything in the world  Durians smell so bad that some Asian countries have banned them from subways and other public places similar to smoking bans  People either love them or hate them - I personally think durian tastes like a mix of rotten onions and garlic so I'm not a big fan  A friend of mine thinks they taste like a mix of feet and death and actually instantly threw up the first time he bit into a piece of the fruit  Still though some people absolutely love durian and it's definitely something worth trying once in your lifeThis place has it all and although I'm moving out of Phoenix in just a few days I'm going to make damn sure that I visit Pho Avina every time I come back.
all the way from calihad to have this place oh how i love the food great place icant lie i love there food.
This has to be my favorite breakfast spot  I love the crunchy edges of their pancakes  Even when they are packed the food quality is consistent    I am a happy girl.
This place rocks on Tuesdays with $1 tacos and cheap drinks  Try the Lobster Sampler Platter (if you're not going for the $1 tacos on Tuesdays)Chips and Salsa and right on everyone friendly ok for kids in the restaurant section  Has a little patio and an upstair couchy loungey bar area (never been there for drinking but I did sneak upstairs with my son to check out the layout -- it's a habit I have of pacing out real estate)  Would be a perfect place to rent out for a party or event probably holds like 40 seated standing room for another 30 or so).
Since this location is right down the street from our house we always go there We've never been disappointed with anything here and we absolutely love going Everything is so delicious even the Green-V It took me a while to try it but I'm glad I finally did so even their veggie juices are good :)Everything else of course is also delicious Our favourites include the Hummingbird Pomegranate Power and Caja Cooler We used to love Jamba Juice but now we can't go back there haha It's probably the employees and the owner though everyone is just so nice there and very helpful if you have any questions about any of the drinksKeep up the great work guys Definitely as good as it gets.
FIVE stars for carrying New Mexico Hatch chile eom.
Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around  I love Rosita's.
Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshopThis place is by far my favorite new discovery in ages  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly so I really wanted to check it out  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so soonerMy friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future  Before taking our drinks my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display I must admit I drooled a bitBecause it was such a nice night we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks  It wasn't long before more people showed up  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier and I ended up going inside to buy one  My choices were vanilla red velvet lemon and strawberry (I think)  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies  Very nice touch  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happyI've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru  The first time the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order  When I told him I didn't he told me he would give me one and he did - along with three stamps  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake  The smoothie was just as ood as the first but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at StarbucksI love supporting local businesses and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again  I suggest you do too.
I went to this place because I had purchased a Groupon deal that included x-rays a cleaning and teeth whitening  After an hour and fifteen minutes there I am with x-rays a dental hygienist telling me I need to floss and no cleaning  I expected the whitening to happen on a different visit but not even a cleaning After over an hour.
The staff is friendly the beer is ample and the atmosphere is nice and casualWait  Duck pizza  Yes it is as awesome as you think it is  Go order it.
Just picked my dog up from Sonoran Desert day car where they'll happily wait around for 5 minutes for you - they love people's business there Immediately left there and called Wag-n-wash of Scottsdale where they must have more business than they want Just having moved from Castle Rock where they have another store with a different owner that ran a GREAT business we're now in Phoenix where we thought we'd find the same Nope not so much Called after the pickup to make sure they are open said I need a dog wash was told to be there before 7 no problem They close at 8 Got there after driving from north Phx to south Phx there by 6:40 Was told by the young man that we had to be done by 7 my wife said "maybe a few minutes after will be ok" - get this - his reply "well no you're just too late We HAVE to clean AT seven" Like I said must have to much business Oh and BTW wouldn't even give me the owners name to call only a managers name Poor guy that owns it won't even know how people are tanking his business Too bad Colorado store was great Not do much here in Phx Bill@usa-onecom.
What a day brightenerSleep deprived and in a post-delivery fog upon coming home from the hospital after the birth of my daughter I was the recipient of a gorgeous assortment of flowers and an adorable stuffed animal from Flora Unique FloristThey were definitely unique and fun and are still going strong a week after deliveryI hadn't heard of this florist before but I will be using them in the future when it's time for me to send flowers to someone locally for sureThanks FUF for the awesome surprise and thanks to my work team for sending them too :).
Worst pho I have ever had Rubbery beef crunchy noodles and tasteless broth Look else where for Pho.
CARTEL COFFEE LAB  has assumed proprietorship of Sola Coffee Bar and is providing espresso addicts with uber-excellent thick- crema libations made by using a deceptively small La Marzocco machine---TRY IT .
Friends have often told me how great Thai food is but until tonight I've never had the opportunity to taste it myself  Well I'm happy to tell you that after going to 75th Thai Taste with my friend tonight I am a fellow fan of Thai foodAs I pulled up to the restaurant I noticed a small Mexican joint next to it and the Mexican blood flowing through my veins pumped a little faster as I considered the possibility of eating Mexican instead  However I was determined to get a taste of Thai at 75th Thai Taste (plus I had a good friend whom I haven't seen in a while waiting for me inside)As I entered the door I noticed right away how clean the restaurant was  I also noticed that the tables and chairs were not the same mundane fast-food-type furniture  On the contrary the furniture was different and invitingMy second observation was the glass of water my friend had in which a slice of lime was floating  I've never seen that before as most restaurants use slices of lemon but I was excited because I delight in the taste of lime more than I do that of lemonsAs I browsed the menu I noticed many entrees that I wanted to try however I made the decision to order the Stir Fried Asparagus with beef it also came with steamed riceI didn't wait long at all before the food arrived  The portion of food on the plate looked like more than I could handle -- it was a very generous portion  :-)  Green asparagus along with red and green bell peppers freckled the brown beef  It looked delicious so I dug right inThe first bite had me hooked  I surprised myself by eating the whole meal but it was too delicious to save until laterI give 75th Thai Taste 5 stars  It was my first time trying Thai food so I don't have anything to compare it to  But the food was so delicious the restaurant was clean and the service was friendly so if you're around 75th and McDowell try 75th Thai Taste  I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
Seriously JR's fish and chips Try JR's Fish Sticks and Fries  You are better off saving some money and going to the Fry's across the street and buying frozen pre-battered fish and frozen fries.
I miss this place so much Im in Bay Area now and I think of Giuseppe's bolognese sauce almost every weekend Their simple tomato sauce is sooooooo good Wish I knew the recipe And the eggplant appetizer is to die for YUMMY I miss you guys.
Had to try this place and I will definitely be going back I got the Vasito de Elote which was just as good as on the Cobb It was an appetizer so the portion was prefect maybe 4ozThey make the guacamole at your table It's different from how I make it smashed They dice the avacado add everything and even pomegranate Lime juice is freshly squeezed I saw them at the bar squeezing it  for my micheladas which was also good and only $4 Suizas enchilada- $15 The smell of them reminded me of my nanas homemade corn tortillas And the Tomatillo sauce on it was just the right spicy I will def go again All staff was nice and very helpful We even bought a shot glass$350 and a T shirt$20.
Ever since I went to Tim F's I can't stop talking about this place it's just so awesome I went before noon for the lunch special unreal 3$ beer and 5$ lunch mon-thurs best turkey sandwich ever I can't wait to go back.
Not like Roka Akor needs another 5 star review but it really is that good Went there on Friday with the GF BF and sat at the chef bar This is a great spot to watch all the amazing creations come out of the kitchen whether it be the sushi chefs or the grill Our server was fantastic and very attentive and the manager was wonderful (great wine recommendations) Both had great suggestions and they were more than happy to accommodate our gluten free requests (FYI - they have tamari in house) We started with the edamame butterfish (amazing) and the scallops (heaven) These are not large portions and we were starving but everything was delicious We then moved to sushi were the BF found a common love for special salts (pink house made curry black volcanic green team and finally truffle) with the manager From that point on we were hooked on this place We had the spicy scallop roll and the salmon/avocado roll Both were amazing especially the salmon which was sensational From there we took a pause before the final round As we were watching the sushi chef he created an off-the menu steak tartare nigiri style with a cracked quail eggthe manager insisted we try it and it was fantastic Such a delightAfter some more time to digest we decided to go with the Yuzu Marinated Black Codthis was a first for me and OMG I am a huge fan Buttery melt in your mouth amazing fish We also ordered some rice and veggies on the side but the chef came over and advised us to a sampler instead especially so there was no gluten in the veggies Out comes a buffet of yummy items off the grillzucchini's with lemon tempura veggies (not GF though) and my oh my the asparagus This was all just fantastic We couldn't get out without a little GF cake and finally finally we rolled outta there after 3 and half hours of shear delight We will be back (probably sooner than they may want us too) as it was spectacular.
Just tried YC's for the first time and already know there will be a second and third times to come The staff showed me how it worked and I was amazed at the selection and just how much food could fit in the large bowl YC's is awesome.
I was a bit skeptical of Postino because I had heard so many great things about it and didn't really understand how bruschetta could be that great but now I'm a believer It's the whole package of the location the vibe the constant crowd and of course - the amazing food I ordered a board of bruschetta planning to split it with my friend but then remembered she is unable to have gluten It was so delicious that I finished the whole board by myself I just couldn't say no to the brie apple & fig or red peppers & goat cheese or prosciutto fig & marscapone or the burrata bacon arugula & tomatoes My fave of these four was the brie apple & fig Deeee-lish.
Awesome view and great place for a wedding My friends got married up in the church at the top of the hill and we had a great picnic table dinner served by the fire they made Open bar friendly staffwas fabulous experienceOnly downfall is wish the town stayed open later.
if you have a few extra pounds you are wanting to loose the owner will look at you in disgust she presented this place as one for those who are extremely physical fit  not to over share but i have a medical condition which will never allow me to look like work out barbie i wanted to try something new and she showed me the door i lost the money i put into and felt completely humiliated so if you are not in tip top shape she may pull up the faq's and show  you to the door.
Don't let the strip mall setting deter you  This restaurant has some of the best tasting fish in town  When you walk in the servers are very friendly and quick to seat you  They recently expanded so it doesn't feel as cramped as before  The quality of the tuna is the best I've had in town  When you bite down your teeth easily cut through the fish while keeping a good tuna consistency  The prices are not inflated like your typical Scottsdale sushi restaurant  They even have appetizer specials where you buy a bottle of Kirin and you get a choice of 6 appetizers for only $50  I highly recommend this place to any fan of great sushi with equal service.
The live events are excellent so verify they have something playing when you visit  You can spend days in this museum if you love music so be prepared   try to catch the apollonia music show that happens everyday   The museum restaurant was also really impressive  We had a chestnut soup that was spectacular.
Whether it is a burrito taco or nachos everything served at Joyride is delicious and is made with the highest quality ingredients Did I mention it is at an affordable price as well It's been a 5 star experience all three times I've been here.
We ordered a steak sandwich and the raspberry chipotle boneless wings everybody was raving about  The steak in the sandwich had no flavor I've had better steak at a chinese buffet  The bread was kind of nasty  almost stale but I think its just how it comes  The tots were the thing we liked but how do you screw that up  The wings were shrivelled - kind of like chinese food in a way where they batter and fry up chicken pieces that are sliced thin and then cover with sauce  The ends were dried up chicken and batter that were more like jerky than wings  The sauce was creative but definitely not the next ranch or honey mustard  Maybe a little more of a spicy kick would make it betterAll in all won't go back  Mostly because we don't live in the area so the next time we're there we'll try something else  If it was in my neighborhood I might go back for happy hour  Their drinks looked pretty cheap and I wouldn't feel so bad about the wings if I'm paying half price and drunk.
This is a no-brainer Go It has weird hours Go The menu is complicated Go Good Tex-Mex and Northern Mexican I was born here and have spent a lot of time in Mexico I don't mess around with OK Mexican placesNo frills No convenience No BS Great food.
Love this place Only get to the Phoenix area once or twice a year and make a point to go to Old Pueblo My favorites are the carne asada and Mexican Flag enchiladas Love the fish tacos too Friendly service and reasonably priced as well.
This place is phenomenal I highly recommend the cajun red snapper seasoned veggies  and red beans and rice The waiter was incredibly polite and created a delightful dining experience.
been coming to this location for years  great service and a good cut for a very reasonable price  I always get the MVP that comes with hot towel service during the shampoo sitting in a massage chair and them a shoulder/back massage after  You can't beat that for about $20Bridget is da bomb there I go once a month for my fix  buy a season pass and you get 6 mvp's for the price of 5.
IF you can get in here you will love it Be warned the Breakfast and Lunch rush can get mobbed They offer a lot of different options and all that I have tried are excellent.
Some of the best Italian I've ever had It was pleasantly surprise The place doesn't look that great from the outside but the food makes up for it The martini's were expensive and not that great Pasta is made right at the restaurant Highly recommend getting some pasta Staff was friendly.
Great place for funfooddrink and entertainment and the prices are reasonable They provide a free shuttle service Lots of TV's for all games even on Sunday NFL Outside fire pit  when chilly outside with misters when it's hot This is a sports bar not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and they always have specials on food and drink plus a reverse happy hourManagement keeps this place clean and neat with great help from staff and servers.
They've been always so great with the kids on a tour Loved coming back year after year.
On my way to Yelp glory :) So I'm really starting to like this place  With the weather cooling off their patio is really cozy and they have a live acoustic band out there to set the mood  Really chill  Ambiance-So there is a more formal dining area in 1 part of the restaurant and then there is a dining area by the bar and some couches and chairs even for group gatherings  Then there's tables for dining outside  What can I say they have 3 cool areas depending on your crew and mood you are in  The bar has many chairs you can belly up to and the bartender that I encountered was so nice it caught me off guard Kudos to service there The decor is very much wine bar-centric and many cool pictures on the walls  A very relaxing setting  Cuisine-They offer 6 types of bruschetta as well as a variety of meats and cheeses with their antipasto selections  Great to pair with their extensive wine by the glass selections  Both I've had and they are amazing I can't speak to the entree's because if I'm trying different wines I'm  into more of pairing/small plate type of mood  Had the chop salad as an appetizer and that was delicious as well  Service-Right as you walk in the hostess is right there to greet you and ask you where you'd like to sit  As I stated above more of the formal dining area casual dining area bar or patio all open as options (if place isn't packed of course)  The wait staff and bartender are really personable and happy to address any questions regarding the wine or food  Service was very prompt as well  Overall I give this place the highest rating because all of the aforementioned criteria  If you feel likewise by all means check it out  Tell em Croft sent ya :).
I've been here 3 times and each time the staff was rude and the wait very long Trying to give them a fair chance but today was last straw got eyebrows waxed and I have skin ripped off my eyelidsit is horrid Tell me they didn't know this I get red all the time so didn't notice at first but I'll never go back.
I've found a new grocery shopping destinationand I think I may be in love Sure I don't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for and I don't really care for dates but there is just so much goodness in between the mystery items that it doesn't matter I'm hooked The produce is cheap and much better than the comparably cheap Ranch market nearby and you just can't beat a package of freshly made pita for fifty cents The spice array is dizzying and I really want to find out what one does with Pomegranate syrup  One distinct advantage Baiz has over other markets is the meat counter Where else in town can you get fresh lamb and goat Baiz market is so great that it now has a place in regular rotation on our grocery outings As a bonus the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip.
Airport dining options have come a long way over the past few years sadly this Round Table Pizza is not part of that trend After the server finished her cell phone call in the back room I was treated to a slice of pepperoni pizza who's crust was almost indistinguishable from the paper plate it was served on That and a domestic draft ran me about $850 Shoulda just gone with two brews.
Cambodian food is so good and I'm very happy to see a restaurant is available in Phoenix now  Otherwise I'd have to visit California   The soup basil stir fry papaya salad and lemongrass chicken are all good choices here.
Thank you yelp This place is a do over do over and another do over By far some of the best Vietnamese food we've ever eaten The place is immaculately clean the food is unbelievable and the proportions are more than generous Best part can't beat the prices will be back again probably tomorrow.
Someone needs to tell the folks that own this place to stop right now and get out before they lose all their money Sunday brunch buffet was unedible The potatoes were something to the tune of fossilized rubber of which both my friend and I spit into our napkins at the same time The omelet I'd gotten from the omelet bar they had set up was swimming in a POOL of butter/grease/margarine() I tried to blot off some of said grease but after one bite my taste buds said ' nooooo way' Also got a waffle from the omelet bar and I could have done better w/ a frozen toaster waffle at home (which I haven't eaten since childhood and didn't enjoy them then) The iced tea was a winner So was the sliced pineapple  I support independently owned businesses and am sad to say I don't imagine this place being around much longer Waitstaff was friendly but probably confused at taking away plates of food w/ one bite out of things  We went to Matt's Big Breakfast afterward and left satisfied happy and full So Squash Blossom I had high hopes for you.
keen to view star wars items when i viset AZ  and one keen to support a kiwi find cool items .
As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate I love Ethiopian food And now that I work in northern Tempe I'm here all the time It's filling flavorful and inexpensive I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10 If you like me think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.
A coworker and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott across the street and got a recommendation for this place from the front desk We walked to Nabers and after our first meal we were hooked We went there for dinner for the next three night of our stay The wait staff is great and we even met the Nabers who were extremely gracious The food was awesome there wasn't a meal we didn't like My personal favorite was the Asian salad with Salmon While you're there also try the Naber's Pale Ale brewed by a friend of the owners I would highly recommend this place to those traveling in the area as well as locals How long until one opens up in Austin TX.
Yummy yummy yummy  FISH TACOS  If I lived within walking distance to this place I would eat here everyday and weigh 600 pounds  That's how good their fish tacos are.
The ambiance was promising when we all arrived  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide) plus the usual sidesWhat I got was essentially steak tartar with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating so I had a second  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare it was completely raw  basically refrigerator-cold to the tongueSo steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant to no avail  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by and explained the situation  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'A few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever no refills on water/drink etc  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering) and everyone else was most way through theirs  With wine glass completely empty no service for refills forthcoming I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of waterSteak #2 was marginally better but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again all-rare tartar in the middleI gave up after a few bites just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotelI didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit  This I regarded as a final insult as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over againI hope others have a better experience.
So I had a pair of sunglasses that need some major tweaking (the kind of stuff I couldn't do myself) and these guys did it for free even though I was clear that I did not buy them there  When I offered to pay something for their effort they just asked that I keep them in mind when I buy in the future  I will most definitely do that.
My husband and I used a Groupon here for a wine tasting with my parents and we had a lot of fun We kicked back and tasted their yummy appetizers and wine while we played some games and had great conversation Our waiter was very kind (especially since it was a wine and cheese tastingand I have a cheese allergy) and accommodating We would definitely go back.
We ordered take-out from Il Bosco last night and was extremely pleased with the food but also the service I wasn't expecting much since it was almost closing time and from my experience with other places is that the employees usually want to get out of there so theres attitude or a sense of being rushed to get me out the door but when I arrived to pick up my order the owned greeted me with such a cool calm and collected demeanor which  was such a pleasure he even helped me carry my food and walked me out to my car The place itself had a great atmosphere I can see myself and my husband coming back to eat in next time I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.
Poor service on weekends AND my to-go order was messed up  Will never come back here.
Every last thing I've tried from their menu has given me a mouth-gasmThis place has RE-defined the sandwich.
Do not eat sushi here The service was good the bartender was pleasant but the fish was terrible We ordered tuna and salmon nigiri which was completely dried out and in a word disgusting I have to assume the other reviews refer to the wok menu because the sushi was a health code violation waiting to happen.
Love the family atmosphere very welcoming & friendly excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry.
First impressions do not mean a thing at this facility  I arrived for my first appointment and was forgotten Literally  they did not check me in After 30 minutes if waiting I asked for them to check how much longer it would be and instead of telling me they didn't check me in they take yet another 10 minutes to tell me At this point I ha e no choice but to reschedule because I have to pick up my kids I was told they would see me next month They still had the nerve I will NOT recommend this facility to anyone  It doesn't matter how shinny and new it is if they have crappy customer service it is a shame that I didn't get to meet the Dr She may be great but her staff is horrible.
Our stay here was great all around even though the hotel is currently doing some construction work  The service was polite and excellent all around  Our room was clean comfortable and very nicely appointed  Great large bathrooms and just nice all aroundWe spent time at the pool for a Yelp event and really liked it  There are good views all around and the bar is easy to get to and well stockedAside from the restaurants right in the hotel there are a whole lot of very good options within a couple minutes of walking.
Have been to many productions here and just saw OklahomaA Wonderful Experience at a Value price that cannot be toppedA Great local Asset.
Went to check out this new treat place and was completely impressedI was like "Oh hell ya vegan gelato"Frank helped us out offering us samples and letting us know what he puts in the gelatos to make them I chose a bit of the Pistachio Soy Gelato and Chocolate Soy Amaretto There wasn't a bit left in the bowl after 5 minutes I am going to be gaining some pounds over the summer I can already tell.
Several years ago I was on Vacation with my family in France For the hell of it we decided on day one to identify the very best Creme Brulee in Paris We ordered Creme Brulee after dinner we ordered it after lunch we even picked up a few Creme Brulee's at popular patisserie's throughout the city Our Creme Brulee's would make their way around our table and we would discuss the merits of each We analyzed those little euro custards as if we were trying to impress an eavesdropping Anthony Bourdain Did we prefer it with or without vanilla beans Warm or cold Deep remekin or shallow When it was all said and done we found the best Believe it or not we did the same thing in a little Mexican village called San Miguel de Allende Only this time it wasn't Creme Brulee it was Chilaquiles When our trip was over I assumed that we found the best in San Miguel possibly even the best in the world I was wrong Whatever we deemed superior in San Miguel was completely outmatched by the Chilaquiles I had last Friday evening at Gallo Blanco Simply amazing A perfect blend of savory spicy chile with the faintest hint of citrusy sweetness It had a wonderful contrast of various textures and just enough crispiness on the top layer to make me forget the failed excessively soggy versions of my past  And it was all topped off by two perfectly cooked eggs sunny side upThe service and atmosphere were also exceptional I can't wait to go back.
I will never come back here They couldn't understand how to make a Mocha Frappe with Hazelnut flavor Once that was finally figured out I overheard that they had spilled my drink dumping half the contents out I saw them pick up the cup and used the same cup to remake my drink when I asked for a new drink in a clean cup the shift supervisor got huffy about it angrily grabbed my drink threw it hastily in the trash can and made me a new drink in a clean cup finally Although they did give me a card that says they were sorry I had a bad experience enjoy a beverage on us that didn't excuse the bad customer service and possible health violation of serving a drink in a dirty cup This Starbucks was very packed and very poorly ran I would expect more out of a place like this and would assume anyone else would have wanted a clean cup as well.
I realize this is a fast food place but I have to say that the food my wife and I had was not great at all I had the fried pork tenderloin sandwich which was a combination of who knows what's pig part The majority was fat and gristle My wife had a burger which was greasy and not all that memorable The girl ringing us up was rude and unhelpful when asked about items on the menu We did not have any custard which there known for but we were so displeased with everything that we didn't want to give them anymore of our money We will not be going back.
The best ice cream sandwich in town and (for future reference) they deliver What's not to likePlenty of adventurous flavors if you're into that sort of thing and if you want the usual suspects (I'm a mint chip aficionado) you'll be pleased I'm going to be back A lot.
My favorite froyo place ever  They literally have the best tart yogurt I've ever had  I've been to Golden Spoon Yogurtland Redmango Icetangobut they do not compare to YB  They are really innovative with their ever changing flavors.
I'm a sucker for alcohol and the drinks here are great Marrrrrrgaritas Food was as expected from the most rated place I've been to Expect to be elbow to elbow on a packed night No complaints here but if that's not your thing.
Always get my water here Very friendly people They always offer to rinse out my containers They have great tasting water and sell water containers in multiple sizes The best deal is the water card you get 50 gallons for $10 that's 20 cents a gallon If you eat sweets I also reccomend the Rocky Road.
I had never heard of Sweet Republic until a week ago  I knew they were celebrating their birthday by giving away free single scoops of ice cream  I read several reviews and not one of them had anything bad to say about it  I am now one of those reviews  This place is awesome  I had the brownie swirl  Love it  Check this place out  They also have sorbet.
I love FE This is my go to spot for almost all of my grocery needs I love the produce section even though its a lil on the expensive side but you can always find organic I adore the premade meals too which is so convenient for me and my fam on those nights I don't feel like cooking Plus its good to be able to read and understand the ingredients on the packaging  The wine section isn't shabby either This is the ONLY place where I will buy my Malbecand the price is nice too I can be finicky about my wine too so this hits the spot and tames the beast They also sell my staples quinoa olive oil nuts coconut water just to name a few I am so glad this location is here to stay FE is my spot and always will be.
This place is outstanding Burgers are fantastic huge boutique soda selection soft serve ice cream with owners that are friendly and happy to provide great service and food I will be back as often as I can.
Fun dog-friendly brunch spot with nice patio (they even have a dog menu) Service was friendly It was a little slow to get a table and get our food but we were a large group on a Saturday morning Lots of healthy and not so healthy options It's definitely the kind of place where everyone in your group can find something they like.
I really enjoy this place for breakfast Really comfortable seating and nice ambiance  I like the sausage and egg with cibatta  Prices not a steal but comfortable enough Coffee selection is nice as well.
the only thing i can review is the bean and cheese burrito because that's all i get and it's all i ever needtheir refried beans are the creamiest most savory in all of phoenix (i would except for casa reynoso except this is owned by the same family)i can't even find words for much i enjoy their perfect tortillas but i can say that i can gobble a burrito up in about 45 seconds and i am the world's slowest eater true story.
I love this restaurant The lettuce wraps are out of this world  I have tried other versions and P F Changs wins hands down  Yum.
I contacted Todd at Harvest Design Group initially only to get a bid on a house we were purchasing in Phoenix and even with a very short time frame he managed to help me He is so kind and helpful i spoke to him personally on the phone  never a receptionist or a machine He knows what hes talking about and hes not out to steal all your money I HIGHLY recommend using Todd He well transform your backyard into a paradise.
Some of the best pizza anywhere  Period.
1/22 and 1/23I ADORE The Kitchen  So much so I ended up visiting three times in one week :)  [Unfortunately I only have photos from the first two visits as I had misplaced my SD card after the third]  Wow where do I start  The front of the venue reminds me of an AJ's Fine Foods or a (very) mini-Whole Foods: there's the bread aisle to your right as you walk in cash registers to your left and straight ahead is the cold food section where you may find deli side items (along w/ roasted veggies and crisp asparagus spears) as well as prepared paninis which they'll grill for you if you want  Try the white cheddar w/ truffled butter on sourdough- to die for  I get it EVERY time no matter what else may strike my fancy during my stay here (and I'm here for HOURS no exaggeration)  Beside and behind this deli counter are cases of pastries and pies charcuterie products and cheese  There is also a soup kiosk as well as a sandwich station  There is a self-serve dining section in this room w/ a couch or two and coffee table as well as bar-height tables and chairs and a couple of electric sockets to plug into while you utilize free wi-fi  While the sandwich maker will happily oblige you in slicing a loaf of bread you picked up from the many shelves and even toast a few slices for you to have w/ the half-pound of Tuscan chicken salad you sampled first at the deli counter make no mistake in thinking you'll be able to flag someone down as you dine at the self-service area  Once you pay for your items you're on your ownIf it's effusive service you want head over to the back of the restaurant where you'll find a wine bar to your left a lovely dining area in the middle and a bar counter to the right  There's even patio dining in the back but it was too cold to even consider that option then  You'll find live music between 6p and 9p on Friday nights  The times I spent there the group Slave to the Groove played  One of the two musicians used to be a chef :)  In between the sections of self- and full-service you'll find a coffee bar featuring Portland Roasting Company coffee where you may also purchase pastries such as muffins cookies and scones and to its right you will find the pizza/hot grill station where pizzaiolos/cooks busily prepare your pizzas burgers sandwiches or even roast prime rib while you wait  (The lay-out of TK is to me nicely done  I wish my home could feel like this  Oh and did I mention there is free wi-fi  Not hard to imagine that I've spent hours here now is it)Before I go on and on let me just list a few items I really enjoyed: 1 White cheddar panini w/ truffled butter $4 (don't forget to have it pressed)  Perfect w/ that $5 glass of wine during happy hour2 Prosciutto goat cheese fig and arugula bruschetta w/ aged balsamic vinaigrette- a great deal on their happy hour menu3 Apple crumble w/ vanilla-bean ice creamps  Their caffe latte is superb  I have it w/out sugar so that I can justify splurging on a cookie (or two)- the white chocolate macadamia nut or the oatmeal-raisin pairs up well  (I'd pass on the chocolate chip cookie- the chips used aren't of great quality IMHO)   Whether you're here for lunch happy hour coffee break or dinner you'll find The Kitchen a worthwhile choice  (Did I mention they also serve breakfast  Menu looks divine I haven't been but if someone sets up a breakfast UYE here I'll try my best to attend).
This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you Unfortunately for me I like to sleep I will never stay here again.
Place was clean and not busy at all for a Saturday Pizza was good compared to chucke e cheese.
The Phoenix open is a really good time and 75% of it comes down to the 16th hole For those that haven't been: It's a short par 3 that is fully enclosed by grandstand seating It seats a lot of people and it's very rowdy and VERY loud It is the least traditional golf environment you could imagine and it's a lot of funUpon teeing off the players are met with either rousing cheers or loud boos depending on where their tee shots land The crowd screams at the caddies trying to get them to sprint up onto the green If they ever do the crowd goes wild If there's a great shot the crowd goes wild Some golfers throw gear into the crowd and they go wild The moral of the story here is that it's wild There are private areas and spaces for corporate sponsors which would be the way to be here if you can find a way in When I come back next year I'll likely spend the vast majority of my time at the 16th hole It's so much fun and also a drunken shit show with all the lushes around youSome adviceGet here early because they'll start running a line While it's worth the wait to get in you'll enjoy it more if you don't have to wait Also bring/wear sunblock because regardless of where you sit you'll be in the sun pretty much all day.
This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix The pizza is wonderful the pesto salad is absolutely amazing and the fresh fruit crepe is delicious They have a great patio and I've never had bad service here even on busy nights The servers always remember my husband and me even though we don't go more than once every few months.
Blue Wasabi has become my new favorite sushi joint in town A very hip trendy sushi bar with young fun servers I was never a sushi fan but always loved the idea of "going out to sushi" With that said it's very important to me that a sushi restaurant offers a variety of non-seafood menu items I had The Clucker and The Bada Bing both wrapped in soy paper and they were both amazing We heard that Sundays were 1/2 alcoholic beverages if you wore a blue shirt so after church we actually drove home and changed our shirts before going but when we got there we heard the server offer the special to our neighboring table who weren't wearing blue It was a great experience and we will definitely be going back.
I had taken my boots in to have repaired They are Nine West Boots worn one season They had light distress to toe & heels They also need the heal caps replacedWhen I went back in to pick up the boots Im pretty sure they never touched them untill I walked in i waited 15 minutes The boots were "spray painted" not repaired stilll wet and he said they had to "air dry" Really shouldn't that already be done Also the price I paid was $10 more then I was quoted I would definitely not recommmend this company nor will I use them again.
WARNING do not go here I bought $15000 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere When I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them I used to go there all the time I will never go back Beware.
I have never eaten at El Pollo Loco before but decided to try them out today and get lunch for myself and coworkers  I went on their website which is easy to maneuver and found a nice catering menu  When I went to place my order it told me that because I didn't order 12 hours in advance I would need to call the store directly  I was worried they wouldn't be able to fill my order because I needed it in the next 2 hours but a very friendly man answered the phone and told me he could indeed have my order ready in time  I ordered 2 taquito platters which were very tasty and reasonably priced  When I went to the store to pick them up they also gave me extra tins for salsa from their salsa bar as well as plates and utensils  I definitely will be coming here again and I look forward to trying their other menu items.
MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT  HANDS DOWN  When friends/relatives come to visit this is the first place we go  I love the Two Tickets to paradise sandwich the chili verde birdie and the peach cobbler  LOVE LOVE LOVE FLANCERS.
Had one of my favorite breakfasts ever here while in Scottsdale last weekVery filling bowl of steak eggs and veggies Since switching to the Paleo diet eating out often leaves me unsatisfied but I could barely finish this breakfast and the taste was a 10 out 10I strongly recommend for the healthy on-the-go crowd.
stopped by here last friday night and still love it their beersstill good their pizzastill good at least 2 dozen visits since last review sostill good.
I've been here a couple of times with the BF and I've had a great time every time They have good food and I love how when the armrest is put up it feels like were watching a gigantic tv on our couch in the living room I love that we get to cuddle up super comfortably and munch on some fries and candy I learned my lesson about drinking too much before a movie having no recollection of the movie Immortals so I have since grown to love the whole movie and (1) drink concept Love the fact there aren't children and you can reserve your seats I haven't had any instances of dis-satisfactory service or technical difficulties so I can't give them any less of a rating The ticket prices are reasonable for all that you get I definitely think it's worth the extra couple of bucks It's fairly close to where we live making it more convenient than going to Studio Movie Grill but I have yet to try UltraStar Love the french fries here Will return many times over I'm sure.
Good brownies but horrendous customer serviceI placed 6 different orders online for Christmas presents They messed up 2 of them and then proceeded to insinuate I was a liar (customer service rep basically told me that over the phone) (Mistake 1) Ordered Winter sprite wonderland (package of sprites) - cost on website $3495 They sent a winter wonderland package - cost on website $2995 They didn't send me any sort of notification that they ran out of my item or that they would be sending an alternate item Usually when you do this you send an item of GREATER not LESSER value I emailed on a Wednesday about the mixup no response until I sent a followup email on Saturday Customer Service rep said that they did respond but couldn't prove it - she just got argumentative on the phone Basically she said that they have every right to send a replacement item even if it is of lower value and that this is posted on their website I couldn't find the notice on their website - but who sends a lower value item and then doesn't credit the difference They said I have to buy something else and they will credit the $4 difference to me on my next order NO apologies for the error just a stubborn attitude from Jennifer - the customer service rep No thanks Won't be buying from them ever againShe then couldn't assure me that the gifts I sent to others in my other orders were actually the correct gifts  I have my doubts based on them messing up 2 of my orders so will stay away from using them for gift orders ever again(Mistake 2) Had to change the shipping address on a order They did change the shipping address on that order correctly however they also mistakenly changed the address on another order (the order # is 2 digits off on the end) When I brought this up to them - again no response via email until I emailed twice They were nice enough to admit the mistake and then ship out a new package to the correct address However when I spoke to the customer service rep today - she basically said I lied on that order to get 2 packages of brownies shipped to me for the price of 1 and has emailed proof that I asked for the order address to be changed Yeah I asked for the address to be changed - ONLY on one order though and NOT both where they changed the address Customer service rep said she had the email where I asked for it but I don't have the email (and I have gmail where I can sort by the order number and see all emails with that # in the email body) and she basically just kept insinuating I was a liar Basically they erroneously changed the order shipping address on both orders instead of just 1 like I asked and now said it was my fault for the mistakeGood brownies but not worth the hassle and definitely not worth being treated like dirt Just wanted to make sure people knew how they treat customers.
Already a huge fan of Culinary Dropout and other Fox restaurants I was super-excited to try this place We had reservations so there was no wait The place has a very cool ambiance - nice but casual Everything we ordered was pretty amazing To start we split the roasted beet salad Delish My date had the Halibut and I had the Salmon Both were cooked perfectly and I would have licked my plate had it been appropriate We were done with our meal enjoying some wine (good selection by the way) and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting Even though there was now a wait at the door our server (who was awesome) made NO attempt to rush us out Excellent experience great food great service Can't wait to go back :).
Great fresh sauce and spicy pepperoni  Mozzarella tasted handmade and crust had the right thickness  Good pie.
This is a fun little place with an amazingly diverse menu and out-of-this-world food The beer list has everything from $2 Mickey's to gourmet brews The menu offers small light salad for me and grilled steak-filled sandwiches for my husband It has a fun and easy atmosphere with incredibly nice staff I have only been here a few times but it is becoming a new favorite.
Horrible placeI believe I saw Linda MacConnell  I was also put in a room and waited and waited someone from the staff opened the door and said I was put in the wrong room  Dr MacConnell laughed at the reason why I was there didn't give the medication I needed  I now I have ER bills thxs to her and a month and half has gone by based on her bogus findings  $45  to lie on a table and fall backwards to see my reflexes for 2 minutes what a joke.
Com tam thuan kieu rock my socks  It is the best com tam in AZ there is another one in santa anna and i've been there but it's not as good as this one prices are great but just stick to their Com tam don't expect them to have good pho when this place is all about com tam.
I decided to go to this restaurant because of my fellow online reviewers & unfortunately it's the first time I've felt let down  My boyfriend and I went to Su Vino winery right before they were closing & needed to find a new place to eat so I pulled up Trip Advisor & found F&B had amazing reviews  As we walked in I thought the place was really cute it was really eclectic & looked very down to earthWe sat down & were asking questions to the waitress because their drink menu is a bit confusing  She seemed a little impatient with us but then would go to the table next to us (an older couple) and be so friendly & nice seemed really odd  I got the impression that maybe she thought they would spend more & tip her better but we spent over $200 on our meal so I would think that deserves a little attention  I advise all younger patrons to try not to sit in the section of the early 30's blonde waitresses unless you want rude serviceThe food was not really that spectacular either  The ambiance gives you the impression of a farm fresh type cuisine but the steak we had was not impressive at all  Grass fed beef is really my favorite because it tends to just melt in your mouth but it didn't taste much better than something you would buy in the butcher section of your grocery store  We ordered the falafel (probably the best out of everything) sunchokes (very weird it almost tastes like a potato/artichoke & I definitely do not recommend this) it tasted very unhealthy & they gave you way too muchI would have to say that the absolute worst part for me was the dessert of all things this should be executed perfectly because that's the last thing you eat before you leave  I originally ordered the trip chocolate souffle cake & was sooooo excited what a joke  I have made souffle many times & it is very difficult but what they served was not souffle it tasted like they pulled an old dessert out of the refrigerator dumped Hershey syrup on it & served it  It was dense cold & dry YUCK  I took one bite & could not eat another after 20 minutes of our dessert sitting their uneaten the waitress finally came back to check on us & I ordered the Butterscotch Pudding (their signature dessert) & the waitress said "oh you decided to try that too"  She brought it out & then dropped off our check  Okay here's a little Serving 101 if somebody orders dessert & doesn't eat it & then orders another dessert you may want to ask if something was wrong  Not just ignore the table & then drop off the check to avoid having a conversation or to remove an item who does that  I then told her that I didn't like the dessert & to please remove it  After 25 hours a few courses $240 (with tip) later I was glad to leave  I will not be returning or recommending this place in the future in fact I've told a few people already not to waste their time in trying it.
I love this placethe staff is friendly and the prices are way better than whole foods or any other" organic" marketits got a good beer and wine selection and always fresh mini deli and olive barnever used itbut cool to sneak a snackthey have a really nice health and beauty selection as welltwo thumbs up and a wave.
This place is awesome I visited the shop after seeing it in passing a few times Any candy you could possibly ever want is here No joke Friendly atmosphere and more candy than anyone would know what to do with It is like a candy wonderland.
Love this place  We have stopped in here quite a few times since they have opened and always have a good time  It seems to be our Sunday Funday destination  The bar staff is friendly and personable (we love Heather Ashley and Dan)  The food is unique (sort of like upscale campfire food) and delicious  Oh and Bonfire has THE BEST MACARONI AND CHEESE in town  Hot and bubbly a Vermont White Cheddar mac and cheese that comes out in a mini cast iron skillet  It is simply amazing  I tried the Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger last night for the first time and it was fantastic  Very juicy and tasty  Hands down one of the best burgers I have had in Scottsdale.
I hit Portillo's drive thru today for a quick bite I was afraid to attempt driving while eating one of their incredible Italian Beef Sandwiches so I went with a Chicago Dog with everything fries and a diet coke They have the drive thru down to a fine art I sped thru there and in less than 3 minutes I was back on the road enjoying one of the best hot dog money can buy.
I've been going to Dr Miller for over 5 years  He is hands down the greatest dentist I have ever had  He is knowledgeable experienced technologically advanced and compassionate  Everybody who works in his office is very caring and friendly  I confidently and highly recommend Dr James Miller.
Very delicious Naples-style pizza This pizza is serious stuffVera Pizza Napolitana  Crust cheese ingredients--everything was tastyWe had the margharitta first and then we went crazy with Bufalo pizzaThe dough is like eating a cloud and it has the most perfect leopard spotting they cook it in less than two minutes and you can taste the complexity of the wood-fired oven styleThese people are PROSThe food was OUTSTANDING as was the wine selection I felt like my bill was very fair and will definitely be back when I'm in town again.
Blah and yuck Basically a buffet.

Great Place the bartender heather is a dream very helpfulFantastic beer selection and the food is pretty good also.
Best Fish And Chips Ever Seriously Don't pass this upThey also have a selection of different microbrews on rotation And of course nonstop Irish music for your listening pleasure.
This place is full of incompetent barbers  I recently went to Joe's for a haircut  The wait was long but stuck it out  It was finally my turn to go and the staff bumbled the list and called another gentleman's name before me  It was clearly on top of his but blatantly skipped  How can I trust a guy with my hair if he can't read a simple list.
My daughter signed a contract with Atlasta to do her wedding  They couldn't deliver on the things that they promised so they just canceled the contract  I heard some of their experienced staff have left the company and we were dealing with inexperienced people who have no concept of what a wedding should be  We wasted 5 months working with them and lost our deposit on the banquet hall  I heard from friends in the industry that this used to be a great catering company but is now going downhill  I'd be very careful dealing with Atlasta  If you want pain and anxiety you've got it  There are a lot of very good caterers and resorts who are just as good or better and so much easier to work with.
This review is for Alvadora - the spa at the Royal Palms [cue angelic voices**ahhhhhh**] The lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services When I arranged the appointment I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course' So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure The day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room Its not fair to call it a locker room its simply too lovely for that There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait DelightfulAs for the massage itself may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want I didn't want it to end The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol I think - was great I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me I felt perfectly taken care of My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need right down to qtips shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned All of that without drugs The showers walk in and large enough for a family of 5 are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy Lovely As an aside I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself It was pleasant in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary And sorry my lovely but not worth 80+ dollars There are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did Menu lunch it all comes to you quickly sweetly happily Makes me wish I lived there Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself The staff is kind and attentive and a dot on the i of the incredible experience.
My husband and I went to Grimaldi's last night and there was a bit of a wait for a table so we grabbed two seats at the bar After the bartender Hannah talked to us we decided to stay there to eat She was super attentive and really friendly and the bar was actually more quiet than the main restaurant We had a bottle of the Layer Cake Primitivo shared a salad and had a pizza with red peppers and meatballs The pizza (as always) was cooked perfect Love their thin crust and fresh mozarella The manager heard that we had a young baby at home so he came over to talk about his kids and ours with us He even comped our dessert Both he and the bartender were really engaging and fun to talk to without being overbearing They made our experience a wonderful night out--which is important when you only get one a week We've been there with a big group as well and got our own little dining room that felt like we were all together at someone's home (without having to have someone cook or pick up).
This is a great shop  Stopped in a few nights ago just as they were closing  I was trying to hurry and look at everything so I staff could get out of there on time  But they were super cool and said they still had lots to do and take our time  I bought a really cute necklace - its a tiny wishbone on a very thin thread that you are to wear until it falls off and then your wish will come true - how cute is that  Wonderful wine racks too  I love this place.
So many great accessories and cute clothes I got my accessories for my Wedding here and they were perfect Everything from clutches to earrings from cute tops to watches they have everything color coordinated.
The best  I had my 2008 Land Rover to the dealer for service a couple months ago and was told there were several things that needed to be fixed ASAP  With very low mileage on the vehicle I was skeptical  I looked up garages on Yelp and came across Dave's  He went over the car with a fine tooth comb and gave it a clean bill of health and didn't charge me a dime  He has a customer for life.
Mongolian BBQOn the NW corner of Thomas & 15th AvenueLove this place  If you go here get the Stir Fry in the frontI love to add my own ingredients into my bowl which they take from you & stir it all up with the sauce of your choice Very hearty lots of food Always hot & fresh Very friendly.
Wow  So I just got home from my first "foot massage" I was very surprised at the level of service I read reviews so I had an idea that they started with your head and arms then went to your feet But didn't realize it was also face and then after the feet a full back massage  I was a little surprised when my masseuse climbed on my back but it was well worth itI originally came here because my feet were numb after a weekend of dancing in 6" heels in Miami - and now I don't think I will ever go to a "normal" massage place again  I am totally hooked.
Pure and utter dog poop Asked for an "Anaheim Scramble" with some orange juice The cashier told me they didn't have juice I asked if they were out She replied no and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place My scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me I ask her why she looked at it that way she said no reason I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchenWhat she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast  See picture for further reference.
I just tried this restaurant for the first time It was delicious I ordered the raw vegan sushi and a raw dessert I thoroughly enjoyed my dish and I also tasted my dates dish which was the raw wrap and that too was yummy Great service nice clean atmosphere I will be returning many more times BTW I am a raw vegan and have been a vegan for 8 years so I have tried my fair share of vegan and raw vegan restaurants.
What a great place Went to a wine tasting there Great wine and food Atmosphere fun check it out.
PAM is a terrific museum and it just keeps getting betterCheck out the Sassoon Ivories.
We recently went on a Friday night (the museum is free on Friday and Saturday nights right now)  The museum is very small but always has something interesting on display We especially enjoyed the Video Works exhibit  Always a great place to see some unusual art.
Where can you go in Arizona to get the best cheesesteak   here of course sure the lines are long at times but totally worth the wait  Aside from the perfect amount of whiz on your sandwich there are a plethora of adds to throw on to create the perfect sammich like like like.
Hip hotel with very friendly staffLarge pool that I'm sure is packed during warmer months Be sure to request a room that doesn't face the pool to avoid the noise late into the night of people socializing in the hot tubTrader Vics restaurant home of the mai-tai- is affiliated with the hotel and they made us a dinner reservation to celebrate a special event Though the place was dead on a Friday night (seasonal resort) the joyful staff made up for the lack of vibe and the food was amazingThe spa and gym are way above average I had the gym all to myself one morning and they have new workout equipment to "get it done" It also faces the pool so you can stare off at the bikini bods while burning those mai-tais on the treadmillIt's also walking distance into old town Scottsdale and a 5 minute drive the the enormous Fashion Square mall.
I have been to this place about 15 times and each time I have gotten the roasted turkey and stuffing (their specialty) and it is so good I have not tried any other sandwich that they make I'm sure their other sandwiches are good but when I go in there to eat and I see people ordering and eating other sandwiches and it actually kind of infuriates me to the point where I have to take deep breaths and refrain myself from getting in right in their face and screaming "What the %$#& is your problem Why aren't you eating the roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich" I was there today and some chick ordered a quesadilla Again I am sure the quesadilla is good but seriously you need an MRI AND a taste buds transplant if you order a F$%#ing quesadilla at an amazing sandwich joint like this The cold turkey compliments the warm stuffing perfectly with just the right amount of mayo on the sandwich The sausage stuffing is out of this world good I wish they sold their stuffing in huge containers to take home so I could dump it in my bathtub and bathe in it nightly.
I went to see Dr Garza for a simple checkup It turns out he was able to spot problems under some old silver fillings and was able to clear out the decay and replace with new white fillings I don't know how all my other exams and the dentists reviewing my X-rays could have missed it  Dr Garza spotted the damage and took care of it right away without the need for another appointmentDr Garza is true professional who cares enough about his clients to give the best care possible I am definitely recommending him to all my friends and family.
I've eaten here a few times it's always been good Love the sushi num num num Must try the short ribs so yummy Thanks everyone at Kabuki.
No signage at all A bit pricey CASH only Limited hours horrible parking no indoor seating and competition for shaded seating on the half-dozen picnic tables of the back patio in this residential neighborhood Expect the line to be out the door and you are probably going to have to wait a minute to get your lunch because this is the best damn hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in the valley If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience this is it Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips but I've never seen nachos on the menu Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class assuming you like this class If it's the middle of the week like between 11 - 4 I've got a $20 bill and a hankering for Mexican Al Fresco - Rito's Who's down.
Most post offices are the embodiment of government inefficiency Understaffed bleary grumpy workers limited and inconvenient hours zero point zero customer service effort lines fifteen people deep you know the drillThe Van Buren post office is a small gift from God because it's TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE They have extended hours rad for those of us with actual jobs that keep us occupied between 8 am and 5 pm They are always fully staffed with real live smiling helpful people who seem to enjoy their jobs More than once they've helped me figure out a cheaper way to send stuff and have even helped me jam stuff into smaller boxes to save some cash The self-serve kiosk is always fully stocked and functional Plus my local Arcadia location is like a depressing United Nations gathering full of depressed-looking people who appear wasted and/or haven't showered in four days The Van Buren location is usually pretty empty but once there were a couple of teenagers trying to send live chickens through the mail which was pretty awesome.
Five Dive Bar StarsLove this place  have been coming here since I discovered their amazing 80s night (Shadowplay) 3ish years agoMy first night here was definitely  a religious experience  Was blown away when I heard what the DJ was spinning the soundtrack to my life  David Bowie Morrissey The Smiths Depeche Mode The Cure Joy Division The Specials Nitzer Ebb and Front 242 and the list goes on  So yes DJ Manchester rules  How could you not when you've named yourself after the music capital of Universe  With the bars eccentric Viper Room-esque  punk rock vibe this place makes me feel like I'm at a modern day GBGBs     Awesome regulars and bar staffHave made the BEST of friends at this Venue This has become a favorite local hangout for so manythere is literally something going on every night of the weekFrom their kick ass band nights (tributes and rockabilly galore) to their ridiculously fun DJ Dance nights to the midweek mellow Motown/ska/ or anything goes nites --this place is a freakin gem Not to mention the bartenders are extremely friendly with their POURS ha and they have the coldest Blue Moon on Earth   Love love love Rippin it up & getting Ripped at Rips.
Excellent food and friendly service  Excellent value and great atmosphere.
So I'd like to start by first saying that I did NOT use Safelite but was so appalled on the phone that I would never even think about it I called the main number on their Web site to get information and I was connected to some inbound call representative Firstly they wouldn't give me a quote until they asked me a lot of questions many of which had nothing to do with what the chip repair would cost Secondly they tried to say it would cost $10100 for a chip repair I was so shocked because I once replaced an entire windshield for $11000 so I would never spend that much for a repair I told her that it was outrageous and nevermind then she said "Ok I can do $7500" I told her too high and no thank you so then I had to hear a lecture about how their apoxy is clear and such great quality and on and on I called a few other companies and am very happy that I can go with Guardian Auto Glass who will come to my house for $4495 + tax.
I took my father here for dinner because I had heard so many good things about it The restaurant was relatively slow when we arrived We were sat by a very friendly hostess and waters were promptly delivered Then we sat at our table for over 15 minutes without receiving any further service I had to ask the hostess to find our waitress for us  Once they finally came over and took our order they hardly seemed apologetic for the neglect In addition to having to wait so long to even place our order they forgot my order when the food finally arrived I will not take anything away from the quality of their food but the service is less than up to standard Id recommend getting take out.
We stopping in on Saturday Sept 1 at about 2:PM the sign said they closed in the afternoon and reopened for dinner a couple of hours later Since we were there about 15 minutes before the closing time and just wanted a sandwich we went in There were about 4 employees at the counter working on prep for dinner and about three other customers No one greeted us but they had to have seen us you just can't miss someone standing at the front door Eventually we just sat outselves Still no one would make eye contact or approach us My partner went to the counter and got a menu and the woman at the counter said she didn't see us She would have to be blind not to have seen us We ordered a sandwich from the self service counter It was not impressive just meat and cheese on bread with lettuce The potato salad was nice but a pretty small portion for the price We definetly felt unwanted If you want to strart prepping for dinner at 1:30 then close at 1:30.
Charged us $15 for a small fast food Food wasn't good and based on the place and the quality plates should be $6 not $15 That's what you would expect to pay for a really nice food and a nice restaurant in Phoenix.
SUPER RUDE - DON'T EVEN GOI have been going here for about 6 years now their pho and spring rolls and egg rolls are absolutely delicious one of the ladies here is super rude every time though Yes for the entire time I've been going here she has been an absolute b*tch she is a small thin chinese woman with a boy cut hair cut and is always very rude and mean again the food is great and everyone else is nice but I've just had it with dealing with her I made an order to go today and asked for fish sauce she put peanut sauce when I got there I asked for cups for chili sauce and she just shooed me off and told me it was all already in there when I got home all that was in there was a tiny thumbnail size of chili and they didn't even include a lime or lemon with my pho Again I'm just done with this place and will not be going back - don't waste your time either there are plenty of other pho places that will actually treat you with respect and courtesy for the same price and in the same area (one is over on 17th ave and camelback)Maxim you have lost a loyal long time customer and I will never recommend your restaurant to my friends ever again That woman is the rudest person I've ever came across in the food service industry  - I'm amazed if you don't lose more customers because of her.
I've been here before and brought a friend for the first time raving about the place  He won't go back  We had very poor service  We ordered one appetizer one entree and one dessert and split the meal and it took over 2 hours  We watched other couples come and go and even when we asked we were told someone would be with us right away  We did have reservations also  The atmosphere is always lovely and the food was generally good but after having such poor service even the good food wouldn't win me over to come back again.
I have an 18 month old Great Dane who has recently become very finicky during meal times Sometimes she would eat all or half and other times she would eat nothing (She was on Eagle Pack Large/Giant breed) A few days went by where she wouldn't even touch her foodSo off I went to Bark Avenue to hunt down another food that would be good for my giant breed The women that helped me was SO helpful She was very knowledgeable about what kind of protein and fat content giant breeds need and gave me some free samples to try out with her to see which she liked best She even took the time to walk around to the different foods she recommended and fed her Bernese mountain dogs Needless to say I was very impressed and will be back very soon to purchase a bag of whatever food my baby likes best Thanks Bark Avenue.
I freaking love The Good Egg It's a great straight up no frills breakfast place It almost reminds me of the diners back home in NY You can pretty much get eggs any way you want them along with all sorts of other breakfast goodies (They have inventive/creative options)  In my experience the service has been great and the food is inexpensive I wish there was a place like this in Boston but alas I will just keep pining away for it until I move And the 6th free entree "Best Thing In Life" card is sweet.
Experienced hummus xpress for the first time tonight and truly enjoyed the experience The staff was very friendly and helpful and guided me through making my dish The food was great I am a fairly picky person and was pleased to find that I loved it Definitely recommend.
I love korean food but I love cheap delicious korean food even more They have variuos rice bowls on the menu and some platter options I haven't tried yet The bolgogi bowl is very tasty and with the yelp check in offers we also got 2 free refreshing iced green teas The place is clean and has a back/side area with more seating I still have to go and check out their other bowls and happy hour so there will definitely be an update.
The manager and owner of this establishment needs to be reprimanded for his disregard for basic health and safety practices in his store  The manager accidentally spilled burning hot coffee on my brother today at the register  Instead of tending to my brother's burnt leg he simply wiped up the spill on the counter and offered up a weak apology   I worked at Starbucks for 6 years and I would never tend to a small counter spill before I offered up a wet cloth or burn cream to a customer who had been burned  Especially if the spill was my fault My concern for the employees who work here and customers who frequent this spot (which will no longer be me) is that there was no proper first aid to treat his burn  When my brother asked for something for his burn the manager dug around for a bit before producing a bottle of NIVEA BOTANICAL HAND CREAM  At this point I approached the register and asked what they had in their first aid to treat burns because Nivea hand cream was not acceptable for his burnt leg  He returned to the first aid kit and offered my brother a tube of antibacterial soapThis should be of great concern to the friendly people who work there and to the loyal customers who visit  Please consider that all food and beverage establishments should have at the bare minimum a BASIC first aid kit that includes burn cream  This manager should sincerely hope that none of his employees are burned or injured at this establishment because he would have a serious lawsuit on his hands  Same goes for his customers.
I have been a fan of Frost since they opened their second store in Tucson near Sabino Canyon I don't think there is a better Gelato place ever And I mean Ever I was so desperate to find out when they were opening one in Phoenix that I actually emailed them They promptly informed me that they DO have a Frost open now and its in Gilbert Umm Yeah that's only a 25 minute drive for me from Ahwatukee but hey who cares At least I don't have to drive allll the way to Tucson to get my Gelato fix Not that I mindbut anywayso here we goand have been 3 times in the last 4 weeks Do I even have to tell you how amazing this place is The more times we go the more people are standing in line to get a piece of this heaven I love the fact that they go around and serve water as you are experiencing your gelato Makes it go down much better I think The girls and guys that work there are phenomenal actually look you in the eye when greeting and talking to you and always have a smile on their face Why wouldn't they they are selling happiness :).
My husband says this spot has the best original Philly Cheesesteak in AZ The sandwiches have a large amount of steak and the bread is moist Great sandwiches and you gotta try the "fry" sauce We'll definitely be back.
I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like PF Chang's But this place is the worst both food and service The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well Funny story was I was talking to my boss about Chinese restaurant and he mentioned Iron Chef where he took his family We ended up talking and find out we were treated the same way from the same guy We laughed it off and made joke about it all the time now.
Me and my Wife loved it Went for Cinco De Mayo and had great drinks and food Sat at the bar and had great service We will be coming back.
I love love love everything about Liberty Market Everything from the staff to the food and their selection of wine and beer I'm a frequent diner at Liberty Market and while you can usually find me there for their amazing breakfasts during the week I'm also a huge fan of dinner as well especially since they mix up the menu on the weekends and usually have something different every weekIf you have a chance get your butt out here It's amazing (PS My faves: Cortado and the demi-breakfast with a blueberry pancake and bacon Yummy).
Great food and at an affordable price $25 fed my family of 5 :) And my wife loved it"It's just what I have been looking for And it hit the spot".
This is the best bike shop hands down in the Phoenix area  They are professional and I always get great customer service  They stick to their word even when things come out slightly more expensive than they said  They never pressure you.
Love this place  If you cant find the candy that you want here it does not exist.
WELL Being the caffeine junkie that I am I feel that it is about time to review another Starbucks Went here a few hours ago picking up a hot latte to help me concentrate on prepping for a speech tomorrow (Those Vanilla Lattes really get the job done)Anyway Walked in said hello the employees who were all cheery and friendly Plenty of laughs and small talk which is nice I like that comforting small talk makes me feel like I'm not customer 456554 just  waiting for an overpriced latte I'm "Wesley" on that Venti cardboard cup and that's what I was called No sir's here Also wasn't too crowded yay Five whole stars for Starbucks PV Mall you guys earned it.
paid over $600 to get out this place yes it sucks when the personal trainer says I have $XX promotion when the corporate rejects as there is no promotion quoted in the contract Just avoid this place.
Ahwatukee we scored  Yes a Pita Jungle in our own neighborhood  Went tonight with husband and some friends the food AMAZING the service EXCELLENT  A special thank you to Tanisha our server  She made some great recommendations and answered all our needs tonight  Welcome to the neighborhood Pita Jungle.
Friendly & sweet service Spacious rooms An indoor is a plus in heat of desert metropolis.
I have been looking for a good Jamaican restaurant for a long time specifically one that has beef patties and home made sorrel  I used to live in New York and they were easy to find there but not in AZ I found this restaurant on Yelp last weekend and decided to take the whole family after looking at the menu online It was a Monday so we were able to get the jerk chicken plate for $5 for the lunch special My husband loved the chicken and so did my 5 year old It had just the right amount of spice My 2 year old loved the rice and peas I was very excited that they had home made sorrel as it wasn't listed on the online menu It was amazing I ordered a beef patty and a chicken patty both were good but the chicken patty was definitely better The staff is extremely friendly and made sure to give us coupons for the next time we come back I am now recommending this restaurant to anyone I know that enjoys Jamaican food Get up and go You won't be disappointed.
Called them and scheduled a pick up at downtown phoenix at 2:50pm  I stressed that they need to be on time because I need to make it to the airport on time  The driver arrived 8 minutes early and told me he'll wait and I can just come out at 2:50pm  Very very courteous guy  The ride to the airport was smooth and it cost wayyy cheaper than SkyHarbor cab  Very good experience will use their service again if I"m in Phoenix.
This place is awesome I had never been but stopped by after needing scrubs for school The girl working was very helpful and offered to clear my hands and start me a fitting room right away They have great prices and everything was easy to find Was also very excited when she told me $1499 and $999 items were 50% off that day I bought 4 scrub tops and two bottoms for only $40 I asked for business cards and received a calendar that let's me know what deals they have on each day I would definitely recommend them and already have to my classmates.
The kids that work here are extremely unsanitary They are rude and just plain don't care  To be honest I love subway but this store is gross The owner needs to fire the kids working here Lets be real making a sub is not rocket science The other subway in town is 1000 times better I'm still pissed that the kids knowningly gave me really old bread that I only discovered when I got home I had to throw the subs in the trash I was afraid I would get sick Punk kids wasted $10 that I work hard for Never again will I go here.
In the age of credit cards debit cards online and mobile banking I don't find myself going much further than the ATM when it comes to going to the bank  However  Once in a great while I do find myself needing to go inside the bank to use a service or see a teller and this branch actually makes me miss those good old days of human interactionThe employees are really friendly  The kind of friendly where in the couple of minutes it took to withdraw money into a cashier's check I think the teller and manager knew my whole life story  I'm not really a conversationalist when it comes strangers but they always manage to break me out of shell.
Greg() had my car running smoothly in a snap Thank you so much.
I recently moved to Phoenix and needed to find a new salon after going to the same high-end place in Glendale  Well yelpers the reason I went to Ide Mania was more than just because it was down the street  The great reviews from previous clients lured me to the salon  I had a great haircut from Lettie  She nailed it the first time  I'm going to become a regular  Love the salon and the Aveda products they use  The owner even came up and introduced herself and welcomed me and made me feel at home  Love this place  Thanks for being there Ide Mania  I'll be seeing you.
El Chorro is my favorite spot for Sunday brunch  I ordered the omelette of the day served with potato cake/hash browns roasted tomatoes and a giant english muffin the best breakfast I've had in a long time  Not to mention their complementary sticky buns  As if that wasn't enough the atmosphere is unbeatable  Shade misters and an exquisite view.
Wow  This could possibly be the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant  First they seated us in a back room that had a completely different ambience from the main dining room this was like a bad addition with high-watt fluourescent spotlights and rickety tables crammed into the corners surrounding a party of ~20  The worst part however was the insanely loud party of Scottsdale douchebags that were having some sort of party in the room  The staff acted like they didn't even notice and made no attempt to quiet them I'm talking slamming on tables screaming across the room at one another and just general douchebaggery  The food was mediocre the appetizers were cold and my pork chop was certainly nothing special  Do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.
So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA How-EVA our experience was not fabulous It was more like DRAB-ulous Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink The server did not offer to bring me something different he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that Hmmmm There were a MILLION specials It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list It was baffling The prices are NOT cheap We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters Well they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood but definitely not pork All the server said was "Well it listed the chorizo on the menu"- Hmmmmmm Again we just kept them Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand At this point we had already ordered the mushroom toast points but after the oyster debacle we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms totally overcooked and unappetizing We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to "do anything" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth) Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check however there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp  Again I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future Well that didn't happen perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares we are well known so whatever Well whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts plus now I have written a poor review and all my FB friends know about it too I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again Such a shame Customer service is dead these days SIghHope it was worth the $30 bucks guys.
Bought the Groupon for 15 visits and have loved it This is a great place to get a good sweat on Len the owner always mixes up the exercises and comes up with creative new things for us to try The workouts are circuits- you rotate through stations and do each exercise for about 40-60 seconds I like that because just when my mind starts to tell me I can't do it anymore the bell rings and I know I only have ten more seconds that I need to push through Each day of the week has a different focus:Monday- combo day (whole body workout)Tuesday- focus on chest/shouldersWednesday- butt/legsThursday- biceps/tricepsFriday- absSaturday- combo dayYou have to sign up for classes online ahead of time which has actually turned out to be great accountability for me- I know that I have to go because I will be charged regardless plus I took someone's spot (don't worry you can cancel up to an hour before if something comes up) Overall this has been a great experience and a great way to get in shape The other girls are nice and everyone is so focused on their own exercise that nobody judges anyone else I would highly recommend Jabz.
A hidden treasure up on Pinnacle Peak & Pima  The pizza is quite possibly the best in town  It is cooked to perfection with lots of cheese & ample toppings  If your not in the mood for pizza their sandwiches are excellent as well  Also the staff is always friendly  I'm not sure why Paul didn't like it  Everybody I've talked to loves the pizza & I've often heard comments like it's better than other pizza places in the area (like Rosati's & Barro's) which I have to agree.
I have been eating at Crackers for years and I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad meal  Their food is so friggin good that i'm craving it right now as I type  From breakfast (sirloin or california eggs benedict are my two faves) to lunch (any salad or soup is great and of course the best sandwich ever - Roast Beef Avocado Melt) to dessert (world famous Bread Pudding and the ever so chocolaty Kahlua Brownie) you cant go wrong great atmosphere  Always packed  great service.
I used AOA about a month ago for some group team building activities  I have to say I was very impressed from day one with the service they provided  Bernard was able to work with me on my time budget and activity needs to come up with 2 different activities for the group  We did the Team Orienteering and the comination of building a bike for charity & then a bike ride in the dessert  The Mountain biking activity was a HUGE hit the Team Orienteering wasn't a big hit but that wasn't the fault of AOAit just wasn't a good fit for my group  When I called Bernard a few days out to say that I needed to make sure my CEO had a hard bike ride he assured me Seth would take care of him  As is turned outSeth gave our CEO a private ride which he loved and talked about for the duration of the conferenceAOA had helpful friendly staff and excellent equipment  All the staff seemed to really be excited about what they do and helping out-of-towners enjoy themsleves  In the end our CEO was happy and the attendees really enjoyed themselveswhich made me happyI hope to be able to work with AOA again in the future.
I usually love Einsteins  I love their blackberry lemonade and their six cheese bagels  However I do not love this location  It is right around the corner from my house I do not even have to leave my residential roads to enter here but I will never go here again  Why do you ask  It is because they have the worst customer service ever  Every time I have been in here (which is about 6-7) they are very rude to me  I do not know why  I do not know if they are having a bad day or what but they are extremely unfriendly here and its not always the same person They lost my business for good.
Chino is one of those secret places that is anything but a secret  It has been featured on the Food Network Diners Dives and Drive-ins and for good reasonPicture this scene-I am moving from Tulsa to Phoenix for a new Job My future boss wants me to meet him at some run down shopping center for lunch before I even start work I am in town to look at houses in 2005 (yes I got screwed and paid way too much)  So I roll up to this place and think I made a mistake but after having a lunch there I was and am hooked on Chino for life I now live in San Diego but when I go back to see my upside down house I must stop in at Chino You should toowell not the house part The place has the best most unique food of anywhere I have been Asian-mexican fusion  I guess maybe but fusion connotes some sense of sophistication Chino is fantabulous but for goodness sake dinner is served in an aluminum freaking bowl Sophisticated it is not The tables are reminiscent of a bingo hall long with crappy chairs In a location like this the food has to be good or they will end up like the other tenants around them-here today and gone tomorrow Now the food-fantastic  Jade Red chicken is their most popular Think sweet-n-sour but with a spiced red sauce and not nearly as tough to chew  It will be mixed with some brand of rice you choose on the menu such as chicken fried jerk fried white etc My favorite is the Emerald Chicken made up of tender chicken slices with a fantastic green sauce made of Ginger garlic oil and other mysterious but yummy ingredients You pick your meal from an order card you grab inside the door Take a red pen and circle the stuff you want  Yep kinda weird but they can help sort you out at the counter if you need it There is a wall with photos of each meal but it appears to have been taken in 1963 then placed in the Phoenix sun for a few years Forget it Just ask or look around They do have samples which help Oh to make it more confusing there is a secret menu of sorts too such as the 7-11 I don't even know what it is but my buddy digs it the most The grub is great and they finish nicely with a phenomenal fatty sugar cookie No one and I mean no one says anything bad about the cookie Go try this place It is worthy of 6 stars.
I hate this foresaken place To go from one terminal to the other you have to walk for two days and get blisters on the palms of your feet It has the worst set up no trams what so ever the waiting areas are tiny tiny tiny there is no where to sit you see tons of people sitting on the floor Not a lot of places to eat either and the restaurants all serve their beer in plastic cups how classy is that for a $10 beer I can't rate check in or security check thru's because I only experienced a connecting flight but my experience was a 0 star nightmare.
Mucho Gusto has the Best Fish Tacos in town From the moment you are greateted at the door you can feel the lively energy that radiates from this place Great tunes & great ambiance with a friendly & hip staff If you need a thirst quencher for the Hot summer Mucho Gusto has the most delicious Margaritas & Iced Tea to cool you off I will for sure be returning to this place soon to get my fish taco fix.
If you like inattentive service than this joint is for you You want your burger to look like it got into a brawl in the back than this joint is for youYou want to wait  10 minutes after you sit down for your drink order to be taken then this joint is for youOh no run away then and hope the other resturants opening up in terminal 4 open soon.
Well done food in a welcoming environment  Despite the conference lunch crush the staff was efficient and friendly with very minimal wait times  I had the tortilla soup which was fantastic.
One of my favorite spots in Phoenix The service is always excellent and the bruschetta is delicious Some favorite bruschetta choices are Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese and Burrata Bacon Arugula & Tomato Happy hour offers $5 wines although ends early at 5pm.
The person above with 'duplicate review' has a link to a different restaurant  This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th StCorkage byobThis is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol but you can bring your own sake wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in)  Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi always fabulous specials on the board and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi  Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes  Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi even if it isn't on the short menu  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available amazing flavor and texture very japanese  mmmmNot open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday closed on Mondays  Regular hours through the week.
I'm so glad my hubby and I decided to stop by and check this place out Laura who is one of the owners was very welcoming and pleasant We had a couple of flights and were very pleased The wines Laura carries are very reasonably priced and unique She is very knowledgeable of the wines she has in her shop which makes the experience all that much better.
I love this place  I was on the hunt for the perfect ring for my woman  I walked in and was greeted promptly but it wasn't an immediate "Here buy our jewels" kind of deal  The folks behind the counter let me come to them and weren't pushy thank God cause I probably would have left  They have really beautiful stuff here some new and some estate  I found "the ring" several months ago but didn't make the purchase until after I had a few visits with it  I wanted to make sure it was right  They remembered who I was when I first came back and that means a lot to me When I made my final payment earlier this week the lady was almost as excited as me  I love supporting the local folk and I hope that if and when you want some new bling you'll give this place a shot.
Michelle Duvall is amazing  I love my nails  She did a pink and white back fill and I'm not the easiest cline to please  I normally go home and refile my nails the way I want them done  I like thatshe was punctual and even finished me in less then 50 min  I pre poked my next appointment and am sending my friends to her  Thanks Michelle.
The Thai Basil was delicious and reasonably priced  Very quick service highly recommended.
I have been here quite a few times and i have to say i never get tired of it The wine and Bruschetta Special is the best for only $20 during certain times The environment is chill and welcomingI recommended to anyone looking for that something different.
When I first went to the room store I thought it was awesome The sales guy tommy offered me a great deal on my new mattress a hundred off the bed free delivery and a free mattress protector I've had the mattress set for a month now mattress isn't that great and doesn't feel like the one in store That's not the real issue though I applied for financing on it and got my first bill yesterday The total was supposed be a little under 700 but when I opened the bill is was almost a thousand dollars I called the room store talked to several managers including the store manager and all he had to say on the matter was that I got charged for the mattress protector delivery and the hundred off the bed wasn't taken off I didn't even want the mattress protector in the first place but I figured since it was free I'd take it After about an hour and a half all he offered to do was give me the mattress protector for free but still charge me the delivery and not fix the price on the bed I continued to fight with him about the deal I had made he said he'd call me back in an hour with more of what he could do Still no call back from him I'm about ready to return it It's not comfortable especially not $1000 comfortable I will never shop there again and neither will my family He lost out on a lot of business especially since I'm moving and need a living room set and some furniture pieces for my room Save yourself the time and agony and don't go there The "amazing deals" they offer are all smoke and mirrors.
Short security lines friendly personnel and free wifi I frequent many airports and pHX ranks pretty high.
I love this theater  It's so brand new and sparkly.
Can't get more authentic than this Polish family runs the place and makes all their own meats and sausage They carry many crackers condiments and other imported goods from Poland etc They also make a decent sandwich for 5 or 6 bucks Warning Cash only.
I had lunch here today with my mom and I was pleasantly surprised The food is really good and reasonably priced Of course we had to try a cupcake so we split a cookie dough cupcake and it was to die for I can't wait to go back and try another flavor The staff is really nice but honestly my favorite part was the music - Elliott Smith Beck Radiohead Beatlesit doesn't get any better than that for me I could have sat there all day listening to my favorite music while eating delicious cupcakes :).
After reading the reviews about this place I just had to go and check it out There was alot of people but not overcrowded it was alot of families and there kids The food was awesome I had the fundido with jalapeno cream cheese and it was so good It had this awesome unique taste to it where you just couldnt stop eating even when full This was the only place that makes there mexican rice exactly like my moms It was delish You can tell there refried beans were very authentic Ive been to alot of mexican restaurants and this one is by far the best.
Met 2 friends here for lunch and the place just keeps getting better The hot and sour soup was amazing Filled with lots of roast pork shrimp tofu and veggies with the perfect amount of spice I just wish I lived closer The prices have gone up a bit but $599 & $699 is still a bargin for the quality and quantity of food.
Great bank Very nice employees although a slightly weird location Its located in Scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall I came in they printed me checks really quickly and called it a day Thanks everyone.
My partner and I needed two new tires and an alignment We have a Chevy Cobalt and its only two years old Went to the dealership and they wanted almost $700 out the door We came to S&S and they gave all that for less than half the price They were kind courteous and did not treat us badly for being gay It was a great experience.
I agree with everything that Max A said about this place  I went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call  If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar then this place is for you  If you like bad hair white belts and crappy tattoos this is also right up your alley  I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them  I won't be going back here its just depressing.
I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way) It can get really busy at lunch so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work I did that once and got in and out just fine but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch Everything is delicious but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must.
All of my friends were asked what we want to drink the second we got in the door: They wouldn't let my friends nds who walked in together each have their own tab We had to use one card and break it later Then one girl wouldn't USE my tab: she had the gall to say she' isn't psychic' and said I have to tell her I want to use my tab before I order Ive never purchased ANYTHING where I have to say how I want to pay before I order it Pretty terrible and annoying experience overall.
While I've been to both Houston's and Bandera multiple times last night was my first visit to Hillstone the umbrella responsible for all of them Let's just say I'll be hard pressed to go anywhere but Hillstone from now on There was a wait so we started on the outdoor patio for a drink The outdoor space is really amazing Cool lights unique furniture and overall a great ambiance I ordered a Maker's Manhattan rocks and the drink was perfectSo often Manhattans are "over Vermouthed" this one was the perfect blend and let the Whiskey speak for itselfEven the ice cubes looked cool The restaurant is large spacious and has a cool design It's very Frank Lloyd Wright esque We sat at a booth toward the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and prep bar Service was prompt and friendly as I've come to expect at any Hillstone restaurantAs for the food it was delicious As a table we ordered the Hawaiian rib eye x2 (ridiculous mine was a perfect medium rare and delicious) the French Dip and the Prime rib All meals were well received even the salads were delicious The menu is really similar to Houston's (read: nearly identical) so you know what you're getting intoIt's not cheap but it's absolutely worth it Hillstone is on my list for a return trip ASAP.
Thank you Fuego for continuing to serve outstanding food I came for dinner on Saturday and had the short rib and I ate myself in to a coma The food is fantastic the service is stellar and the patio is bustling and cozy now that the weather is cooling down I continue to recommend this place to friends and family and I am always glad I did.
08/30/12Was here for Stephen Chbosky's Q&A and book-signing event for _the perks of being a wallflower_  I've only been to three book-signing events and the two most-fun ones were held here  My first ever was Elizabeth Gilbert's _Eat Pray Love_ event which was VERY engaging and entertaining so I had a feeling that Chbosky's event would be just as pleasing  The space was packed with an eclectic mix of teenagers young adults and professor-types  I suspect a large percentage of the audience were writers themselves individuals who aspire to become writers or are curious to learn more about the creative processes of writing acting and directing  The author was funny very approachable empowering and confident  and yet very humble  The long excerpt he read was from an audience member's well-used book with a jacket that did not resemble any of the two current ones (a lemon-yellow one and a movie cover)  After the reading Chbosky opened the floor to questions each of which he answered in depth and with a lot of humor  At one point a young mother had to rock and coo her baby to stop fussing but the author immediately put her at ease with an "oh no don't worry" and that he had a three-week old daughter at home and so knew what the mother was going through so "just let the baby cry and do her thing"  I thought it fantastic how he encouraged aspiring writers to not listen to those who limited their creative processes but to find their own ways their own voices with which to express their thoughts  Questions were asked on what inspired him to write certain poems in the book (the protagonist Charlie writes poems and diary entries that address the audience members as if they were reading the entries themselves as opposed to being narrated to) how it was to direct certain scenes and what it was like to work with the cast which included Emma Watson (Hermione in the Harry Potter movies) Logan Lerman (D'Artagnan in 2011's The Three Musketeers) and Ezra Miller (Kevin in We Need to Talk About Kevin)  He even had a lovely mention regarding actor Paul Rudd's participation in the movie I am looking forward to seeing the film which is coming out next month  :)I was first attracted to this book which I've yet to read when I caught the movie's trailer a few weeks ago and was frozen in my tracks upon hearing the honest eye-opening quote one of the author's favorite lines he's written to date:"We accept the love we think we deserve"  I cannot wait to delve into the book to find other gems  I already know I'll find the movie lovely  I thank Changing Hands for hosting yet another terrific book event- I had a wonderful time.
I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ  Go to Joe's BBQ in GilbertWe were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert  Now listen fellow yelpers you have never steered me wrong  So I was convinced this was going to be good after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at allWe arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket given the good reviews I had read on here  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into as there are no trays or plates)  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables like on a cruise ship  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok  Nothing to write home about  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream  It was not tasty at all  The beans were not bad  But the moist brisketit was moist alright - it was oozing fat  I think 50% of the meat was fat  I was somewhat disgusted  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either  Luckily he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side Cannot go wrong there  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips  I don't know what the big deal is about this place but I won't be back "ya'all".
Bloody awful  Usually a decent experience but today my friend ordered an omelette but asked for it scrambled  It came out an omelette  We reminded outr waiter it was to be scrambled  No worries right  Simple miscommunication  He took it back into the kitchen marched right back out after they cut it up thinking we would not notice it was the same f*cking omelette  Frustrated and insulted we asked that it be taken off the bill and forgotten  She helped me finish my omelette  Waiter copped an attitude  Then while finishing up another waiter decided to refill out jelly serving tray WHILE we still sitting there  Couldn't wait 5 minutes pal   SheeshGood thing OHSO serves breakfast.
Quick and fast food here Not the best.
Well let me just start out by saying that I am from the east coast and have used the same dentist my entire life until today  I had in impacted wisdom tooth that needed to be removed ASAP  I found Dr Poulos on the internet and read some review from other websites so I thought I would give him a shot  Wow was I taken back when I stepped foot in his office  I was greeted the moment I walked in the door and almost every staff member said hello and asked me how my day was going  The staff was all smiles and it seemed as if they really enjoyed their work environment  When it came time to crunch the numbers and see how expensive pulling just 1 wisdom tooth was going to be I was absolutely thrilled when I found out the cost was well under $400 per tooth (which is what I was quoted at about 10 other offices in scottsdale)  I explained to Dr Poulos that I did not have insurance and that cost was certainly an issue since I was paying out of pocket  He was very warm and friendly and did not try to up-sell anything I did not immediately need or want  I would highly recommend Dr Poulos and his entire staff to anybody that needs dentistry work done  He and his staff are extremely friendly outgoing helpful and very cheap  Give him a shot I have no doubt that he will impress you as much as he's impressed me.
Last Saturday my friend and I said what else is there to do on a Saturday afternoon except eat drink and hang out  We definitely went to the right place to do this  The new NoRTH in Arcadia Sam Fox's latest creation met our every need  I started off with a Stray Dog to drink  I'm not sure what was in it but it looked pretty and tasted good so I guess that's all that matters  My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good   For an appetizer we ordered the bread & cheese  I had no idea what to expect because it said it came with tomato jam  What is tomato jam  I'm still not sure I know but I know I would go back to specifically order this  The garlic bread came with warm melted Italian cheese almost like fondue in a little skillet  The bread with the cheese and the tomato jam was the perfect biteMmmm   Next we ordered a pizza to split  Verdure was the name of it  It was topped with brussels sprouts butternut squash caramelized onions hazelnuts and ricotta salata  Need I say more  Delish  My friend and I even told the valet guy on our way out to make sure he tried the pizza with the butternut squash  Next we split a pasta which was a recommendation from our waiter  (Obviouslyhow could someone not recommend this)  This was definitely my favorite  The Agnolotti (definitely homemade)  was filled with ricotta mascarpone pecorino grana padano and topped with herb butter  The sauce was so light that it allowed you to eat every single bite and we both did without being too rich  I don't usually eat pasta but I will definitely be eating this again soon  It really was so delectable  Next we split the Scottish salmon salad  How come I would never think to put marcona almonds and figs in my salmon salad with white balsamic  It was so tasty and flavorful  The food being served at tables near us definitely kept catching my eye  Everything looked so unique and appetizing  Besides the food the atmosphere was also very fun and chill  We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food  Oh wait I forgot my second drink  I got the Red Rooster which was like a fancy version of a Bloody Mary  It came with a little skewer of a caprese on it - really it came with little tomatoes and mozzarella on top of it  So awesome  We also ordered affogato for dessert but I was too full to eat it  My friend said it was orgasmic  Guess that explains that  All of the waiters were very attentive  Service is not always good at a new restaurant although here it was exceptional  It was fun to check out (no pun intended) all their different plaid and checked shirts too  Boring uniforms at a Fox Restaurantnever  I even told my friend and one of our waiters that this is the best Fox Restaurant yet  I don't live as close to this restaurant as a lot of other Fox Restaurants but I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more yummy food.
CLOSED TONIGHT 8-9-08  :(stupid bad economy.
The cheese steak with sauce & onions is almost as good as the chicken salad which rocks.
I love Haji-Baba more than words can say The food is cheap and delicous Their iced tea is AMAZING (the best I've ever had and I only drink iced tea and water 99% of the time) The hummus is to die for The pitas they make in house are fresh and delicious I have yet to find a place as yummy as this anywhere else in the Phoenix area (or even in Seattle where I live now) and the low prices make it that much more awesome.
Well couldn't help it gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu this time we tried a quesadilla an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drinkmmm The quesadilla was very different made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it damn good Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas The two burros we tried were equally tasty and just like last time the chips were spot on What's not to love about this place It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa it really is as good as everyone says it is heaven in a sauce basically Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back because I'm hooked From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner instead of a Taco Bell eh baby steps I guess 5/5.
This isn't a 'just went to this place once' review - it's a 'been going to this place for years' review Just thought I'd clarify that before getting into it Rula Bula rocks It was actually my first culinary experience when I moved to the valley 7 years ago I was skeptical as Irish pubs don't typically have a great deal to offer vegetarians (which I was at the time now I eat fish which opens up the menu a bit) but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options including veggie potato skins vegetarian shepherd's pie (that's right - never seen that anywhere else and oh so delicious) and the four-cheese grilled sandwich I prefer to go for lunch or dinner as the place gets a little college kid crowded rowdy the later it gets Yeah I know - I'm old.
Love this place Great breakfast and lunch specials Bagels are always fresh and love that it is a family owned business as well :) The owner is so sweet one time I had come in for a dozen bagels and left my debit card at home but he let me take the bagels anyway with the promise to come back and pay  I of course ran home with bagels in tow and came right back and paid he was almost disappointed I came back so quickly but there is NO place I know that would have been so kind.
Remember the Presidents of the United States Millions of peaches peaches for me millions of peaches peaches for free Well not exactly free but you get the point  Schnepf Farms annual peach festival is drawing to a close because the crop has been picked but I have one thing to tell you mark your calender for next year Around the second weekend in May Annual Peach Festival in Queen Creek They have hay rides peach pancake breakfast a peach bakery with all kinds of peachy goodness and peach jams jellies and salsas I actually purchased the raspberry and apricot jams in addition to 2 very large flats of peaches We were so excited when we got home We had tons of peachesThe whole experience was worth the heat sweat and dust of dirt not to mention the drive Take a drive through main Queen Creek and your whole experience will be fun and worth it.
I always think of the word habit as a nice way to describe a drug problem For example Whitney Houston's coke habit (too soon) or Heidi Montag's plastic surgery habit I would say that I might have a Habit problem since I eat here about 4 times a week Think of Habit as the love child from an orgy between In-n-Out Five Guys and Smashburger but cheaper and more delicious It is from California like INO it has many topping choices like Five Guys and it has other non burger options like Smashburger (although no alcohol unfortunately)I've had almost everything on the menu and I highly recommend the Swiss Mushroom Char and the Albacore Tuna Sandwich The Sweet Potato Fries are very good I would actually say that they are better than anything I've had at more expensive burger joints (*cough* that means step up your game delux and FEZ *cough*)The malts and milkshakes are pretty good also I haven't tried requesting anything crazy like a Neapolitan shake but I don't doubt that they would make that for me All in all this is a great regular spot because it is cheap and consistently delicious And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants.
Can't get enough Everything is delicious and doesn't feel heavy I could eat here everyday.
Awesome Awesome Awesome order a Pasty any Pasty if you want it customized call them ahead of time get it to go grab a drink get an irish car bomb for 3 bucks all day everyday have a unique experiance with a unique dessert and atmosphere much love totally Hipster.
Weather & Coffee is now closed They locked the doors last week without any warning I've heard a few things but don't know what's what so I won't say anything But here's the official line from their website:"Weather & Coffee has served the best coffee tea smoothies & pastries for almost three years We are proud of our products and services and have enjoyed serving our customers Sadly we have had to close down our Bell Road location The rigors of being open 7 days a week is one of the many factors in our decision But now we will have more time to devote to our family and elderly parents"It's a shame to see another small business owner go out of business Support Local Buy Local.
Yes I like this airport It is NOT bad at all I would give it less than 5 stars for a bit longer lines but they seriously go by sooo fast I like how it's huge I don't like small airports Bigger means they know what they're doing They also have good looking guys here Major +++ for eye candy I'll definitely be flying here again Well I kind of have to since my brother and sister-in-law live in Arizona They have plenty of stores and places to eat.
Think of the name of the restaurant as an oxymoron and you're on the right trackDisgusting food cheap ingredients unfriendly staff and pathetic dining area  I lived on this food when I was broke 2 years ago and I regret it I'd have rather gone into debt.
Oh Z how do I love thee  Let me count the ways1 LOVE your margaritas  Seriously  I'm not a fan of tequila and/or margaritas generally speaking but I love Z's margaritas  Especially the Chambord and Prickly Pear   Be warned though - they're VERY dangerous2 SALSA  I love it  They also have an appetizer with a variety of 3 salsas but honestly their original is the best  The chips are good too - light and crispy3 EVERYTHING on the menu  Not kidding  I haven't had anything I didn't like at Z  My faves include: catfish tacos Jerk Chicken salad Diablo Pasta Wild Mushroom enchiladas Mac & Cheese w/o bacon the trout seriously the list could go on and onMy mouth is watering  I think you get the point  Go to Z  ASAP.
Authentic Hawaiian plate lunch down to the macaroni salad All meats were delicious Will definitely add this to my regular stops when in the area.
I was desperate for food during my layover a the Phoenix airport and fell upon Barrio Cafe  Not many vegan or vegetarian options  I ended up ordering some kind of veggie sandwich which was okay  It came with this delicious yellow sauce that made the sandwich edible I was told that it was tomatillo sauce- yea I'm pretty sure that was inaccurate  What was disappointing about this place was how unwilling they were to accommodate your dietary needs  No substituions or changes you order what's on the menu That's it  And no salsa or chips to start-- I was told they didn't even have traditional salsa in stock Rather rude staff tooAnd of course prices are quite inflated to properly exploit your hunger during your airport visitI encourage you to bring some snacks before going to this airport.
We stumbled into this place after finding the doors at The Grind lockedwhat a fantastic surprise Organic and local ingredients a great craft beer selection and an owner/chef who was a delight to chat with We just moved to the neighborhood and having a place like this with some healthy options is a huge plus for us.
Very spacious and clean They have two train that ride around the park I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter They also have a carousel two playgrounds and two snack shops I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix.
The happy hour tapas are the hidden gem heresauteed scallops sauteed mushrooms etc a great value and great food.
Service is always great and food is consistent Huge fan of the fez burger or shrimp kisra The garlic aioli is out of this world.
Slow as fudgesicles.
Impressed with this strip mall alley dive bar I love the Hoot Owl Best part they have extremely clean restrooms for men and woman Great service and great deals.
When a friend and I were talking one thing we both agreed on @ LGO WINGS Bleu cheese and ranch are both AMAZING Pizza is incredible as well Made a great date night the other day Keep your shorts on for parking tho.
Our family and friends have used Action Auto Title for all our vehicle registration needs for over 10 years (used to be at a different location)  Shannon the owner is always professional and handles transactions so quickly  The small extra charge vs standing in line at the DMV is such a great value and Action is more knowledgable and helpful than any DMV clerk I have ever encountered  My friends and family always give me a call to thank me for sending them to Action Auto Title.
They make nice stuff but it's not amazing They have a lot of hidden costs such as $7 because you didn't buy the shirt there They claim are a set up fee but things are all done on the computer$7 to type When it's all said and done you have paid for $2 of work and $14 of fees I'll gladly take my business elsewhere.
This is great New Mexico-style Mexican food  The "Land of Enchantment" is a stand out dish--steak with 2 shrimp and a chicken enchilada: Very good  There were lots of things I wanted to try on a future visit  Great salsa and that dark red Santa Fe-like sauce whatever its called This place has good service great food and good atmosphere Definitely have some of the more NM-styled dishes rather than the basic Mex fare.
Great experience  Will come back again.
Amazing on all levelsperfectly spicedjust perfect We will be back often.
Booked an appointment at Northlight Counseling a month ago had my husband take the kids to preschool arranged to be late to work and navigated crazy Phoenix traffic for 60 minutes during rush hour only to have them tell me they made a mistake and didn't have me on their schedule Now they can't get me in for another month Ugh I don't think I will be going back They did apologize but I will not risk having this happen again  It's too bad because I had heard good things about Dr Hicks.
Everything about TFK is awesome from the vibe to the drinks to the food This is one of the most unique concepts you will ever find The food is very healthy but so incredibly tasty I recommend the Turkey Burger.
This place is AMAZINGLesson learned: arrive early  Call ahead and place an order  Get on the mailing listThere is nothing better than getting your meat from and English butcher  I recently read that you should develop a good relationship with your butcher  They know the meat inside and out and can give you the best tips when in comes to preparing or ordering  This is that kind of place  And it's only about 7 minutes from my houseWe left with grass fed ground beef grass fed patties rashers bacon (pork belly bacon yum) 3 tbone steaks and a hunk of beef for roast beefWe didn't find exactly what we were looking for because they were out and it was mid afternoon on a Saturday  Their advice was the above "lesson learned"This is the only place we'll be getting our meat from now on  What's better than your very own grass fed butcher  I can't think of much :).
I had the exact opposite experience I spoke to Gilberto on the phone and everything seemed pleasant enough we set up a meeting for the following day so he could come and inspect the place and give me a price We'd been out of town for the summer visiting our parents as we do every summer as we are both teachers and don't work summers You can imagine our place was pretty messy but he overcharged me by about $100 dollars it usually cost but I let it slide as I read the last positive review here and wanted a cleanup job fast We agreed but he never showed up with the crew and when I called Gilberto back to find out what happened he hung up in my face These people are unprofessional throw out "God bless you's" to get you to think they're decent but you don't make commitments and then don't show and hang up on people Luckily Four Seasons landscaping was incredibly positive professional did a wonderful job and cost about 125 dollars less- and were incredibly polite (you can find them on Angie's List).
I flipping love sub factory I used to eat these subs every day and tonight I found their frequent punch card in my wallet I've had it since high school I totally plan on eating these subs again I forgot all about it My order: Turkey on white with onions and banana peppers and provolone sometimes lettuce The turkey is shaved very thin and it's piled on the bread is so chewy and perfect The onions are sliced very very thin as well and it makes them so easy to eat Seriously I LOVE sub factory Definitely get an otis cookie while you're there too I always see cops and business men whenever I go in the space is small but clean with quite a bit of sitting space.
Phenomenal Latin American fusion almejas al vapor are a must and the table side guacamole is some of the best I've had.
I give this place 5 stars all the way We were out in Arizona this past summer and my boyfriend told me about this place and we got food there and I was blown away It was incredible I love their bread and the chicken I kinda wish they have this place in San Diego.
Costco now sells really good Honey Baked Hams  and if you have never had a REAL HONEY BAKED HAM as in FROM HONEYBAKED HAM Co on Cactus Rd then you can't die just yet  You must at least once in your life have one from here  I only buy them around holidays like Christmas and I have to wait in a big ass long line just to pick the ham up  You must  pre-order your ham in advance to guarantee you get one for Christmas  So as I stand in the line I tell myself that it would be so much better if I just decided to buy a ham in September sometime or in July-- but I forgetNot that waiting in the line is so bad they have lots of free samples of food and there are usually nice people around you to make conversation with- ever so often an angry husband who must not have  know what he was getting himself into when he said "sure- I'll run and pick up the ham honey"So this ham it is this perfect crunchy outer sugary glaze that just makes my mouth water thinking about it  You need to go to Honeybaked Ham Like FOR REAL.
WarningI am not a burger person  I do not love burgers and I do not look for new burger joints to open up  I still haven't been to Five Guys  So when I say this is the best burger I've ever had please take it with a grain of salt  BUTthe Delux is the BEST burger I have ever had  Honestly it had me at gruyère cheese  Everything is perfect on this burger  It's non-traditional and I love it  And can I please get an AMEN on the sweet potato fries  I have tried soo many sweet potato fries at other restaurants hoping they will be as good as these and I have yet to find any  I have no idea what they do with these fries maybe they fry them in sugar oil I have no idea what makes them great but you MUST get an order of themYes they are busy and the place is small and loud  I've always gotten excellent service They have a great beer selectionthey even have my favorite Hoegaarden  And for that reason alone I would give them 5 stars.
Been going here for years off and onSandwiches for lunch and pizza kits on the weekendsEverything in the deli is top qualityTheir homemade bread is incredibleThey even have a mini Italian grocery shelf It is where I can consistently get my San Marzano tomatoesLove this place.
Best handmade ice cream ever  Also fantastic local business with friendly family atmosphere  I love Scooptacular.
I am a member of all Village Clubs and when I can't make it to Gainey I'll occasionally drop in here since I have the multi-club membership This club is immaculate Love that they have two restaurants equipment is gorgeous/new and it's relatively Centrally located in Phoenix IMHO I think there are a couple of minor issues to this club but I think it's probably due to my lack of experience here and I need to adjust to this particular locations specifics The cardio area can become very busy and you might have to wait for a machine because this location doesn't have as many machines as Gainey The men's locker is gorgeous but I feel like I need a map or GPS because it is so sprawling and I often have gotten lost Bonus for the full bar you can consume all the calories you burnt off at the full bar Besides my slight criticism this gym is awesome Group activities often that are free yoga etc Love The Village.
This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix and I love the location I always the waffle with the amazing bacon There coffee is surprisingly good as well Whenever my wife and I try to "find" a new spot for breakfast in Phoenix we always just end up at Matt's It is that goodAlso I work at a restaurant down the road and we get a lot of travelers Anytime I recommend them going to Matt's they always come back saying it was a great experience I am glad that there is a place that I have enough confidence that no one will leave disappointed.
Recently had a wonderful dinner here We started off with an order of bruschetta which was incredibly fresh Then we each had a personal pizza the Regina Margherita and the Pomo All of the ingredients were perfection and the dough was nice and thin While we were waiting on our tiramasu (which was incredible) the head chef Matteo brought us a cinnamon liqueur that tasted like Cinnabon in a shot The service was great the patio was pleasant and the food could not have been better.
Modern Steak has a new Happy Hour menu but some of the old great HH items are still on the new menu Have no fear    all is still Happy at Modern Steak PS Had a great server named "Rachel" on our last visit On the patio A table of 10 who all ordered multiple items and multiple drinks and wanted separate checks and Rachel did not miss a beat or mix anything up      and most importantly she did it with a sweet smile  Great server  I hope we tipped her well.
WowWe have enjoyed this place when it was mobile mainly at the Scottsdale Farmer's Mkt But it appears that when the wheels fell off the truck rather than calling triple AAA they simply set up shop with some bricks and a lil' mortarThe nutella-banana crepe was as good as I remember but the star was the breakfast burritoThis burrito is now the benchmark as to which all breakfast burritos will be comparedThe crepe takes the place of the ol' flour tortilla and boy what an upgrade The crepe was super delicious on its own but then when you add fluffy eggums and mexican cheese and whatnot man I wanted to order a second one Also the latte's were delightfulWe are sure to be back :).
Our favorite Thai in the Valley The spicy basil cashew nut spicy noodle and the soups are all divine Spicy scale 1-5 we would usually go with a 4 or 5but at Siam we go 2-3 we've gone 5 before and could barely finish and even 4 really pushes it Regardless this place is legit.
Best managed Subway anywhere The staff are very friendly and very fast Try a veggie patty sub with avocado next time you are in the area.
What can I say we were lucky enough to get invited for pre-opening to this week at Tommy Urban Kitchen right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale The place was inviting very nicely decorated The staff warm and knowledgeable and Zoran who immediately greeted up with open arms always making you feel welcome We started with the Burrata which was Amazing Then into the Lobster Bisque with just a hit of saffron Perfection Then followed by the Best Clams and Lin quine perfect amount of garlic with gorgeous mini la clams best I have had in the Valley Which bring me to my husband Fettuccine Bolognase so flavorful and the meat giving the dish great substance and texture This Saturday Big Opening I recommend everyone try this incredible restaurant Which by the way will be offering Happy Hour pricing Monday-Friday from 11am-6:30pm with dishes from both appetizers to entrees and wines are fabulous Believe when I say once you try Tommy Urban Kitchen you will make this place your favorite local hangout Kudos to the Management and Chef they hit this right on the markLiz DTim D.
My husband works close to the area and we are scouting out a move to the area so I've really been happy to see what they are doing here It's reminiscent of outdoor shopping centers like Desert Ridge It seems like about 1/2 the shops seems to be open and that new things are opening each week The nice thing is that the stores here don't seem expansive and huge just because they have the space As such it's decently close to us (although there are other places to shop that are closer) but it has a nice mix of shops and such that I think I'll be making the drive a bit more often.
Horrible pizza place Pizza is gross and the service is equally as bad I called for a large pizza and was told it was $499 I asked for half pepperoni and half bacon When I went to pick up my order they charged me an extra $250 for splitting the toppings Would have been nice if they told me that when I called to place the order especially when I specifically asked for the price I asked to change my order since I wasn't warned about the extra price and I was told NO Never going back.
Wow  This place was delicious the ambiance felt authentic and our waiter seemed to emanate "The Heart of India" that of which I have often heardMy wife and I were in search of food on a late Monday night and we found Indian Paradise on Yelp  We ordered the Chicken Madras Palak Paneer and Garlic Naan and I liked it so much I found myself eating too quickly and wishing I could fit more in my stomachThe naan was among the best I've had and the ingredients in the Chicken Madras were savory and delicious  My wife who spent months in India said she was immediately harkened backOverall I love Indian food and I loved Indian Paradise  I humbly offer my 5 stars in thanks for their sumptuous meal.
For all you seasoned yelpers out there I opened an account just to give this specific BR store a reviewthough I'm sure I'll be back to provide more reviews as my Dad taught me to give credit where credit is due I recently moved to the area and needed some assistance with a handbag I purchased at BR well over 5 years ago  This bag went with me everywhere and worked with almost anything  Recently the sealant on the side of the shoulder strap began to tear and crack  I visited another BR while living in a different state and the only help I received was "get it fixed at a leather repair shop"  No attempt whatsoever to make it right  After visiting numerous leather repair shops they sent me back to BR as there was nothing they could do  Again I love this bag and quickly drove myself to my nearest BR ready for a throw down  The initial salesperson was helpful but not very encouraging  She gave me the usual "this looks like normal wear and tear" but asked to take my beloved bag and show it to her manager-Brody  Days passed and I was I sure that there was nothing they would do however the salesperson called me back to assure me that the manager would look into it but I needed to wait as he was out of town  Well Monday arrived and I received a call from Brody  He was personable and had already gone the extra mile by calling customer service  He told me that he would be unable to replace the bag (I figured that) but was willing to send me a VERY generous gift card to use towards the purchase of another bagWIN  And this was no wimpy gift card but enough to purchase almost any bag in their store  In fact I've already spotted a ringer for my bag that should be in the store soon  No arguments no hassle no brush off  I've read reviews regarding BR's return policy so I was doubtful I would get any help at this point but BR has changed how I look at their productThanks Brody.
Oh tacos Jalisco you are my everything Coming from a border town flooded with authentic Mexican food I set my standards pretty high for tacos and the likes Tacos Jalisco reassures me that I don't need to go back home for my fix These tacos are legit I recommend the al pastor cabeza and lingua So good I got my vegetarian girl friend to try one just because the smell of the to go box in my car was driving her crazyOh and the lady who took my order was a sweetheart as well.
I have never loved tacos This place changed my mind The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on I know that I will keep coming back.
One of the best restaurants I have been to in awhile  Each course was better than the last  Started with Melon gazpacho charcuterie ceaser salad and pasta with sausage The food was truly outstanding  The service was great  We sat outdoors on a beautiful December day  So refreshing to get such good food at a hotelI almost forgotthe bread budding  To die for  With dulce di leche on the side.
I have been utilizing MTO Cleaning for a few years now and am ALWAYS satisfied with the service  Judy the owner is fantastic and is always willing to work me in if I need a cleaning last minute  I also really like that she prices homes by sq ft - they don't have to come out to do an estimate like many other services do  They will come as often as you like and you will be VERY happy you spent the money - and I think it's EXTREMELY affordable.
You can't go wrong at this place the burger was great (best burger in town) the fries were delicious the onion rings were ok they even had PBR for $3  Plus there's always a good group of customers and staff inside and the music selection is great.
Wonderful stadium Situated in a beautiful area of Arizona The surrounding land is gorgeous SRF offers more than just games they have entertaining events & fun baseball camps for kids Very friendly & efficient staff.
Decided to try Safeway's home delivery Glad we used the "free" delivery code for the first delivery (and last delivery)  We didn't set our expectations very high we knew there would be some product change out due to the lack of bar code/item number ordering no biggie  Over half our order wasn't even packed to be delivered  The delivery driver was really nice and very professionalWe called customer service right after the driver left and were greeted very ho-hum you called for what  The gentleman on the other end of the phone wasn't very concerned with taking care of the customer  His fix was to credit an item that was rotten and the remainder of our order would be delivered before end of day NOTWe got a phone call at the end of the day that the delivery would not be coming back out to our house today so we would have to reschedule the delivery  Good thing we were trying their service and didn't have an immediate need for the items they neglected to send the first timeOver all we are really disappointed in the quality check for the fresh items accuracy check for the items ordered and the lack of customer service provided by the initial gentleman on the phone  Safeway delivery made no real effort to take care of us the customer.
I just love everything about this place The location the outside seating the vibe the food  everythingThe kitchen is very small This vintage diner car was meant for one cook So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other The food is top quality as well My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit The chicken was probably my favorite but it was impossible to eat like a lady It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth you have to get some on your face I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights picnic style seating and friendly staff I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night but he was so friendly and knowledgeable We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car This would be a great date place  if that's something you're looking for This is also a good place for a group of around 6 friends to take over a picnic table.
I purchased To Go a Moo Goo Gai Pan and a Sesame Chicken yesterday So much is wrong with PF Chang's First the amount of food was not worth $3000 Second the Sesame Chicken is noted on your menu as "spicy" Not even closeit actually had NO flavor Last the Moo Goo Gai Pan sauce was actually water Absolutely no flavor no sauce was added It was tasteless and awful Panda Express way better and much much cheaper You've been warned.
Terrible Debit card machine on pump never works And seriously it's 2013 quit charging for debit card use you stupid dinosaurs.
Horrible place The food was so-so it was the management They harassed and discriminated against me because I have a sight service animal What they did was illegal by state and federal law They should be ashamed.
The people at Glenfair Veterinary Hospital are fantastic The price for any service here is easily one-third of anywhere else and the service you receive is genuine They truly care about your pets and you can feel it the minute you walk in the door I live in East Phoenix but I'll drive the 30 minutes to give Glenfair my business.
I'm giving this place 5 stars on the quality of the sushi  I came here for lunch when on business and saw all the good ratings here so decided to give it a try  First off is don't come on Monday for lunch they are closed  Second be prepared to wait a bit for your order and items to come  I'm ok with that to a point  because I think they really spend the time to prepare everything so it comes out nice  But the woman working there seems not  to know many answers to the questions I had She really could not answer which fish are in which selection  She kept leaving and coming back to give me answers but between that and handling all the other tables it got to be a long wait to get everything  So on to my sushi order When I first got my order I was a little surprised of the selection I got it was mostly different types of tuna  I had red tuna white tuna albacore (a tuna) yellowtail spicy tuna rolls and 1 salmon sushi and a california fake crab like sushi and a shrimp sushi (Ebi)  All the fish tasted really good though the white tuna melted in my mouth The spicy tuna is made a little different than at most places  They chop it in pieces and and kind of float it over rice rolls Very good but would have liked a little more spice The sushi chef was very nice but seemed a little serious at the same time  He would keep asking if everything was ok and I just kept saying everything was fine as I tried to sneak in a picture of my dish I don't know why but somehow It felt like I was committing an illegal act  Anyway 5 stars for the great food and 4 stars for the the little things that I think that could improve.
I like good Pho and I cannot lie  You brothers and sistas can't deny  When the broth is steamin and the sides are fresh you get sprung  You wanna pull up a chair cuz you know it's stuffed with noodles deep in that bowl their servin'  I'm hooked cause I can't stop eating  Oh baby I wanna take some home along with some spring rolls  My homeboy tried to warn me but that Pho's got mememe so hungry - Enjoy.
Very noisy and the waiter rushed us to put in order  Tempura greasy Smelled like old oil  My cod was a small serving for $28 with no sides it was adequate that's it  They forgot one of our party's order and acted like it took longer to cook even though it was the same as mine  They took that off the bill but that was itRidiculous really for the money.
I must admit - Paradise is a gem I purposefully forget how good this place is because I sometimes disdain $10+ lunches but when I go I always think it's worth it Turkey & Cranberry sandwich is one of my absolute favorites of all time SW Caesar Salad (add the corn salsa) is also very high on my favorite salad list This location is always clean and friendly Convenient access to the highway (and my office) means I should go more often as should you Wish they included a drink with some sort of lunch special under $10 In my dreams.
Absolutely DE-LISH   I was throwing a bridal shower for my vegan cousin-in-law and luckily found this wonderful bakery  I sampled the cupcakes a few weeks before the event and fell in love with these great cupcakes  My fave - and the HIT of the shower - were the Boston Cream cupcakes  I will definitely be back  The owners are wonderfully kind and deserve support of the community  I have told and will continue to tell everyone I know about this place.
From the wine to the service to food this place is OG Italian If you are ready for some carb-loading this is the place.
Rude staff 20 minute wait for a drink while the staff talks and jokes doing nothing The bathroom was dirty with no TP The concert area had cat droppings and dead mouse parts all over and smelled like cat piss You had to walk around to the front to find a server Bad managementThe bluegrass band was GREATToo bad the service sucksI'm never going back when there are friendlier venues down the street.
As alwaysFlemings was perfect  Go here in Scottsdale and La Jolla---always perfect  Best steak everand I know a chainbut seriously amaze :)  If there's a Flemings around--I never seek out another steak place because we have a great time always  Even saw TW and Wil Ferrel one night at La Jollahahaha ).
Fantastic We had a very big table for a family dinner on Saturday Samanda was our waitress and she KICKED ASS We devoured everything including cheesecake for dessert The Burger here is 100% my favorite thing on the menu The steaks were fantastic but the bone marrow was a bit scary My veggie chopped salad was massive and very good but the dressing might be an acquired taste The tuna tartar and crab cakes were tasty appys However nothing and I mean NOTHING can come close to the popovers I wish I could just get a glass of wine and a popover for dinner Seriously thats all i need in the end Dont be a no carb bitch and turn these down They are worth every single ounce of delish *** I googled them less than 300 calories for the whole thing***  Again worth every single one The outside atmosphere is just perfect here BIg fireplace and lots of nice people to enjoy the sunset with Cant go wrong.
Best bar in Scottsdale Old west style.
The best way I can describe the Steele Indian School Park is:"This land once was used as a place where Native Culture came to die and is now being used as a place where Native Culture comes to be revived"I have been to sooo many events at this park The Native American Recognition Day Parade ends here and you can usually see members of different dance groups still dressed in traditional attire laughing and dancing or just catching up With a powwow to follow There are several gourd dances held there Gourd dancing is a very important ceremony where veterans of the military are recognized and thanked for their contribution by their people and are honored justly It's an amazing experience to go Recently the Arizona Indian Festival was held at the park There were traditional villages as well as various dance groups and arts and crafts vendors and of course frybread The festival was a way to take in the different cultures of the many 22 tribes in Arizona On "normal" days it's a nice place to just be The land itself has been blessed MANY times and I remember once a medicine man had asked the Creator to have the park serve the people and asked the the land be able to take anything He has in store for it Several years later the two helicopters crashed and landed about 5 yards from where that man once stood Since I know of many groups who came out to rebless the land and I as a Native American see it as the park doing just what was asked It served the people That accident could have taken more lives then the ones taken But instead it landed in the park and the land took it And is even starting to heal It served the people that day As horrible a tragedy as it was it could have been truely devistating Nearly all Natives have a story of the old Indian School in their family And it's actions have caused many reprocussions some natives were taught to hate their culture and traditional languages And to this day refuse to share their knowledge with their families Some had good times and like to sit around and laugh about their experiences climbing the fence to go run around in Phoenix (my auntie has SEVERAL of those stories) In the 1800's and early 1900's it was a tragic place to exist But like I said earlier our culture didn't die We still sing We still dance we still speak our languages We still grow and learn and teach our young ones We as a people still live on.
Most authentic Indian food outside of India  I know because I've been   Don't let the idea of  exotic food scare you awaythere's something for everyone here even vegetarians and children  Try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat  Try the chicken or paneer Makhani if you don't like the heat  For medium-spicy dishes the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread  If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor try the Tandoor Fish wrap  The key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table  You don't have to drink alcohol but there's a full service bar at all 3 of the Tandoori Times locations and the beer selection is above-average  This is the original location and offers a great semi-upscale atmosphere and a nice patio complete with hookah  Bellydancers join the fun on Friday and Saturday nights  Decent value if you crave very good quality food an exotic atmosphere and an authentic Indian experience  Ok the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic but it's definitely exciting  One of my favorite weekend hangoutssolid 5 out of 5.
My dear friend treated me to a Retirement Celebration yesterday and our experience at Seasons 52 was extraordinary  We had the ultimate server- Ken- who was informative about menu choices intuitive about dietary restrictions (my pal is a Vegan) an absolute delight and catered to our every need  We toasted with a lovely bottle of Cava and paired it with a Tomato Flatbread that was crisp and light- perfect for a hot summer day  My friend ordered the delectable Vegetable platter and I selected the special- a Copper River Salmon with corn risotto and asparagus- both recommended by Ken  All I can say is mmmmmmdelish  We couldn't say no to dessert and indulged in the individual Chocolate Peanut Butter Parfait  No matter the "season"- whether a 115 degree summer day or a crisp fall day- I am sold on Seasons 52  Ask for Ken- he will make sure your dining experience is truly a treat.
i love this theater  usually quiet in the AM if you like to take advantage of their $5 before noon promotion  they validate parking and the staff is normally pretty nice  my bf and i will normally hit up an early movie then stick around and grab lunch at one of the restaurants near by.
John and associate were on time for our move were friendly and courteous moved everything quicker than expected We saved time and came in under budget No problems at all and nothing was broken Use this service I can't recommend them enough.
After reading the thread about holiday giving I realized I had not reviewed Kidstop  The only kid I know is my nephew and I don't see him that often so I'm always at a loss as to what to buy him  Since it seems he has everything imaginable his parents are useless resources  Hmmm  That's an interesting contradiction in terms isn't itKidstop saves the day every time  They offer a huge selection of both educational and creative toys for kids of all ages  Lots of the standards like games trains planes and dolls but they also have more educational things like science kits and erector sets  I just found some cool stilts and parachute men last time too  My husband was sorely disappointed with our last visit however  Although they still sell the parts they took down the Rokenbok display  Now he has to shop like an adultSo what did we buy this year  A radio-controlled airplane that can be used in the house  That one is for his parents to lament over  And a magician's set of card tricks  I'm pretty sure he's a little scheister in the making.
Maggie is always finding the best products to bring to her clients and is always going to seminars to continue learning  I've been extremely pleased with Maggie's facials and on-going skin care and products  My skin looks tighter smoother and fresher than before working with Maggie  Her prices seem fair and she goes above and beyond every time I see her.
I have suffered with migraines for 41 years and if you have had them you get what it is like to not live life during those times Mine usually come in clusters generally not lasting longer than about two weeks - and generally only about 4-5 times a year As long as I preempt them with medication at the first sign I am good The last six weeks I have been living in a newfound private hell Either my body is rebelling (all those wrinkles lol) or weather Whatever it is this is the longest cluster I have had I called this office BEYOND DESPERATE Mayo is booking into October - and I can't take anymore pain I am so impressed with the office staff and the doctor I have not even been in and was virtually in tears when they told me they were booking first appts in three weeks THREE WEEKS It MIGHT as well be next year with the pain I was in Bless her heart the receptionist asked e doctor if she would come in a little early next week one day to see meand she said YESThat is old fashioned medical care and service I haven't even been to the office yet and I am already giving five stars Impressive.
I love Qdoba I go here every weekend have a Member card etc Many people think of this as the same thing as Chipotle they are very similar except I here they have a bit more choices I believe I used to go to Chipotle a lot but once I found this place this is all I ever go to Best thing about this place is the Queso Burrito Best thing on the menu Also when I ask for a side of rice they give me a nice cup of rice on the side for like 80 cents unlike Chipotle when I asked for a side of rice they give me this little "shot glass" sized plastic cup of rice and expect me to pay 135 or something like that Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food I'm sure you can find some authentic mexican place if you want that but this place has its own menu and its own flavor Definately a place you should try out and see for yourselfI am a regular at the Rural Rd location and love the people there They are nice and friendly and since I always have a hard time deciding they give me some pushes in the right direction to get me to decide P The place is always clean and have never had a problem here.
Always have armen cut my hair Always good and professional guy Highly recommend.
(Revised 2/26/10)- - - - - - - - - - - - -Early 2009:I bought a huge bank-owned house for a song & didn't need 18 rooms for myself & my cat so I went to work doing a major remodel on the place to carve out some apartments to rent out  As the $1000s started to pour out I set up some books to try to prepare for 2009 tax time & soon realized I was in over my head with the accounting (if not with the whole project)  Of course I came here to Yelp to find helpI was impressed by the 5-Star review I read here by fellow Yelpie John S for Michael Gallacher CPA so I called over there  Gallacher's nice assistant Brenda set up a convenient appointment for me & I went inAlong with John S I found Michael Gallacher to be both immediately likable and completely knowledgeable  In about 45 minutes we got me on the right track to prepare for 2009 tax time  I brought a list of questions which were all cheerfully & clearly answered & the whole session went just right  My cost to straighten out the mess my books were in & get everything set up properly was a reasonable $125 & it brought me a lot of peace of mindI left Gallacher CPA completely satisfied & confident that I was now keeping my records properly for tax time  5-Stars==================================================9/22/09:I dropped in to Gallacher's office unannounced with a different IRS issue  Michael Gallacher was out but I was greeted warmly by the receptionist & then seen right away by Michael Bosen another partner in the firm  Just as with Gallacher I found Michael Bosen to be completely likeable & knowledgeable  On top of that he jumped right in to solve my problem even though I had shown up without an appointment  The fee for the new service I needed was reasonable & it's 5-Stars for Michael Bosen too==================================================January 2010:Once I had all my W-2s & so on I brought them in along with the books & receipts for 2009 that Michael Gallacher had me keeping & piled them on his desk  My complicated situation called for THREE Federal & TWO state tax returns to be filed with all kinds of extra forms & so on  I don't think I would have gotten it anywhere near right trying to do all this myself  We talked for a few minutes Michael cheerfully took on the task & everything was ready to go in just a week or so  They were able to able to electronically file most everything too & now just a couple of weeks later I have received my tax refunds  I can't overstate how happy I am using Michael Gallacher & this firm.
From the Get go i was depressed when i walked in to the theater first of all its dated and needs some serious upgrading Second when i ordered my pop corn and started to eat it i found it to be cold and stale Then while watching my movie a homeless person snuck into the theater and was annoying First they come in with all their stuff and just throw it al over then they fell asleep and started to snore up a storm When i Told the guest services person they radioed it in and the manager came to wake the person up but they stayed in the theater For the remainder of the movie (15 hrs left) they played with a plastic grocery bag the crinkling noise drove everyone in the theater insane when we told the manager they did nothing about the situation Overall i am deeply saddened that a theater brand I frequent and have come to know as my go to theater has let this theater slip through the cracks.
Good Pizza gets a little soggy if you don't eat it right up He needs to get those mesh metal plates that sit on top of the plate so the juices of the pizza don't make it soggy Nice outdoor experience Staff was very attentive We went on a Saturday after the Phoenix Farmers Market was done The owner came out and talked to us and asked us how the food was Very nice person Will go here again Great place for families.
The rating is because of the gluten-free crust Anyone who is gluten-free knows pizza is tough to come by This is my third shot at a gf crust and it's a ton better than the others Thin fairly crispy (not easily done gf) and good I got the napoli (tomatoes and basil) and they have a bunch of other specialty pies Very casual and they do slices A definite pizza stop downtown.
Fabuloso  This is my kind of place  I love everything from the great candle smell when you walk in to all of the knickknacks that you want but don't really need  There was really cool note cards that made me wish I sent more thank you cards so I could justify the purchase but who knows maybe I'll find a use for them yet  One of my favorite items was a book of shopping lists that had been found and bound into a clever entertaining read (with organized chapters)  The slang flashcards had me laughing along with many other great novelty items  There are also fun vases books and all sorts of random gifty items  I enjoyed my short time going through the mish-mash of inventory and I hope you do the same  I will definitely be back and leave with a purchase next time.
Absolutely beautiful propertyNow that they have been renovated I am going to frequent the property every year By far my favorite Hyatt to date Their rooms are large and their balcony is the biggest yet They offer a table you can enjoy breakfast at and two lounge chairs to tan on (If it isn't scorching hot)They have 20+ pools One of them is a beach pool that has sand entering the pool which I think is pretty awesome they have a great grotto and the COOLEST WATER SLIDE EVER You go like a million miles per hour and basically fly off of the slide so hold on to your swimsuit Ha And did I mention the pools are open 24/7 YES 24/7 How awesome is thatNow don't let me forget about their Front Desk and Pool staff All of them were smiling and very helpful Upon check-in we were offered Prickly Pear margaritas that were not stingy on the alcohol and full of flavor Loved themI can say so many great things about this property but of course you just have to experience it for yourself Enjoy.
My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed Both of our dishes were beyond delish We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved) I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try I love all of the seafood options Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well.

Top notch all around I don't have a single complaint about this place The service was extraordinary the pizza comes out quick and is some of the best pizza I've ever tasted in this town The owner even came by our table after we had finished eating and poured us complimentary shots of his homemade limoncello You can tell from the second you walk in that the owner and his employees take great pride in their restaurant.
I could not be happier with this preschool My first child is going to graduate to kindergarten this year and my second will be in the 3's class next year  The teachers are outstanding  After researching so many other preschools the thing about this preschool that makes it stand out is the community and the parent education  As a first time parent not only was I not ready to send my child off to school and not be part of it but there was so much I didn't know  Since this school is a co-op I was able to carry through with what my son learned at school and reinforce it at home  I learned so much from the expert teachers  In addition I have formed close bonds to the other co-oping parents  I can't think of a better way to model a sense of community to my children than to actually live it  The school offers a developmentally appropriate curriculum and allows children to learn through play  I could go on and on about this school and it's community.
Artie responded to my message within 5 mins and proceeded to walk me through the repair  After a few failed attempts I threw my hands up and asked Artie to come out to my house  Based upon my schedule Artie was able to schedule an appointment for 6:00 pm that night which I appreciated With most other plumbers I would have had to wait until the following day just to get a returned call  Artie was punctual polite and cleaned up after himself The price was right as well  I have already given his contact info to a coworker who is in need of a good plumber  I will definitely call Artie in the future.
Me and malls BLECCCHHbut I have to say I love this mall  I miss this mall  I could walk this entire HUUUUUUUUUGE mall and never get bored  Tired yes but never bored  They really built this place up over the years and it's gorgeous  Some very high end but also some reasonably priced stores too  I haven't even seen it in the past few years (having moved to CA) but I speak with friends who tell me the latest happenings  They frequent this mall all the time  It's okayI WILL go back someday  This mall has something for everyone  I can't say that about most mallsat least out here in SoCal.
The ambience is great Highly recommend the sopprassata sandwich and the Italian ices (especially the pear brandy).
The best Mexican food we've found in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area since we moved here a few years ago  Tried it initially based on a recommendation and now El Encanto is where we take all of our out-of-town guests for a great meal paired with great ambianceMy personal favorite is the pollo fundito  Great flavor great portion size  I also really like the salsas that come out with the chips before the meal  The first time I was there I wound up taking a container home  We're always sure to get deep-fried ice-cream as a desert too  The pond in the center of the property is beautiful (except for the one instance we saw where a bunch of large geese all ganged up and attacked a small helpless duckthe wait staff did their best to save it)  Also don't allow yourself to get seated in the back room of the restaurant  No view of the pond and a large loud clunky heater or a/c unit kills the ambiance  We'll be back many more times I'm sure.
Walked into Jimmy John's at 6pm on 10/31 to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter The dog was not a seeing eye dog or one in training Dog had its front feet up on the counter and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog Pretty disgusting for food being prepared 1 or 2 feet away No thanks.
The food here is very fresh and well balanced  I have been here twice (proximity to the office) and I am happy they are so close  I will conitnue to come back here with my wife for dinner to explore teh wine list  Service was very attentive and I even got to meet the owners they seem very excited to have such a great spot with such good food  For those in the area you will not believe that this used to be Darwins a dingy sports bar  If that is what you remember come out to see Nook and be impressed.
We were one of their first ten customers when they opened the downtown Glendale location I was so excited to see them in North Glendale  It's not fancy but you get great food at reasonable prices Their red tamales with sauce are to die for My favorite chorizo is still Carolina's  but they run a close second hereThe carne asada rocks.
This place is spectacular I have a dog grooming facility and our employees and I often place an order for pick-up It's the perfect little treat and pick-me-up and Robeks' staff is awesome with our call-in orders They are always ready correct and exactly what we need to finish out a day of puppy scrubbing :o)Thanks Robeks You rockps I would take Robeks over Jamba Juice any day.
I'll fully admit that I am a regular of this Pita Jungle location I come here an average of times a week Usually I meet friends for their awesome Happy Hour and come on the weekend for dinner with my Husband or FamilyThe servers area always really attentive and helpful They are great with substitutions and picky orders When at Happy Hour I don't really drink the alcoholic beverages but prefer their Decaf Berry Iced Tea which is delicious Happy Hour is CHEAP and served Tapas style (I believe it is from 3-5:30 and then Reverse from 9-close) For $6 I can get a full mealI usually get an array of the following:-Falafel with Tahni (This is always delicous just the right seasoning and texture)-Hummus Trio (I love their Hummus flavorful smooth and just the right consistency You get about two-three tablespoons per order)-Feta (They give you a block of feta cheese drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped cucumbers onion and tomato zataar as well It's delicious)-Baba Ghanoush (REALLY nice and creamy I don't love egglplant but I love the subtle smokiness of this dip)-Pita with Thyme and Olive Oil (This is basically a small pizza with olive oil thyme tomatoes feta and kalamata olives It's perfectlly cooked and always yummy)-Olives (They would probably be a little bit better if they were heated but they have a great variety)The dips are served with Pita and it is always the perfect consistency Just soft enough but still with a little chewAll of these items run $1 or $2 It's incredibleI'm a vegetarian but I know that my friends enjoy the Chicken and Shrimp options They also have a very fresh looking caprese tapaFor dinners I've tried a variety of Items I really like the Mediterranean Platter but it's just too much food for me I love their cold garlic and tomato green beans that come on this dish but you can also get them as a side dishI often get an order of Lentils and Rice Feta Cheese Small side of hummus and 2 falafel balls (which come with their rich and awesome Tahini) I mix them all together and made a Mediterranean Burrito Bowl It's awesome and I always appreciate that the wait staff is accommodatingAlso their Red Lentil soup is a notable starter It's really perfectly balanced and flavorfulMy husband is easier than me He enjoys the Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Shwarma He also likes the Mediterranean Chicken Salad We come with large groups and people always seem to enjoy their meals and order a variety of menu itemsThey have a great patio which we enjoy sitting on for nice days/nightsFor large groups- as far as I know they don't take reservation and sometimes there's a 30-40 minute wait for groups bigger than 4 on a Saturday night We never really mind waiting thoughI love Pita Jungle.
I'm a fan  Saw this place after eating at the restaurant next door  We took some samples but we were stuffed and promised ourselves to come backGlad we did  Everything tastes the way it says  Double Chocolate Brownie  It tastes like chocolate with brownie not overpowering and those little chunks are yummy  Strawberry Cheesecake  Tastes like cheesecake ice cream with swirls of graham cracker crust and chunks of strawberries again so yummy  Mango Orange Coconut Key Lime Pie  it goes on an onThe possiblities are endless and although it seems like a small cup it's the perfect portion size  The price is reasonable for the quality and the serviceWe keep coming back and experimenting with mixing the flavors  A must try.
This place has everything Not always the best prices But if you need it for a crazy/fun recipe you will find it at BevMoI had a themed party for the Moscow Mule last month and BevMo was the only location that had the Cock and Bull Ginger Beer The drink was deliciousI do think it is very funny how BevMo is usually just around the corner from the Total Wine in The Valley almost like fast food chains for adults.
I will keep this simple the food is good and the price is rightI eat here to often and have probably shortened my life expectancy (it isn't the healthiest choice in town).
I order from Silver Mine Subs Arizona on a weekly basis and besides having great food the staff is awesome they're always really quick with their deliveries and if there are ever any issues they make an honest effort to resolve the issue That is why I order from them almost every week Thanks guys.
I've been banking with Chase for over a year and a half now but out of all the branches I've walked into this one takes the cake It helps that I work right across the parking lot but it's also a newer branch so it's up to date and modern They host a networking function every few months inviting all the surrounding businesses to stop by and share what they do with each other They go all out too supplying all kinds of food and drink (also from the local businesses) The manager tellers and personal bankers here have been extremely helpful in getting my accounts in order I do my banking at this branch whenever possible.
My car AND my friend's car were both keyed in the parking lot here I haven't been back since.
Ugh I love Filbertos cheap tasty food but I hate the service I called earlier today to see if they could deliver A girl picked up said "hold on" and hung up Then I called back several times and nobody answered Pretty obvious they were dodging my calls.
Aaaaamazing~ such an awesome new hang out spot Here are a few highlights:The prices are great I really recommend the happy hour from 1 to 8pmServices was very helpful helping me pick a wine that I would like The guy even let me sample a small amount before I bought a glass- and of course I ended up buying a bottle The decor is beautiful You can write on the chalk wall The only thing I didnt like was the sign out front But there was no way I was going to dock points for that You NEED to try this place.
My Wife and I love this place great salsa bar tacos and burritos Not your average mexican beans and rice kind of place.
I'm not sure why everyone loves this place  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menuoh wait there's not oneand no I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast  ick  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me Matt.
We went here for dinnerhad dined here before however this time we were fortunate enough to have a Groupon I would dine there without it any day of the week We love the byobsince that allows us to have a reallllly good bottle of wine ($9 corking fee - nice) with an excellent meal Highly recommend itbest meal I've had outprobably since Binkley's and that's saying something.
This is one of my favorite restaurants We've been going to Eddie V's for several years and usually go about two to three times per month You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I always go back to my favorites which are: crab cakes Jonah crab claws wedge salad either Parmesan crusted lemon sole snapper meuniere or a halibut special when in season au gratin potatoes sugar snap peas crab fried rice sauteed spinach Godiva chocolate dessert bananas foster I don't like shrimp but my husband swears by the shrimp cocktail or any of the shrimp dishes They have a huge wine list and many specialty drinks Dining on the back patio is great Wonderful views.
Years ago I had a Jack Russel who was very 'alph'  Brad worked with us and my Jack Russel became a happy obedient dog  Brad was never harsh or mean and our dog responded beautifully  I had vets comment on what a well behave Jack Russel he was  I now have a wonder chihuahua who is sweet but stubborn  Brad and Jade are great my puppy is already responding  I love this group and the philosophy  It is more price they 'puppy mill' trainers but sooo very worth it.
We stayed at the Hyatt Place in Scottsdale in January 2009  For all of us it was our first time staying at a Hyatt Place (I'd actually never heard of the chain)  The amenities were nice the rooms were spacious and the free WiFi was great   The lack of room service was a bit of an annoyance but apparently serves as an indication of how the hotel views hospitality at large  Never in all my hotel stays (which range over 100 times a year) have I been so poorly treated by hotel staff  I cannot would not and will not ever recommend staying at this hotel - no matter how much you save over local competitors or how pretty the lobby decorations are.
Everything at Reathrey is full of fresh herbs flavor soothing amazing fragrances and probably some voodoo Maybe a little magicBest of its category in Arizona by far Oh and I don't think I've ever said this about anywhere ever but get the corn Absolutely get the corn.
I had never heard of this place but after following my friend to Charlie's one night this foodie friend of mine mentioned that a well-known local chef said this was one of his favorite places to go  With his stamp of approval I immediately jaywalked from the lightrail stop at 7th Ave over to this goofy looking van with a "CARNE ASADA" sign in the window  Don't worry - the food is not actually served out of this van of which I had accidentally given my mother the impression There was a small line but the small assembly line of taco-makers are very speedy so the whole experience only took about 15 minutes  We ordered the carne asada tacos which were $1 a piece with everything on them (salsa cabbage and sour cream)  I am always skeptical of hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints as I got deathly ill after (my one and only) trip to Filiberto's but I truly enjoyed these tacos (and my stomach did not reject them yay)  I think they are only open Thursday through Saturday but I am not positive  My boyfriend and I live down the street and went back the other night and had another great experience  There are a couple picnic benches for customers to eat at but as we were not in the mood for this type of atmosphere we took the tacos to-go and they were just as yummy to go.
My wife and I love this place  Great sushi and nice presentation  The patio outback is nice and romantic too.
Great bloody Mary menu Fun fun place.
What a difference a year has made here  Since Landry's has purchased Morton's the menu has grown into many options for you to choose from  The addition of the Mixed Grills The 4 layer Chocolate Cake ( which is homemade) Shredded Steak tacos and a fantastic happy hour how can you go wrong  Service is still top notch and the new music adds to a less stuffy environment  We celebrated a special occasion with some friends and we were greeted with a personalized menu and an unexpected raspberry souffle  Nice touch  We will definitely be back.
I had given up on ever finding great Chinese food in Arizona Chous is not only the greatest in the state but I would venture to say the best I've ever had anywhere  Seriously  Their beef pies are the best every time we go (which is pretty often now) we get beef pies and some kind of eggplant dish-- either the eggplant potato and jalapeno or eggplant in brown sauce Other favorites on the menu are beef friend rice any of the pies or dumplings and beef noodles You can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order even the fish is greatThis place has become our new favorite not just favorite Chinese but one of our all time favorite restaurants.
Great food.
Went for lunch  It's still within two months of opening and it's doing well from the size of the crowd  Parking is a bit of a challenge and you may have to park across the street (or in Amigo's Appliances lot as I didnot suggested)  The atmosphere is a nice change from most Pho places  It has a modern slightly contemporary feel to it with all the amenities of a social meeting locale (good bar few small TV's in the corners above the bar)  Walls are exposed brick and it has the now required community tableHad the Pho and it was outstanding  Tough to find good Pho generally in Phoenix but their's is impressive  Fun upbeat staffOnly hit was that it did take a little time to get the food but nothing too lengthyTry it out.
The pizza was absolutely delicious as expected and the mozzarella was dreamy However the treatment we received horrible   We had never been before  so my husband and I ordered a pizza to share  since we are not big eaters It was clearly not enough So get thiswe tried to order another pizza and were told "no there are too many people waiting" We were given are check and the table was cleared  I don't care how good your pizza is You can lump it for such rude behavior I would rather get a Dominoe's Death Disk before I would return.
This is my first time owning a pool and we decided to hire a pool company to do the routine service required since I am clueless I am THRILLED with Diamondback Pools level of service Tom called me on Tuesday and we scheduled an inspection and cleaning for Friday He was prompt and verypatient/ helpful in explaining what was going to be required to maintain the pool We have setup for Diamondback to pop out weekly to help us with the routine maintenance Thank you Tom.
I'm visiting from LA so this was the first time I have eaten at Best Of Philly I will for sure eat there next trip The Gyros was amazing And the mushroom steak sub was too die for Thanks to the nice people working I think it was the owner and maybe his wife.
I have very little faith in chain restaurantsPanda Express lunch was really badNoodles - overcooked choppy wasted flavorlessI chose a "Grilled Chicken" which was 70% chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue  Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leatherIts just not goodFact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately.
BEST burger I've had in a LONG time Great service but still laid back and the NFL ticket Can't say enough how amazing the food it though.
Love this place Toddy is fantasimoso atmosphere is way too cool for me staff is friendly and remember you For something different try a Dirty Iced Chai Tea which is also amazirocking +1 for free wifi parking can be difficult if you are cool ride your bikeUpdate: I've fallen in love with black coffee because of this place Thanks Cartel for my new obsession.
The new restaurant in downtown phoenix is fantastic  The only drawback is the wait time because my last visit included a forty minute wait   If you cannot decide which dog to pick try the one with the peanut butter and popcorn.
C&R Tire is an amazing shop with friendly professional peopleLast night I noticed a screw in my tire I managed to limp home on my donut but knew it would not be safe to drive down the highway to work this morningI found C&R online and noticed they opened at 7 At 6:45 I called and Tracy picked up helping me to find the shop From the get-go she was extremely friendly and I felt like I would be in good handsWhen I arrived they quickly got me up and running in about half an hour The friendly people at C&R even put my donut back in the car and secured all of my parts that I had out when I jacked the car up last night These are great people doing a great job I will be back every time I need work done with the car.
I absolutely dug this place  A very modern bar with an outside bar and seating area was perfect company to the awesome weather  The decor was pretty cool too  Can't wait to go back  The bar manager was also very welcoming and pleasant.
If I could marry soup I would do it I mean I love soup more than life itself and there are days when I have a soup that makes my husband come in a distant second (and I love HIM to pieces) This is how I feel when I order soup from Vermont Sandwich Company Today's choices Roast Beef Vegetable & Chicken Florentine were both fantastic Yep I orderd a cup of each instead of a soup and a sandwichseriously it's THAT FREAKING GOODThey make these soups fresh every day so you call in the morning to find out what today's pot of gold will be A few weeks ago I called the day before and not only did they not know yet what the soups would be the next day I GOT TO PICK THEM Holy mother of Pearl did that make me a happy girl The standard French Onion is incredible but the potato leek or corn chowder are also fantastic Heck I haven't ordered a soup yet that didn't put me over the moon In store one day got to sample the Country Apple as well(drool)And don't forget the cookies Yep Maple baconjust saying.
I've been here a handful of times already since they've opened I believe in June or July At first I was skeptical about the place they seemed a tad unorganized (but every starting business is) their lunch menu isn't too bad they have THREE sushi rolls for only $10 ( although there is a list for you to choose from) the sushi here isn't too bad but yet I haven't tried anything too fancy The only time I had lunch here it wasn't too busy I was taken care of pretty well by Vivi although I did need to ask her to fill up my glass a few timesThe next couple of times I've came were all weekends HECTIC I went there Friday night and they were slammed Good thing my party did make a reservation ahead of time ( highly recommended ) even though we did have to wait a few minutes to be seated it was definitely better than the hour wait that some people had There was a huge crowd in front of the door and it was pretty hard to spot the hostesses to check in but it eventually happened Tiffany which seemed to be the only hostess was very accommodating and helpful and sat us fairly quick As we were seated we were greeted within 2-3 minutes by our wonderful server Kathy I ordered the Ocrean Trio which included lobster tail scallops and shrimp for $36 and it also came with soup and salad fried rice veggies and two pcs of shrimp I say that's a great deal Our teppan chef David was very funny and entertaining and cooked everything to order Our server Kathy was excellent She was very good with refilling drinks there were times that I didn't even know she took my glass to refill it I never had a half empty glass Even though she was slammed with other tables across the room she always came and checked on us with a smile Restaurant itself is very well decorated bathrooms were tidy you can choose to sit in regular dining or teppan side Atmosphere is great eventhough it's a tad crowded on weekends but that's what makes it funThanks TonyI definitely will continue coming I hope this great place will last in Mesa.
Loved this place  It was great to get seated in back by the yard but still inside  ordered about 5 plates and loved everything  get the crab in the jar it is basically a cup a butter with crab in itwaiter was great and it was really cool to have three different places inside one location/.
We've been to many Indian food spots in the past but this is by far our favorite The food is always on point and we are always greeted with a smile.
I am addicted to looking fabulous all the time Carmen makes my lashes long thick and beautiful I am a fitness instructor/ dance teacher and don't always have the time to put on make up in the morning Carmen does an amazing job Her prices are fantastic and her work is beautiful HIGHLY recommend her.
Last chance the only bargain basement you will ever go to and see women with high end louis vuittons + chanel bags digging for cheap finds A couple reasons why I love last chance: $200 basic tee shirts and tanksGreat price jackets last time I was there I scored 3 north face jackets for $3000 each Shoe selection is great sometimes if you are extra lucky your shoe size might be going for an additional 50% this happened to me once and I walked out with 12 pairs of shoes High end Jeans/Slacks/Trousers are normally in the $2000 - $3000 range A couple reasons why I hate last chance Anxiety level goes up when women trample over me and plot to steal from my cartMen's section is sparse but non existent The line to the private changing room is painfully long (if you are uncomfortable changing in their open changing area) Many items are badly damaged (holes rips stains) so everything you buy must be examined very very carefully Bag selection there is pretty terrible prices are very high for Last Chance's standards and bags are often broken in bad shape or need repairs All in all if you are looking for a good/anxiety filled/thrifty day of shopping This place is IT.
LOVE this place It is my "go to" deli and grocery store when I need that special Italian item I cannot get anywhere else Italian wedding cookies cannolis pizzelles and coffees Great selection of salads and pasta items in the deli.
Grimaldi's has to be the most over-rated pizza in the valley  If you're going for the ambiance and service fine this place is more than adequate  If you're going specifically for pizza and could care less about ambiance this place is a big flop  They obviously think the star of a pizza is the crust  If you agree you will probably like this place  But if you think toppings are the main ingredient and crust secondary DON'T go here or you will be disappointed  The crust is decent crisp and tasty with coal smudges on it which is a good thing I guess but I ordered a simple basic large sausage pizza and the sauce was almost non-existent there was a fine sprinkling of cheese that you really had to look for to make sure that wasn't the bare crust staring up at you and the sausage was equally skimpy with maybe an average of 1 to 1 1/2 crumbles per large slice  If you are a yuppie or like to flock to trendy places this is for you  If you'd rather have a good thin crust pizza with decent toppings go somewhere like Spinato's.
I found out yesterday that all UPS stores are franchises and totally unconnected to UPS I would never ever use one again While in Kauai two weeks ago I bought a good quality ukulele ($hundreds) and sent it to a relative in the Midwest It was missing for nearly 3 weeks (finally found yesterday) Still not delivered and opened so don't know yet in what condition : (UPS blamed the UPS Store (in Kauai) the store blamed UPS The long and short you have even less protection than sending directly with UPS or even the POST office for heaven's sake because they both can blame the other This is backed up by legal disclaimers in back-of-the-form fine print I used this store once and they were WAY unfriendly but I find that's true of other UPS Stores And now I'm done with all of them.
One of the most beautiful places in the valley  A tour here is a must  They have great clubs (I am a member of the Monarch society) and great events.
Ordered the Carnitas burrito as well as the steak burrito I also ordrered the cheese quesadillas with chickenThe pork was WAY TOO SALTY  I couldn't finish it without drinking a tonFigured that it was a fluke from a heavy-handed cook with that one particular burrito so dug into the steak and found it to be just as as salty What a disappointmentThe quesadillas were not badHowever with how salty the two  burritos were I can not recommend Desert Springs.
The paletas are very delicious and they remind me of home in MexicoI tried the nuez (pecan) and the mango with chile Both were very goodI definitely think is worth checking them out specially when you see a line over 10 people waiting at the Tempe storeOne suggestion have more flavors available.
I have been here several times now so it's time I write a review I LOVE this place  Seriously  Ok I know soda is bad for me weather is full on cane sugar or diet stuff it's all bad  We all have are vices right  At least I limit myself to one per day  I try to keep the addiction in check  And I love variety  I could easily get stuck in a rut with Pepsi Coke and Dr Pepper but at Pop The Soda Shop that is impossibleThere are rows and rows of soda  If you can imagine it they probably have it  It's amazing  They even carry some types of water and energy drinks  My favorite is the Root Beer isle  They must have 50 types of root beer  I love trying different types of root beer and this is the place to go if you love the beer of root  They have Dr Pepper in little bottles  YUM  And Stewart's Key Lime soda which is the BOMB  If you have not tried it you must  I also happen to be a fan of Cheer Wine and they've got plenty of that too  Of course they have the "real" coke in glass bottles too  An ice cold coke in a bottle is the best  If you just can't wait to try something they have just about everything cold in the cases in the back  And if ya go on a hot day that is a mustThe staff are knowledgeable and very helpful  I have bought cases and they have happily put them in my care for me  I would rather give my hard earned dollars to a locally owend and operated store than a big box store when I have a choice  So go and stock up on your soda here  It's worth the trip wherever you are.
I could not ask for better This is the only car place that has not tried adding more to my bill Not just once but everytime I go there the gentleman is always looking out for me and not how much more they can get cause im a woman They don't try to sell me anything that is not neededI am a loyal customer.
This is my absolute favorite place for boba I have been going there for the last year regularly and have tried so many flavors I have a week spot for the Taro smoothy though I am sure I have tried every boba spot from Phoenix to the East Valley and theirs is perfect They manage to get the most perfect evenly textured boba with just the right amount of chewy yumminess I stop by there every time I am going to pass Dobson on the freeway  Its so hard to resistThe diamond ice is great too I love mine with mango I have yet to try their ramen though as I am afraid of holding it to the standard of another shop in Tempe but I'm willing to give it a try.
I haven't climbed at every gym the area because I'm about a mile away from PRG and I love this place The staff is really friendly and the setters aren't sand-baggers meaning the problems are rated quite difficult If you can climb at PRG you will find it easy to climb most everywhere else including outdoors My only gripe is that their setters aren't very consistent The problems can get very challenging requiring you to think about how to send each route however one 510 might be much easier than another 510 and it's even worse for bouldering where some V2s are like other V1s and some V1s are like other V3s.
Best Quiznos ever Chris and Christine are the 2 nicest managers of any restaurant I have ever been too They are there every Thursday and know what we like and greet us with a smile Quiznos has great food for the price but I go to this place for the service outstanding Thanks Chris and Christine.
It's huge you can get lost and not come out without buying something also the food in the cafeteria is all fresh and delish try out their corn bread and also the grilled fish Even if I'm not planning to buy anything new for my place I simply love to walk around just for the exercise and to admire anything new they have out.
This place only gets better - nice to have all the extra room since they expanded and it still maintains that funky urban vibe with interesting furniture - we sat on cardboard chairs - and the best Cappucinos in the Valley.
I don't usually write reviews preferring to lurk However I feel that something is definitely up with all the recent positive reviews on this placeLet me say that many years ago my husband and I loved this place  However after last night we will never frequent again  I will preface with the previous time we ate there (and ate in) and the veggie pizza we ordered arrived with raw vegetables (raw and COLD) all over the top  We sent it back thinking the kitchen was having an off night and thought no further of it until last night  We ordered a pizza for takeout and I picked it up  It was their NY pizza and we ordered it as listed with extra cheese and well done (regular crust)   When they brought it out I looked at it first and I couldn't believe it  The top was covered with raw bell pepper - big giant chunks of it  It wasn't even close to well done and I askedthis is well done  The vacuous server said yes that's well done (she didn't even look)  I said the vegetables aren't even cooked and are barely warm  Also where's the extra cheese  She and the girl behind the counter both gave me professional smile number 2 and said it's thereit's well doneI told them it would be my last visit and left  They were not in the tiniest bit interested in customer satisfaction nor the quality of their pizzas  I did take it home as it had already been paid for and (night before thanksgiving) had no other dinner options at the time  But after getting it home It got worsethe center of the pizza was wet  I don't mean gooey but wet like someone had spilled water on it  We took what we could out of the box and cooked it on our pizza stone but suffice to say it was not a happy experienceIs this restaurant coasting on it's past  I think so  Will leave it to the sheople.
Here's a tip don't eat here The food was bland and cold The cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't even melted It was a tortilla full of cold shredded cheese Also the refried beans were awful -- I've had instant refried beans that held their consistency betterWe waited 20 minutes for this "food" and there were only three other occupied tablesAlso this is the only place I've ever been to that when you order "chips and salsa" puts the salsa ON the chips If you can call it salsa -- chopped tomato and onion with cilantro barely even qualifies as Pico de gallo it sure as hell isn't salsa But thanks for making my chips soggyThis is the first Filiberto's I've been to I'll try another just to rule out one pathetic location But I'm never going back to this one.
I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town They have a wide variety of bagels cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable They also have really good lemonade :)Overall if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop check this place out Oh and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too.
This is a five star for me  I am an artist that has participated since day one  I have watched this artist showing grow from the beginning  It is great for several reasonsthe artists are new and innovsative the bands all along the walk give it a great groove the people that run it really do care  I wouldn't miss it either as an artist or attendee  You will find something special that makes great for you too.
Totally disappointed I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu Took me a minute to figure out why but once I did since I was there I thought I'd try something Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that has mustard too perfect way to eat a hot dog Shakes were on sale so i got a chocolate one The shake was ok it didn't make it back to the office but not because it was 'awesome' it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had Got to the office opened the bag pulled out the hotdog and well was quite disappointed The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut That is not what I got I got a hotdog in a BUN with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard Ok so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side so i was expecting as such That's how the photo looked but no no dog sticking out took me two bites each end to find the hot dog and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless Won't go there again.
Went to Joe's last night  Not my first time at all but my first time seeing the expansion and it looks AMAZING  I love it  The place looks amazing the employees are always so nice and are so helpful and friendly and the bands (especially Money Shot) are awesome  I HIGHLY recommend going to Joes  It is a great place to make your usual hang out.
I had been to Fuego Bistro before and really enjoyed it  So I was really looking forward to trying Fuego Cityscape with a Groupon I had bought  The food is absolutely delicious I had the Pernil Torta with the Sweet Potato fries the meet was soo amazing completely melt in your mouth and paired with the cabbage it was to die for  My friend had the quesadilla with Carne Asada he said it was very good  We also had the Key Lime Pie for dessert and it was awesome I love key lime anything and this did not dissapoint definitely one of the best key lime things I've had I also had the Prickly Pear Mojito which was a beautiful pinkish/purplish color  I enjoyed it very muchSam was our waiter and he was fantastic  He was getting ready for a table of 9 and he still managed to keep us and everyone else extremely happy  I was very impressed with his friendliness and expediting to make sure everyone had drinks and there food when it came out  I can't wait to go back again.
I am a Sephora Insider because I frequent Sephora all the time I recently had my free makeover done by Heather and Yvette at Sephora They did a fabulous job It was so great I don't usually like when people do my makeup since I am really fussy They listened to exactly what I wanted and made me look flawless I recommend getting all your beauty needs at Sephora.
T Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture gardens water fountains patio and charming walk-ways and courtyard The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming reflective mood I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms I've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone but was mistaken lol Anyways I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad too which is flavorful and has great texture But if you're looking for one appetizer to try definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo My mouth just started watering It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars)As for the main course:-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars I'm not much of a duck person but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender-Wood roasted "Pulet Rouge" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor which I appreciate I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure)-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time) nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really goodI want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting The bar area is also super sexy sleek and mysterious They usually have a live piano player at night I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert It's become my escape to mini paradise.
They serve the best egg drop soup I have ever had and I have egg drop soup countless times at more Asian restaurants than I could count   The base is traditionalBut they add ground chicken some of which is suspended in a delicious broth and some form delightful small dumplings that float amid carrot and peas  Our office manager was raving about it so I had to check it out   And what a surprise to the pallet     I enjoyed their spring rolls as well   Their luncheon menu offers a wide variety of chicken shrimp pork and beef specials between five and six dollars  All are tastey  Another co-worker loves the orange chicken  I like the moo goo gai pan  The service is very friendly and fast which is good thing  when your time is liimited on an office lunch hour   I look forward to visiting after work for a leisurely dinner to enjoy both their tastey entrees and conversation  Go there and be sure to order the egg drop soup   You will become a regular like I have   See you there.
I had heard great things about this place and was so excited to try it  Soooooo glad that I did  :) The decor of the place is simple but there is a nice patio seating area so that you can enjoy the weather  I think I was a Pavlovian dog while waiting in line to place my order  I chose two enchiladas one with pork green chili and the other a potato and cornbread mixture  Smothered in a green chili sauce and baked to perfection Definitely add the fried egg on top it makes everything taste yummy.
If your looking for pepperoni pizza then don't come heremellow mushroom offers toppings that you would only dream of putting on pizzasalmost any type of topping you can think of they will likely have.
I'd never had the pleasure of visiting Aiello's until last night As a dining destination for New Year's Eve with a very dear friend I hadn't seen for years it was superb I agree with all the positive reviews which already reside here The food (calamarilobster raviolilinguini fradiavolo) was all terrific and the Cabernet was just right Kudos to the hostess - we had reservations and were seated immediately Our waiter was attentive but not intrusive It was a little noisy in the dining room (NYE after all) but not obnoxiously so And Joe He's a card and a genuinely nice guyTwo snaps up and I can't wait to go back.
I have nothing but good things to say about this salon  I have been going to For Nails Only for several months  The people are very friendly and they make me feel welcome  They do a quality job and don't rush through the work  I always feel relaxed and happy when leaving  Thank you.
$5 parking + $8 lawn seats + good friends + old style + spring baseball + entertaining people watching = a perfect afternoon.
Two more trips since my last review and I still stand at 5 stars Both times were with groups of friends  On one of my ventures here I was with a group who decided to try the family style  We had 2 fish dinners (amok & the mango) both were very very delicious  Loved the flavorings  We also had a couple of the chicken dishes and a cold sliced beef with vegetablesI suggested to the 2nd group since they were not familiar with Cambodian foods to order family style   Since I know pretty much what I like I wanted to order my own  I ordered the fish mango again  Had my standard mango bo bo and ended up taking about half my fish home for a late night snackWill be returning next week again with another group of eaters  LOLNever tasted anything here that I didn't like  I guess that the fish is my favorite It is a hard choice thoughService is excellent but just be prepared especially with groups that the food is prepared fresh and it may take some time before you get your dish  They do not bring all dishes at once as that would involve them sitting in the kitchen while they prepare the other dishes Nobody wants food that has stood and is not hotWhat else can I say except that I just LOVE eating here and will keep recommending it to my groups of friendsI just keep coming back.
Try the potato cream cheese bread bowl or chicken pesto sandwich Then relax in Changing Hands afterwardperfect date night.
Fantastic Loved every part of my meal huge portions great drinks and fairly priced Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait Just have to pick the right days I guess.
I write this because I actually care about this place Gameworks opened in 1997 I was actually part of the opening crew I only worked there about 6 months but I loved it so much I would make it my weekly haunt for several years  At that time Gameworks kept up with the gaming market which of course has gone down severely since console and computer gaming has become more popular However Gameworks was never a game room or an arcade For the first year that it was opened you could have money deducted from your paycheck if you referred to Gameworks as either one of those in the presence of a manager Gameworks was an experience It's originating concept was what would happen if a bunch of 90's tweens were to find an old abandoned building that was powered by "Surge" soda The magical new super caffeinated mountain dew alternative for tweens living the extreme  The credit system they used was supposed to be easy on parents and tweens alike Mom or Dad could buy a card that could be used in every part of Gameworks excluding the bar That way a kid didn't have to carry around actual money and could play games get a burger and fries drink some SURGE ectect  Video games had cup holders and fries were served in cups so kids could snack as they played Upstairs there was a coffee bar a regular bar and a full restaurant They had leather couches and chairs in parts of the bar and coffee bar They had an area for retro 80's games Most importantly they had two special attractions known as Vertical Reality and the INDY 500 In the middle of the upstairs they had a professional sound and video board with some of the latest equipment available at the time They had actual DJ's that were called Play Jockeys controlling video and audio feeds to the 5 different quadrants of the building During the initial year of opening I witnessed lines outside the door of people trying to get in the door  They had over a thousand people riding the indy 500 hundred  each week during the summer They had contest with great prizes like Superbowl tickets Harley Davidson and one Halloween they gave away a stand up House of the Dead arcade game Now the decline-Every company has a vision and talking points that they pass off as their do's and don'ts Gameworks always wanted  to have staff available to assist people The first notice of decline of course was under staffing No longer were people greeting others giving them a random free play on the games Instead of running multiple lines of Vertical reality which had multiple bays they would only keep open one or two  Instead of having announcers always stationed at indy 500 a sign was put in place that said see attendant for assistance  Secondly the one golden rule they swore they would never ever ever EVER BREAK Gameworks will never have redemption games Tickets were considered evil instead they had a gift shop where you could buy things like shirts shot glasses and all kinds of other crap you could possibly find as prizes at other places  They day I walked in and saw the first game spitting tickets and the words redemption I felt I was kicked in the nuts The final straw would be the multiple changes to the bar Certain liquors beers ect were gone Certain specialty drinks gone Great bartenders gone Happy hour host and play jockey's gone The music is now a loop the play Jockey audio and visual station is not used Last time I was in there the bartenders were using jigs had no flair and most importantly were more concerned with trying to  get the one girl who was in the bar to talk to them instead of making money by serving drinks up selling and keeping conversation with multiple patrons Gone was the once warm inviting atmosphere and instead I felt like I was having a drink poured for me by a 21 year old holding a liquor bottle for the first time At this point the once great establishment that I have spent thousands of dollars at between 97 and 2007 has become a poor depressing shell of what it once was You could actually close the bar get rid of the restaurant and put a pizza place upstairs and they could probably pull off a chucky cheese gig and be more profitable then what they appear to me Opportunities for improvement-It is my firm belief that Gameworks has the chance to reinvent themselves if they would try a radical approach  At this time they have at least 3 or 4 great spaces that they could potentially use for LAN gaming and console gaming It would very easy to set up multiple consoles and a internal LAN and do a pay for the hour or day thing Much like Howie's game shack in mesa riverview They also need to go back to the night club ambiance after 8pm Bring back the play jockeys and the hostesses Bring back that feeling of warmthUpdate as of  7/21/13Attraction rides have been taken out Many of the non-redemption games looked in horrible shape Seemed like nothing but driving and redemption games #Sad -1 star.
The House is just how it sounds It is amazing that Matt Carter(Zinc Bistro and Mission) continues to evolve So comforting and service was amazinng especially considering it has only been open a few weeks King crab and smoked gouda fondue Roasted Halibut and the Lamb Bolognese was suprisinglyreally good the lemon marscopone and mint worked fantastically Patio is amazing weather permitting.
One of the best places to bring visiting guests Go early as they do not take reservations Happy hour is 3-5 T-F with buck 50 tacosLong story shortalthough the tableside guacamole is "fun" skip it so you have room for everything else including the churro dessert Portions are not enormous but decentThis is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant Everything is gourmet and fabulous with attention to detail I don't consider $20 for an amazing entree to be too expensiveWe usually go here only for special occasions or if we have out of town guests I'm hoping we'll go once a week until I've had everything on the menu.
Breakfast several times Always fast friendly service  Great food just really like this place  I must add We don't go at prime time -10 am on Saturday or Sunday We go early like 8 am : ) no wait whatsoever.
We Love Fresh WasabiThey have a happy hour that starts at 2pm We had the sweet thang salmon nigiri and our favorite the cherry blossom $2500 for two peopleWow on Price and QualityAnd as always we get the fresh wasabiOur favorite Sushi place on the west side.
Stopped by for lunch today and loved it Quick attentive service and the food was excellent I had the sushi lunch with a salad added Simple salad and the dressing is sooo yummy - just perfect Spicy Tuna Sushi was the best I ever had Hubby chose the tempura and a salmon and avocado sashimi - he thought it was spectacular I am sure we will be there again and again in the future - what a find.
Great sandwiches and rootbeer floatsI will return for sure.
Wow a movie should be watched this way.
Awful experience My girlfriend and I just wanted a quick bite that wouldn't make us feel like crap so we fell for the Applebee's ad for low calorie options We got there and we're seated near the door despite there being plenty of room in the restaurant They seated a man who appeared to be homeless and providing his own beverage choices (he poured a clear liquid into his water glass) We didn't get to order for about 15 minutes We both ordered an under 500 calorie meal and neither of us finished it It looked like a diet microwave meal dumped on the plate Some of the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery while others were undercooked and translucent  Not going back even though it is just down the street.
Love this place I first discovered it when it was off Scottsdale Road and had to track them down at their new location off McDowell and 74th Street We love specialty root beer and this place is great for any kind of specialty sodas We bought a small keg of Sonoran Brew Root Beer for the kids for a party and they loved it I haven't been back in some time and I'll have to take the kids and let them go wild in this soda and candy heaven.
Went to Chuckbox yesterday with my dad hadn't been there since the early '90's when I was a student at ASU I don't think ANYTHING has changed there and that's a good thing Still the worlds best burger Although I can't handle a great big one as easily as I did back in the day I went to Smash Burger for the first time a few weeks ago and it's mighty good My dad and I decided we had to make a trek back to Chuckbox to decide who has the best burger We both agreed it's pretty much a tie Different tasting burgers VERY different environments both outstandingMy dad's comment was that Smashburger tastes 'corporate' and Chuckbox tastes homemade If I had guests from out of town we'd go to Chuckbox every time.
This review is a bit lateI first stayed at the Boulders back in 2004 when it was owned by Wyndam Hotels I have visited 10 times in the last ten years I usually stay in the resort homes I have never had a bad experience They provide the best customer serviceI recently traveled there in September Andrea is the reservationist that booked us a fabulous house and gave us a great rate It was above and beyond of what I thought I would get Patty in housekeeping took all my calls and sent out great people to assist us The room service food is greatMy first massage at the spa was just ok The rest of my treatments were a bit better but I don't feel they are worth the price You have to sign your receipt with 20 percent tip before your treatment It's no longer the Golden Door Spa but a Hilton spa Always ask about a special for treatmentsGo to the big mall in Scottsdale and shop .
Went in here without knowing much about cigars and the person working was very helpful and pointed us to affordable delicious cigars  The shop itself is very nice and brand new and features a bar and a room to smoke in as well with large TVs  Great place.
Great to finally have a high end NIke store in town This store is smaller than Niketown locations in other cities but they pack a lot into the two-story space Most of the square footage is allocated to golf tennis and running but the basketball training and Nike sportswear sections provide ample variety The store carries a majority of the current hot/limited releases and an abundance of color ways of the most popular running basketball and training shoes The clothing selection is great at well and I saw lots of t-shirts shorts jackets etc that I haven't seen elsewhere I'll definitely be a regular at this store.
My husband and I had to attend a family reunion in the Phoenix area and we wanted to make a mini-vacation out of it and decided to stay at the Wigwam  We had a wonderful spacious quiet clean room/suite overlooking the golf courses and the patio was particularly relaxing to sit out on in the evenings  Our room also had a small fridge that came in very handy and there was a fireplace that looked very cozy (we may just have to come back in the winter to try it out)  It was great that we could have our dog stay in the room with us and my husband enjoyed golfing both mornings we were there - Gold Course & Blue Course All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and check-in and check-out were both very smooth and fast  We had breakfast one morning at Red's which was very good and very inexpensive for the buffet especially and it looked like it has a pretty nice bar in there too  We are really looking forward to planning another getaway to the Wigwam.
Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19 Yay dealWe enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread with caramelized onions added Scrumptious We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell but you think it could really be something special That's how I'm feeling about Timo I hope it's love.
Man I hate this location I've been going to la fitness for 10+ years now and never had a problem I recently moved next to this location and was excited to start training here since it's almost twice the size of the other la fitness i was going too After training here for a month I've had enough #1Every time I walk in this place there is always one or two male workers flirting with the girl who scans you in giving me the dirtiest look #2 YOU CANT BRING A GYM BAG IN THE GYM This is the only la fitness I've seen that does this I'm a pretty serious lifter and there are certain things I need with me (straps belt chalk) let alone my keys phone and wallet Usually I bring my bag anyway but within a few minutes management will ask me to remove it or leave it in the locker room which is on the other side of the gym I've asked the manager why they do this he claims it keeps the floors clear but if I bring every individual thing in my bag in the gym apparently that's ok (wtf)#3 The hours suck They close at 10 on Friday and 8 on Saturday and Sunday This is also the only on la fitness I've seen do thisApparently this location goes by it's own rules which is it's downfall I'm more than happy to drive to a further location than to go to this pos gym.
We take our schnauzer and our long haired dachshund here and they do an excellent job with both Never had any complaints about service or quality of work in the 4 or so times we have gone there Also there is (or was) a discount for school teachers Prompt service good  work cheap prices Not much else you can ask for Easier to get an appointment in the summer when all the snowbirds have left with their sundry lap dogs.
What a great surprise This little inconspicuous hole in the wall could be transported directly out of Tokyo Polished concrete floors single white bar simple 2 seater tables and blue neon light to illuminate the white bar chairs The menu not quite the Japanese fare one might be used to No sushi but great little creations like duck and wontons The best part about this place must be the bar A incredible Sake selection and infused vodka buffet If you are into Sake or truly flavoured mixed drinks the bar will be your heaven I am glad I was recommended this place and actually stumbled into it What a great find.
Love this place  I hit it about once a month to avoid giving all my hard earned $$ to big shops like Bass Pro etc  There's plenty of high end gear and a pretty good selection of terminal and soft baits  The best thing about this shop is the old school vibe  There are usually a few older guys sitting up front (not employees) reading newspapers talking trash etc  Kind of a barber shop deal  Also if you want some help and an almost guaranteed laugh ask Jeep for help  The dude totally knows his fishing and he's got a wry sense of humor which he never fails to break out on me  Also when he's ringing up my items he nonchalantly knocks 10-15% off of everything I'm buying which doesn't suck at all  Great local business great people totally legit  Can't believe there aren't more reviews on here  5 stars  Time to go fishing now.
Wow  Twelve days FOUR new Super Buffets  Arlin B joined me today to whip over to this one for their Grand Opening  It's a beautiful place & was featuring about 136 food items not counting sauces & dressings  The food was delicious & I particularly liked the Sushi here  very tasty  There's a Mongolian BBQ the table service was friendly & attentive all the trays were being kept stocked & there were no shortcomings at all for me  In fact this is my favorite of all four of the brand new ones:  Crazy Buffet in Mesa Fuji Buffet (remodeled & reopened) Mandarin Super Buffet on Bethany Home & this oneWith these four now up & running one on the way having bombed out (Hibachi Grill on Bell Rd) two other Hibachis are under construction to replace it plus another China City so we still have 3 more new Super Buffets coming to the Valley this year  Meanwhile 5 Stars for this one     :-)).
You will never have a better sub then eating a sub at Firehouse.
Been going here for years Always get the same thing for my husband when kids and I have eaten already I bring him the mojarra frita and it's always been consistently delicious People are friendly too.
I have to say i really love this place I live just a few blocks away and it is very nice to have a cleannice place so close by I have gone there many times now and have never had a bad experience They send out some fantastic coupons  Only one time did i go through the drive thrui usually always get out of the car and go in  The store is always very clean which you can not say at the Mac Donald's 2 doors down They always acknowledge you when you come in but not in an annoying way  Very friendly and fast service They can answer questions about their products and I really like the coffee I just drink the plain black coffee nothing in it So i can say the flavor is really good A lot of places in this neighborhood do not make it It is a little rough over here  So i am very glad that they are here  Oh another plus they do not put the napkins on lock down You can help yourself.
Great Happy Hour Menu and wonderful staff and service  The Happy Hour Menu now takes place from 4pm to 6pm  Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks  The La Hacienda and Prickley pear margaritas are really good  If you are willing to try something new other than your normal Tequila ask for Danielle the Tequila Goddess she is a wealth of knowledge and she will definitely guide you in the right direction  Try the Don Julio 1942 tequila its a sipper not straight shot so enjoy yourself.
It's been over 4 weeks and the "we owe" which they said would be taken care of has yet to be done or settled with me They are very unprofessional and more importantly dis honest I plan on filing a claim with the better business bureau next STAY AWAY.
Willow Stream Spa in the Scottsdale Fairmont Princess is my all-time favorite spaI suppose for that to matter it requires some context And yes I've been to more than a few spas That's because (1) I love spas and (2) I've been lucky enough to be a magazine travel writer and editor of health and spa magazines for years So I have spa'd in and out of the country and on most cruise lines I've done day spas and "stay" spas I've been to Japanese spas a Thai spa in Canada the ultimate Ayurveda spa in Fairfield Iowa  and my most recent massage was at Halele'a Spa in the St Regis Princeville on Kauai which Conde Nast just named a top spa for 2010 So I don't name my favorite spa lightly We moved to Scottsdale less than two years ago and I love everything about it But beyond the weather and great dining and outdoor hot spots it is absolutely spa heavenWhen we bought a house down the street from the Fairmont last year I was sure that their spa was too expensive for regular visits despite being just a lovely stroll away But I've averaged well over a visit a month between gift certificates from friends spa weeks and the spa's own specialsOthers have detailed the great features so I won't belabor that my favorites are the wet room the inhalation room and the rooftop pool with free cabanas What a beautiful place to enjoy an Arizona sunset The amenities are all truly free and unlimited It's always a half-day experience for me A full vacation right down the roadSpa week can be way too crowded This year I tried a Saturday evening and I'll never do that again But it is spa week that made me a regular so I can't complain about others discovering this great value I'll just be sure and do weekdays only I've never had a bad massage here My spa week sessions have never skimped on quality I don't know how those wonderful therapists do it I have had a couple of very irritating moments with the front desk at the spa So much so that my cursor hovered over the stars considering removing one So it wasn't minorBut I booked my next appointment this morning and had a wonderful person on the phone so hopefully this one dark smudge is being addressed.
Awesome ice cream  They had such an extensive menu and it was delicious Come hungry.
This is my spot for a business meeting in North Phoenix I have also taken my family here a few times for our normal Sunday lunchThe place is really decorated nicely not "over the top" cheap Japanese stuff conservative and very nicely done Casual and comfortable The service and staff are awesome The variety of the rolls are awesome Want something you don't see The chef's will make it for you They know almost all the various names and ingredients of most rollsPrices are really good One catch - they serve canned soda (as of 742012) so refills are not free No biggie for me but someone reading this may careNOTE: I use this place all the time for business meetings Since I am normally there for 2+ hours I make it worth the wait staffs time and tip appropriately While we have never spoken about it they know that I will cut the meeting short pack up and leave if I see the place filling up (have done it a few times) I think this is common courtesy and wish more "mobile-office" people would do the same.
We love this location Samantha is a great serverShe's fast friendly and always is smiling no matter how busy it isWe usually get a bottle of wine and 2 slices Always excellent.
Outstanding service will always be going back for the dinner Thank you Liberty Market for our date night.
I also want to add my very positive feedback about my experience with Josiah and Dirtball Customs  I took my 2007 GS to him for some minor servicing that I just couldn't get right (throttle body synch and the related valve adjustment) and he not only did those services for a very fair price but also looked over the bike very carefullyThanks again Josiah  Your prices are fantastic for labor and I will see you next month when I replace the tires on my GS.
The food here is always delicious I have never had to wait to be seated The service is great and every server I have had there was quick attentive and not annoying The restaurant is intimate and I always feel relaxed there We ordered the cornbread which was awesome I have to say I don't usually eat salads at all But when I read what the Macho Salad had in it I decided to give it a try and wow it was excellent It had avocado roasted chicken chopped almonds and goat cheese I never like salads but this one is incredible I love it I get it everytime I go A family member of mine always gets the Bandera- Style roasted chicken which is always good and roasted to perfection I have gone here a couple times and each time it has been excellent.
This is a wonderful place to take your pets - they give outstanding care to your animals All the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and Dr Pruden is so gentle and caring My dog has had valley fever for a few years now and she has kept me in the loop all the way explaining all the options available discussing everything fully and making sure I know what needs to be done and why This is a place I would recommend to anyone who values who looks after their pet's health.
I went to this business many years ago and would not go any where else  This time I can't even get through the door  First I called several times leaving messages that were not returned until some called and left me a half-hearted message saying I am just calling in case some else didn't call you  Knowing their past reputation I kept trying until I got someone on the phone and made an appt  They called and confirmed my appt for today  We showed up with our pet on time for our appt and waited on hour outside and no one showed  They obviously do not need any new business or they would honor people's time  My husband has a job as I do I and we do have the time to wait  We called their number there was no message that there had been an emergency.
Food was great and service was absolutely awesome  Best ever  Thanks Lauren.
After owning my home for 9 years and hiring various people including some highly advertised plumbing companies some individual contractors and several handymen  - I feel that I have finally found the best of all the rest   The reviewers were not exaggerating  Not only did Mike give a very reasonable quote but in addition to doing the work that I had hired him for he fixed a couple of other things that had been done incorrectly by a previous handyman   His hourly rate is right up front on his website and the time that he estimated was more than it took to do the work so my cost was less  How rare is that  There are not enough adjectives to describe but they would include fair honest capable efficient and personable plus he was on-time  I would highly recommend Mike and now have the peace of mind of having someone to call who I trust when I need work done on my home.
Everyone is so friendly in particular Myra in the Impulse department  She's always friendly and has a good eye for fashion  She has no problem telling me what looks good on me and what doesn't  She's never pressured me into buying anything and for that I keep going back - been over 2 years  I love this location  It's always so clean and the layout is easy on the eyes  I don't get overwhelmed when I walk in    I agree with others when the selections are as big as other locations but their level of customer service by far stand out  Having a Starbuck's at this location and a handful of coupons is always a good day.
This has been my favorite place to eat for years but over the last few months it has gone completly downhill and after last night we will not be returningMy fiancé and I went wen with a friend and 3 young kids for an early dinner and asked for split checksFood was so so service was extremely slow and only checked on us once And when the bills came we were charged an automatic gratuity because of our party size eve if half were kids and it was separate tickets They also charged for things they never have before like guacamole and kids drinksThis loyal customer is done $65 for 2 adults and kids for dinner I don't think so.
Sprouts  Happylots of organic and natural foodthey tell you where their produce comes frombulk productsI'm not sure why I don't shop here every week.
I love coming to this place The food is delicious and alway consistent If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed Best breakfast spot in C-town However the service isn't the best But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots.
This is the best starbucks in Scottsdale  They are always super friendly and my drink is always perfect  Keep up the good work.
There are so many "Berto's" in Phoenix that it's not even funny  Humberto's is next door to my rinky dink apartment  So it's convenient  I went in expecting to find a typical dive  However this place was clean and there was a lone man in there manning the grill  I immediately ordered my "safe" meal - a Carne Asada Burrito I was happy to see the man toss some raw meat onto the grille and make it fresh  He took great care in putting chili in it and then slapped it into a huge tortilla  He also put a MOUNTAIN of guacamole into it which was the only downfall  I will next time as for cheese instead  So I ate it and it was good  It was very big and filling as well  I will be returning to this place time and time again.
In N Out Burger is hands down the best fast food place I've ever eaten at The food actually tastes good unlike most mass fast food chains The burgers are to die for as are the fries I love how everything is made fresh daily and the fries are cut in the store The one thing I don't like is how it seems everyone in Phoenix seemed to be at this location when I was there I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot It was worth it though Hands down In N Out is one of the best burger places in America Now they just need to come to the Great Lakes region.
Stopped in here one night right before Christmas  Short and sweet:Margaritas - very good (and huge by the way)Tacos - awesomeGuacamole - excellentService - 5 starsLove this place  If you haven't gone here you are missing out on a great little place here in Phoenix.
My sister and I went to this Home Depot to buy blinds for my new house  The salespeople were all awesome - not too clingy but always around when you needed them to be  They were able to cut my blinds same-day even though there were a LOT of cuts to be made  Now I happily have 8 new blinds to install.
The St Francis is great  Food and drinks are very good and their happy hour is the best  Love the atmosphere and is a great place for drinking and dinning outside.
First best Cosmo in town Seriously Poured on balls of dry ice which keeps it cold not too sweet and they leave the shaker so you can finish it off Love the garlic toast in the bread basket The tuna tower on the appetizer list is enough for an entree Great steaks and seafood selections and don't forget the double pork chop But the creme de la creme is the Butter Cake - not to be missed.
I Love Love Love Oregano's  When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panicThe food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful and my staple  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE  Like I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes  Still I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys  The salads are great the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough.
My new favorite spot Thanks Yelp We ordered the molcajete  with diablo sauce - be warned it really is spicy Not called diablo for nothing The flavor was still there and I love spicy but next time I'll try the tomatillo Bit too painful for me ( I ordered a horchata to try and help numb my swollen tongue)I really love the side of beanssalad and rice Beans are perfectly seasoned salad is tangy and refreshing and the rice has texture Not the pink puffy rice with minimal flavor that is served at so many mexican restaurantsThey also have strong margaritas and huge mugs of draft beerJust seeing the pictures makes me want to go there now.
Great food every time we have been there golf or no golf this is a great destination for a fine meal Doesn't hurt that we can walk there for dinner.
I love Nielsen's Both locations are very nice The food is good quality and the employees seem very efficient and industrious I love the "Finer Things" sandwichAn aside (which does not affect my rating): Many of the people here don't control their children - almost every time I have gone to either Nielsen's there are kids going crazy It's worth it for the food though.
Best craft beer joint in Phoenix No one else is brewing beer as imaginative as this The 4 Leaf Irish Red is surprisingly refreshing I loved the Dark Knight Porter - and not just because of the Batman reference But it was the seasonals that blew me away - especially the black IPA (And who else in Phoenix is brewing a Cascadian dark ale by the way) The food options are limited but it is a working brewery after all Bottom line: If you wanna taste some truly great beer this is the place to go.
Bottom line: any theatre that brings Rocky Horror back to Mill Ave gets 5 stars just for that (See I'm not hard to please)And they showed Showgirls here the other night I MISSED IT () but again any theatre that shows Showgirls on Mill Ave gets 5 stars They also do live music performances and about a million other cool things here but for me it's all about Rocky Horror I think (ie hope) that MADCAP signals a change back to the "old" Mill Ave The things that are going on here are the best reuse of this old building Thank you to all the people who made this happen.
Best vegan option in the valley  Love that I can go out to eat and still be healthy  I almost always order one of the specials love the variety.
Now on my third time eating here since I found it a few weeks back and everything is amazing I a big fan of homemade middle eastern food an have been spoiled with it because family and friends would make it (my grandpa made hummus tabouli and falafel) this place does it right I have tried the gyro kifta hummus tabouli and more and it has all been great My true judge of a mid-eastern place is the hummus since I love it and have been making my own for as long as I can remember This stuff is great right combo of flavors and good bread to boot My only knock is it's a but creamier than I like and a bit less garlic(but I love super extra garlic so I can't hold that against them) Overall it's just right and I will devour it The meats are all flavorful and moist (especially rare with most other gyros) The tabouli is a nice mix of greens and wheat with a ton of fresh flavorsPlain in simple if you like mid-eastern food go here you won't regret it Try the combination meal and get a bit of all the good stuff.
Love this place Great staff killer music and delicious sushi Tiffany and Adrian  behind the bar are awesome & NOTHING beats their happy hour.
We had dinner reservations for our anniversary on a Sunday at 7:15pm  We arrived about 10 minutes early and we were seated immediately with our choice of booth or table  The waitress (a younger girl) was very nice and patient while we decided on drinks and dinner  She kindly answered all of my questions about the menu and was polite when I still needed another minute to decide  I ordered the Farmer's Daughter Drink and it was delicious  (It comes in a martini glass)  At first the waitress' assistant was refilling out water and soda every few minutes (not anywhere near empty even) then by the end of dinner we were waiting for more water  Not a ding on the restaurant just weirdFor dinner my husband got the bone in rib-eye medium rare it was cooked perfectly  I ordered the Sunday Prime Rib dinner that came with a 12 oz prime rib with au jus horseradish sauce and the peppercorn sauce - (I also requested some bearnaise sauce no charge) a salad choice of any full sized side dish and a full size dessert all for $3895  I chose the Fleming's potatoes and chocolate lava cake  The potatoes were good but basically just scalloped potatoes with a hint of jalapeno in them  The lava cake was delicious soft and gooey  My husband ordered the chipotle mac & cheese which was very good better than the potatoes in our opinion I just hate spending $950 on mac and cheese  At the end of our meal the waitress brought a "gift from the chef" for our anniversary which was a box of 4 large truffles and a $25 gift card good on your next visit in the dining room only at this location only.
PERFECTIONBest restaurant in AZ hands down It is over the top From the moment you walk in the service the execution of the food the wine pairings the artistry of the menu from the moment you leave - a handwritten thank you note water and chocolates in your car Everything is on point Pure artistry and close attention to every detail Very very expensive but worth it The price point will probably keep me from becoming a regular but I very much look forward to returning again.
This is a great Yard House  My first experience at a Yard House was a few years ago at the one in the Scottsdale mall and well that was obnoxious  Not so much the Yard House but the people  Anyways moving onThis Yard House has a great vibe about it  There's plenty of seating inside but the selling point with this location is the outdoor seating that wraps around the restaurant with plenty of heat lamps  Being that it's tucked behind Margaritaville it's a great place to sit and people watch at night  I had the Mac and Cheese which is to die for and probably the best adult mac and cheese on the planet and then I headed inside to the bar for a whiskey  Of all places in Westgate the people I ran into here were super friendly and easy to talk to  The bartenders were really friendly and I ended up staying a couple hours as the patrons at the bar didn't have the attitude as some of the neighboring restaurants and everybody was chatty  It was a fun experience  The lighting is a little dimmer inside than some restaurants but it sets the tone for the place and it works  The Yard House in general has some of the absolute best food around  If you are in the Westgate area it's a must stop for dinner or drinks.
My son absolutely loves this place (I do too)He said "tigers blood is the most best flavor I think" You can get a mini sno ball for 75 cents which is perfect for the little ones I'll admit that the owner can be a little "cold" but he has passion for his product and knows his stuff.
Green flannel was delicious as was the fresh squeezed orange juice My husband had the banana nut cakes and also loved them  We had great service and the servers actually seemed happy to be working here which is a nice change of pace Will definitely return.
Another great Pat's Run One of the best t-shirts I've ever gotten from a run before too Sold-out again this year but somehow it seemed a little more organized and let people know what to expect Three water stations along the route and water bananas and oranges at the end There were also some outside sponsors there handing out freebies-I did have a refreshing smoothie from jamba juice Cool finish line inside Sun Devil stadium that's probably the best part Along with being there with all those thousands of people for a great cause.
My boyfriend friends and I are a part of the PBR Bowling League held at this location every Sunday night The employees are GREAT Very welcoming and accommodating Food is awesome especially for a bowling alley and we ALWAYS have a blast (Might not bowl great all the time but we never leave disappointed with service and hospitality) Go Team  :D.
I almost don't want to tell you guys about this place Such is my greed to have a seat when I go back Think "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" as far as the smallness and inconspicuousness of the place (in a strip mall) But just like in "Jiro" (who's place is tucked away in the Tokyo subway) this place delivers big on sushi satisfaction Prices are very solid for what you get We were going to get some straight sashimi but the bento boxes looked so good and were such an amazing value we went that way Salmon teriyaki 6-piece sashimi rice soup and salad The sashimi came out first SEPARATE from the bento box It was not an after-thought it was in a bowl on it's own bed of ice and was amazing and fresh The chef also sent over a complimentary creamy cucumber and crab salad with sesame seeds that was out of this world The service was so friendly that it felt like we'd been there before To top it all off they also gave us a complimentary mochi and whip cream dessert at the end of the meal that took me to sushi/japanese cuisine nirvana It's hard to squeeze 5 stars out of me but this place did I can imagine doing a "Groundhog Day" (remember Bill Murray in that) where I came back to this place every day at the same time forever and that would be just fine Save me a seat I'm coming back.
Love this place I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here They serve quality gourmet food And they have a full bar too Place is clean and service is great Would go back anytime.
Best place in town.
What better way is the to spend a Tuesday night than with an amazing yelp event and friends The bingo event was so much fun I couldn't believe that I actually found someone who has visited Australia  I apologize to all hose people that had to put up with my imitation kookaburra laugh and song  The new bar menu was a tasty treat that doesn't disappoint My favorite thing of the night had to be the spinach artichoke chicken flatbread  The nachos were a close second  I only got to try the rum punch but it was delicious  The Mescato margarita and appletini drinks all looked like the could be gobbled up  Our table's server Nicole D was phenomenal Extremely friendly and personable and always willing to do a little bit more to make the evening great  I look forward to visiting them again so that I can try some if the things that I missed.
Went here to celebrate my birthday with some of my hot babe friends which happened to be cinco de mayo  Rachel was our bartender/server  She is very friendly and helpful  We asked for her recommendations as to what was popular and good  There was seven of us so we had an opportunity to try quite a few items on the menu   We ordered the fried sausage ravioli the coconut chicken tenders the chicken lettuce wraps tempura vegetable medley and the chef's sliders all from the appetizer menu  We also tried the mac 'n cheese with bacon and the pork chop dinner  She makes a great French martini  I must admit I didn't like the margarita  I guess it's cause I don't like it with ice and I like more salt on the rim but probably my fault since I didn't tell her I didn't want it on ice  Everything was fabulous but if you're going to order anything absolutely a must is the mac 'n cheese with the bacon  The bacon really adds to it  And the pork dinner had the right amount of "gravy"  I don't know if I could even call it gravy but we were practically licking the plates of the mac 'n cheese and the pork  I really liked the ravioli and the sliders  Since I'm not all that big on fried food all I can say is that they were good for fried food but it wouldn't be something I personally would order  But that's me  Just like I wouldn't order lamb but we won't go there  I'd absolutely return  reBAR is across the patio and is the bar  We dropped in there to see what it looked like.
OF COURSE five stars for the Phoenix Suns I'm psyched I can Yelp about them Born and raised in Arizona I was taught to support the suns from a young age I always had fun going to the games when I was young and I still do Going to a game is great way to have fun and I guarantee the suns put on a great game weather they win or lose Obviously I'm disappointed about our recent loss but they are still an awesome team The games as I mentioned are really really fun and the ticket costs are not to jacked up As far as Arizona goes The Phoenix Suns are definitely the best team in the state hands down.
Went here last night to take advantage of the Arizona Restaurant Week menu and Modern Steak still deserves five stars    Made a reservation through OpenTable and when we arrived we were seated promptly even though the restaurant was a packed house   The menu choices were excellent Three courses for $2900 and they also offered $3000 bottles of wine of which we chose a wonderful Shiraz  Everyone in our party chose the Filet Mignon as their entree seeing as how just the Filet alone on the normal dinner menu goes for $3500  They give you four choices of starters and entrees where most of the Restaurant Week menus only offer three choices   Also the items they offered on the Restaurant Week menu are actually on the dinner menu    They did not create a menu specifically for Restaurant Week   One of our party members stated "this is the best steak I have ever had"   Beautiful decor throughout the restaurant and bar and great outdoor patio too.
My home internet was recently down so in order to get online I packed up my laptop and headed to this coffee shop just down the street from my house Not being a coffee drinker I can only say that the hot chocolate was very good As others have mentioned the work space is great Fast internet connection large table in the center with power strips and individual tables with great power hookups all around the room I think I even recognized some fellow Yelpers.
We took our 11 year old American Eskimo/Border Collie mix to Hug N Pups for the first time yesterday and we were very impressed  Everyone in the shop was friendly attentive and kind  Our pup who tends to be shy with strangers was comfortable and clearly at ease when we picked him up  He was groomed beautifully and they clipped him exactly to our design  The shop was also very clean and welcoming and all of the other pets looked very content too  I would highly recommend Hug N Pups to anyone in need of grooming services for their four-legged babies  We have several dogs and have tried numerous salons over the years - these ladies are at the top of our list and our dogs'  We live several miles away but a good groomer can be so hard to find and this shop is well worth the drive  We will definitely be back.
Lots to do great for people watching huge sports stadium ample parking beautiful fountain.
I have a huge sweet tooth but being a baker myself I'm always very picky about the desserts I choose I have to say Woobie's Cookies are definitely high on my favorite cookie list The cookies are consistently soft and fluffy with some really cool flavors I tried their Caramel Brulee Woobiedoodle last Saturday for the first time and I was surprised at how yummy rich the flavor was My favorite though is still the Cocoa Ganache These ladies have NAILED the art of ganache which is not an easy feat It's also good to know they use quality organic ingredients which is a HUGE plus for me since not only is it better for you but it really makes a difference in the taste It's cool to know I can find some really good quality stuff from this unique small business right here in downtown Phoenix.
Started off being a favorite however the service has gone down hill fast  There are two male  workers named Daniel and Peter and are absolutely horrible One of them was so busy cruising the female customers and staring at their bodies and the other one was incredibly rude and condescending There are plenty of other restaurants around the area that provide much better service.
This is a very cute little place with delicious ice cream It is old fashioned but not as kitschy as Sugar Bowl I met the owner and the three young people that were working there they were all friendly and nice to my kids I usually always go for chocolate or mint chip but I tried their cinnamon and it was to-die-for My kids (who both happened to be dressed in Superman capes) had the Superman ice cream It was a pleasant experience The only thing I was disappointed with was there was no changing table of any sort in the restroom which is pretty much a must-have for a family-friendly establishment.
I have been to this store several times over the last few years Sami and his guys are the best  I expected all Sprint Stores to give the same sort of customer service that the guys at Queen Creek & Alma give  Boy was I mistaken  The corporate store at Chandler blvd & price freeway is the extreme oposite of how good the service is at Queen Creek & Alma School    I was "educated" on the difference between the 2 stores by 3 employees at the corporate store  They "corporate store" should be embarassed at the lack of customer service   I think that the lackluster employees at the corp store need to be "educated" by Sami and his staff of how to help a customer.
Definitely NOT Debra  She was not as helpful as I thought  Proofing was poor and though it took 3 times to get one of the cards redone several complained about the size of the font as the background of the invitation was dark  Spent a lot of money and should have been very satisfied  Several vendors were shown the invitation and agreed with me.
Food was ok waitress was a bitch and had us move after we say down to accommodate "regulars" Found employees to be in a rush food not up to par and just unaccomodating Never going back stunk.
Mojo in city center is great All fresh ingredients clean froyo machines and tasty yogurt 'nuff said.
I love Cartel The coffee is awesome and the employees are almost always friendly Do they have their bad days Sure but so does everyoneI've noticed that most of the people complaining or leaving negative (or less positive) reviews are doing so because of the clientele How immature Let's stick to reviewing the venue and the product not whether you like the patrons If some patron doesn't like a frappuccino and says so to the barista who really gives two flying pigs Everyone is entitled to their opinion My recommendation is to try to be a little less insecure and consider the impact your review will have on the actual business and the people that put their blood sweat and tears into it before you start taking away points because a certain part of society seeks out novelty and enjoys well made things Just my two cents.
Great toasted sandwich The owners are very nice And they have Miss Vickies Salt & Vinegar Chips They are so hard to find.
Well I debated writing my review for this place because it happened a few years ago but I still boycott it to this day so here goes I went here to meet some friends and bought a quesadilla Nothing special but still good I paid with my debit card and tipped the waiter $1 on the receipt I was given to sign After looking over my checking account a week or so later I discovered that my tip had magically gone from $1 to $700 Now ordinarily one would think there was a mistake in my handwriting however I had also totaled the amount on that same receipt for the cost of the food and the tip so there was no way my math was off by $600 I contacted the bar several times and gave them copies of my receipt that I signed and they did nothing about it They never returned my calls or offered to refund the money How big of a deal do you make over $600 I gave up but vowed to never return to this place again If you do go do NOT under any circumstance use a debit or credit card and if you do watch your bills like a hawk for unscrupulous accounting errors.
Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken Raisins Nuts Pineapple) which was made spicy the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that Finished up with sticky rice w/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea Get there while you can  Oh yeah and their music was killing it Tracy Chapman Shawn Colvin Men at Work some 90's shit.
There are stores here at which I never shop (eg Tiffany Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Burberry Louis Vuitton Prada) and those which make up a lot of what's in my closet (eg Ann Taylor LOFT H&M Charming Charlie Abercrombie & Fitch lucy Victoria's Secret etc) There's also Sephora Sunglass Hut and Coach Some restaurants include The Yard House (yum) and Grand Lux Cafe The food court has a Paradise Bakery Valet parking is available and there's a parking garage as well This is my favorite shopping spot in the Valley You can very easily stay here and lose your entire dayas well as the contents of your wallet.
Arranged for a "small" group of 22+ to meet for happy hour and great acoustic music  Not only did they graciously accommodate the group but the waitress Erin was able to give separate checks and constantly checked to see if everything was good and made sure that everyone was taken care of well  The food was great Something so simple as sliders were made to taste amazing with sauteed onions and pickles  The beer sampler was a huge hit and enjoyed by many in the group  This place knows how to make sure everyone leaves happy  The whole group was pleased and can't wait to go back  Thank you thank you thank you.
our  server kira was  awesome  great  vibe  awesome &  creative  foods  and  great  wines definitely  coming  back.
Wow My taste buds haven't been THIS excited in a long time The food was truly amazing the service so friendly and the ambiance very casual and relaxed Even as I type this the flavors of the yassa chiken and the goat curry still linger strongly in my gustatory memory My friend and fellow yelper John M and I also had the pleasure of having the lovely Chef Esther Mbaikambey come over to chat with us I know I will be coming back here very often and I look forward to their all-you-can-eat Sunday (noon to 4 pm) where you can choose as many as you want (3 to start order more if you've finished the 3) from pepper soup eguisi soup pof-pof fish and couscous yassa chicken curry chicken and jolof rice - all for $999 - soda included.
I've been going here for years Great drink prices and always something to do What it lacks in class it makes up in charm.
Waited 2 1/2 hours just for the doctor to fill out a prescription refill Thank god I'm generally a calm person Just know you'll be waiting at least 1hr till they call your name They'll schedule you at 2 or whatever but the doctor won't be available till 3.
Thanks to the tips from other Yelpers we rolled right up to the unmarked double doors Hidden next to a coffee bar is little gem of a restaurantand I mean little My boyfriend and I got there around 7 on a Saturday night and shared a large table with another group We loved the ambiance and their no nonsense attitude and the food does not disappoint We started with a bowl of posole then I got the sea bass special and he got the gumbo It would seem that everything on the menu is ridiculously fabulous We will definitely make this a regular spot for us.
This place is really amazing- the food & ambience  The butterfish melts in your mouth the lamb is tender with delicious spice and the Shishito Peppers are yummy  Something for everyone- you won't be disappointed.
Cherubini's is closing in a week  Is there no GodOne of the four horseman of good coffee shops is shutting down  Cherubini's you can operate out of my apartment for free  Just let me run it past my landlord.
Egg drop soup at ninety-nine places out of one hundred will be flavorless bland and boring usually requiring the addition of soy sauce in a last ditch effort to salvage some level of flavor out of it Not hereJade Palace IS that one in one hundred place A restaurant where the egg drop soup is such a brightly colored yellow It will remind you of the scene in Pulp Fiction where Samuel L Jackson opens the briefcase and whatever was in it presumably gold cast a golden hue onto his face Its that brightAnd the flavor Incomparable Rich with depth and flavor A rarity for egg drop The egg drop soup however was merely foreplay as compared to my entree Egg Foo YungMost EFY's are served patty-shaped or as a thin layer covering the plate Not here Here your EFY expectations will be overly exceeded when as you see it being delivered you're unable to recognize it as an EFY Mountainous it looks like a beautifully golden browned soufflé hot out of the oven You can't wait to sample it It's then you discover how its uncanny resemblance to a perky D-cup is the clever result of not one but several layers of spongy EFY goodness And to augment this delight (as if a D-cup would ever need augmentation) there's a gravy boat filled to its gunwales with a rich and flavorful brown sauce tying the dish together in a tightly woven knot A pleasant young server Egg Drop soup with a flavor so extraordinarily rare I can still taste it And a gigantic EFY mound that was definitely 'more than a mouthful' That's what i call the ultimate Chinese experience PSMy wife had the Chicken Chow Mein which I didn't sample until 3 o'clock this morning It was cold gelatinous and served in a box which in no way resembled a big golden breast A disappointment by any uber-male hetero / lesbianic account to say the least.
This is the mother of all Whole Foods- at least of the ones I've been too I understand that this location is fairly new and it shows in all of it's glorious aesthetically pleasing amazingnessThey have your WF standards-beautiful produce selection with a setup that makes you want to buy vegetables and fruits you don't even know how to cook and/or eat It has your salad bar olive bar deli mini pizzeria cheese shop smoothie bar-the gang's all here What makes it stand out is the actual bar inside of the market I know back up There's a bar in this WF Drinks snacks and if I'm not mistaken a nice view of the parking lot which is entertainment in itself because this WF shares a lot with Trader Joe's Nothing like the hordes of gluten-free vegan masses descending on the traditionally small lots of both stores and clashing like the Greek gods they think they are Instead of tritons and thunderbolts they use Priuses and recyclable bags full of tempehAnyway minus the sh-tshow parking lot this is a fantastic Whole Foods that I'm excited to go back to.
Great food Clean Top notch service People are always friendly and seem happy to be there.
Great food at good pricesExcellent service also.
We don't like to repeat restaurants on vacation but we visited this restaurant on our spring training vacation this year and last year Their small burgers are great size so u can have 2 and experience more flavors Sweet tots and smothered tots are great and we haven't found a bad sandwich Wild boar wagu chicken quinoa and the pb&j are all our favorites I cannot believe how delicious the pb&j is Highly recommend trying different burger types in one visit hereAll sides are a la cart and sandwiches are smaller but if you're looking for something unique and different this is a sure stop  Prices may be considered high but when you try the food it's understandable  Happy Hour is early if you want the cheaper prices.
Came here to test out food for our company celebration it was great We booked and then had a really good time Nice beer selection.
This place is just hands down exquisite White Salmon Start to finish I can't say a bad thing about this place The decor is impressive and the drinks awesome They have a $360000 Seafood Tower appetizer if you have that kinda cash I gotta say though if they ever offer it to you as a special "White Salmon"  Get it It was like candy Never had anything like it UNREAL Now I'm hungry.
This place is terrible  I went with a co-worker because we had gotten coupons  We only work 5 minutes away in good traffic so we decided to order on line that way we didn't have to take an extended lunch break I noted on my order online that I had a coupon for free chips as did my co-worker  They called her to tell her that her order would be cancelled because they cannot do coupons online  This is not noted anywhere online  I was not called and was charged for everything  I didn't have the option to leave the chips on or take them off  There is absolutely no parking anywhere close to this establishment  We ended up parking down the street and walking 2 blocks to get there When we got there our sandwiches were ready right away which was great  The guy running the register forgot our drinks/chips and had to be reminded by someone else before we left  Their fountain drink area was dirty and had tea spilled all over the place  When I went to get a lid the entire lid holder fell over We were still willing to give the benefit of the doubt - until we took our first bite  This sandwich was one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had  I got the turkey sandwich and it tasted old and like tuna  I couldn't even stomach more than 2 bites  $10 thrown in the trash over this  I will never go back here.
I love Frasher's The service has been awesome both times that I went I sat at the bar and Jen served me She's attentive and friendly and knows her stuffThere was a male manager last time we were there which would be last Saturday night He was also exceptionally nice and helpfulThe crab stuffed mushrooms ribs mashed potatoes and corn are all to die for The appearance is fun It's got a divey atmosphere with exceptional food Not to mention I looove drinking wine in dim lighting I love this place.
I used YELP to find a Mexican place with a good rating when we were in town THANKS Yelpers This place is awesome  Really cool gun place next door too.
I continue to go to this location because its the closest to my home however today is my last day there There is an employee who is so RUDE (she refused to give me her name) I asked her for a marker and she said she didn't have one She's always on the very far left SHE'S SUCH A B***** So then I said "it's a post office and you don't have a marker" So then I asked the sweet looking employee next to her for a marker and she was happy to lend it to me So then I come back to other this rude employee and told her "you really couldn't just ask someone for a marker" "How hard was that"  I asked to speak to a manager and want to know what the manager said to me She said "do not disrespect my employee" OMG Anyway before with the white lady on the very very far left she has short hair She's such a bitch.
With the attitude that the staff has with their customers I'm not sure how they've been in business this long Their food is good but the times that I have gone there the customer service is pretty horrible to say the least The kid that runs the pick up counter not once not twice but every singe time throws the receipt at me No thank you no smile no nothing Horrible service from the entire staff.
Hey - All the local construction guys eat here - so you he has good quality stuff at low pricesNice assortment of different Hot dogs.
Order in drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme)  They "get" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive throughI haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce tomato onion fanOnly gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else  Same with the fries salt is all you need.
I use to work here about 5 years ago and now I am embarrassed to have said that  We went to eat there during the week and there wasn't hardly anybody there  We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were horrible  I ate the Pasta Milano and it is usually great especially when I worked there  Now this crap is garbage  My wife had some rigatoni stuff and it was terrible  I asked the server what the hell is going on  He said that the people that own Planet Hollywood had bought the Macaroni Grill brand from Brinker International  They don't even wear ties anymore and they wear jeans They don't have a store manager there anymore This one is garbage and their food sucks If you don't believe me then go there yourself  Food use to be so much better years ago.
Great quick mexican food Had ground beef burrito and the ground beef is cooked to order which usually pre-cooked awesome.
Best fast food restaurant  Great service  Fresh food  Love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce  The fries are great when they are hot  Fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon  Mmmm I could eat here everyday.
I went to Gallo Blanco for lunch durinig a meeting LOVED IT We walked from Central and Clarendon it wasn't bad just down Clarendon and you won't miss it The food AMAZING I got a Carne torta and the special of the day was a 1/2 torta and a salad YUMMY We also got Chips and Guac So So good I can't wait to take my dad there tonight :-).
Ever since the Pasta Bar closed down i have been on the search for a local Italian joint with a very welcoming menu and Cuoco Pazzo deliveredThe menu is unpretentious  The service is very friendly  The owner comes out to check on his guest and strikes a conversation What keeps me REALLY coming back is that the food has great flavor and doesn't even try  I've been to restaurants where you taste the food and its like they are trying very hard to make it taste amazing   At Cuoco Pazzo it comes together very nicelyDefinitely a must go.
This place is awesome Dr Kessler and his staff do a phenomenal job I just found this place recently and will continue to make the drive to Scottsdale for all my eye care needs My only gripe is that the selection of frames is on the short end but I still found something I liked.
Small lite cafe in a strip mall put the decor aside and go in and enjoy the wonderful food and generous portions  Eggs Benedict is the house specialty  Good old school breakfast that also is open for lunch.
This is by far the best tanning salon I have ever been a member ofThe staff is friendly and helpful and their salon is beautiful and totally customer oriented  They REALLY don't skip out on anything with their customersYou'll be happy to find some Hempz lotion in the bathroom for your convenience to use after you tan - complimentaryThey're prices are incredibly reasonable and they don't try to screw you over like a lot of tanning places do  I have nothing but great things to say about this place  I moved from Chandler 2 years ago and have been to 4 other salons in Tempe and now Los Angeles where I live and never have any of them met the same standards I experienced hereVery very sad to have left.
Defining things in the negative is dangerous but in this case a little negative-definition is necessary: TMI isn't a fake dive bar frequented by white kids pretending to be poor it isn't a fake (insert European nationality here) pub it isn't trying to serve over-priced small plates it doesn't have super sexy low lighting or uncomfortable chairsIt is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste goodThe sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it baked and crusty and rich  The salads are simple and deliciousHappy hour is really generous - $250 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix excepting the Roosevelt which is very un-hang-outable  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines and the wine selection is really great as wellBest of all kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.
I tried Torched Goodness yesterday at Techiepalooza at Skysong in Scottsdale I bought the vanilla and the sea salt caramelThe good: Eric was polite the portion size was reasonable and the price was affordableThe really good: The creme brulee was delicious The top was caramelized and crunchy the custard had a lovely texture and an equally lovely flavorI hope to track down the truck around Thanksgiving and try the pumpkin flavor If it's anything as good as the vanilla I'm in for a treat.
We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice didn't say anything except "this is  (didn't catch name)  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizzaSince it's my wife and I that were home both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it outGrantedthey did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering.
Excellent food excellent service and a very short walk from the light rail make this a perfect place for dinner  It's a small place so larger groups may have to wait a little longer than a traditional restaurant but the food is worth it and the wait staff is excellent.
I'm not one to usually complain but I was extremely dissatisfied with this location Got ripped off BIG TIME Make sure you listen VERY carefully and ask as many questions as possible I can't wait to get rid of sprint because of this If you go in make sure you do not get Brian Nice guy but He's a scam artist only interested in getting a sale not worried about your situation .
Food was not good Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too.
This should be your only stop when in downtown phoenix for drinks and food Before or after a D-Backs or Suns game or any other event Great drinks live DJ playing music in the background all around fun place from the elevator shaft to the restrooms I recommend any pizza.
I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here but all my regrets are definitely gone Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stayTaking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant Akin to something like Five Guys you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter They even have a separate counter for serving desserts The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me the Italian beef attracts the most customers The gravy is excellent and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves The bread does the sandwich justice but it's good but not great I personally like the combo which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beefThe sides are not something to shirk at either The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz To top everything off this entire restaurant even has a drive thru which totally worksThe menu is huge so I'm far from exhausting my limit here I hear the salads are pretty good and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually However it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.
This was my first time dining here and I'm impressed I'm a concierge which means I dine out a lot as part of my job so I'm a bit of a guest/customer service snob so I'm not easily impressed The location was great and easy to get to The atmosphere was nice Not too dark of lighting which is good I like to be able to read the menu and see what I'm eating/drinking I would have liked maybe a different color scheme and more Italian art but that played no impact on my review Timoteo was our server He was extremely knowledgeable kind friendly and quick without making us feel rushed That's important Too many servers/waiters these days come off as annoyed by questions wanting you to hurry up and tip them But not here We felt so welcomed and comfortablelike we were with family In the same respect the service was not intrusive either A perfect balance The food was delicious Homemade bread to start was wonderful Meat was perfectly cooked to order Kudos to the kitchen staff We loved how well Timoteo was able to make suggestions based on my indecisiveness I just told him what I was in the mood for and he said they could even combine the Filet and Penne with the Bolognese from a different dish When it came time for dessert he was fabulous once again with pairing our Tawny Porto with Tiramisu and Moscato with Lemon SorbetThank you Zoran for a wonderful restaurant and to Timoteo for a wonderful experience We will be back again.
I can't remember eating better carne asada or even a better bean burrito this side of the border Wash it down with a Mexican Coke and it's heaven Notes: Interior is very small maybe 5 tables total (but there's a patio) Service was very quick and friendly Parking is easy and free.
What started as a single smoothie (post Insanity workout) has turned into a full blown Mojo Bowl addiction From the first time I tried the banana bread smoothie Mojo Bowl is pretty much a daily craving I love the story behind Mojo Bowl and it's creator Scott His passion for healthy and delicious food is apparent with every hand created acai bowl Just watching him prepare my Xena bow was like watching a piece of art being created I can't tell you what is the best smoothie bowl or salad to try because they are all amazing in their own way True story Stop by the yellow food truck at the Phoenix Public Market and say hi to Scott You will leave with a craving for health for life.
This place is legitIf you are having a craving for a delicious burger you should check it out for sure All sort of interesting burgers and specialsI imagine they are busy for lunch but it has never been crowded for dinnerTry the sweet potato tots Super good.
Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco So when I heard that there was a Burmese place here in the valley well I got excitedThe place is awesome Crossed somewhere between Asian style and Indian style we were all very surprised on how well the food is prepared We ordered about 13 dishes with our friend (plenty of leftovers) ranging from coconut rice to beef short rib curry The flavors were great and very unexpected in terms of simple preparation of high quality ingredients Standouts were the ginger salad (mixed table side) pork belly curry and the coconut rice Not only was everything just incredibly tasty but also well priced Add another tasty mom and pop owned restaurant to the valley its a real winner.
If you live in AZ or just visiting you have to go to the House of TricksIn an old house surrounded by  lots of trees and  is in a house and has an amazing patio and bar outside Food is amazing and service is great This is a great restaurant for a date or a special occasion The setting is amazing  and so wonderful I have recommended this place already to numberous people I will definitley go back.
Yep One of the best dollar trees in the Phoenix Metro area I have been to the Dollar Tree in Chandler on Via Linda in Scottsdale the one by PV mall and another one in Hancock Plaza in PV/Phoenix This Dollar Tree is by far the cleanest most organized and well kept store The staff is very helpful and friendly and I have never ever had a problem with this location They also seem to have the items I need in stock Their food items are the freshest too.
So I was expecting a lot when I walked in the door here and sadly I have to say that it failed to meet those expectations This place seems on the outside to be a top notch pizza place that makes it's pizza in a coal brick oven like some of the best joints out there However the truth soon becomes apparent once you order your pizza and then wait forever The waitress was very nice and I felt bad for her because the kitchen was quite frankly letting her down big time when it came to getting things out of the oven The pizza took around an hour to get after ordering yes an hour for a coal fired pizza The pizza comes and smells okay but doesn't knock your socks off aroma wise and taste wise was really bland Even the crust which was the best part of it was very bland it lacked flavor The other issue was a lack of toppings and sauce The sauce was missing something and was only lightly dabbled in spots on the pizza and for supposedly real cheese (what little was on it) it was tasteless Being a lover of pizza I was highly saddened by this place that seemed to have soo much potential Pricewise you expect more for what you are paying and everyone in my group was very depressed with the quality I don't however think the place is beyond redemption and if they would make some changes to add some real flavor they could have a nice place here However I won't be going back anytime soon unless I hear they have made some changes I think the only reason this place has been able to make so far is because of its location at the San Tan Marketplace and not really on the merits of its food You end up really wanting to like the place but it just doesn't happenI would suggest if you want a good pizza for around the same price point check out  Venezia Pizza.
A family owned GEM of a restaurant  Worth the drive to Wickenburg   Based upon some other reviews I got the Taco Salad and was not disappointed  Everyone in our party was well taken care of and all of the recipes were amazing  Portion sizes were beyond fair and nobody went home hungry  Services was perfect they clearly know how to run a restaurant.
As  new transplant to Phoenix I was so happy to find this place on groupon  After the stress of flying from NYC 8 months pregnant and with our cat having dinner here was like a dream  Everything was delicious portions were filling and it was just so relaxing  We had the duck special and the salmon along with snails and the goat cheese toast triangles- everything was made just right   We had a great time  Also everyone was very nice  This place would fit right in in Brooklyn or Paris  Glad it is in Phoenix.
This one of the best Fry's Marketplace in the East Valley  They recently completed their remodel and it turned out beautiful  If you shop in Gilbert this has the best prices and values.
I work for the same company as the first reviewer and this week it was my department's turn to volunteering at St Mary's This was actually my third time volunteering for the organization as it is an annual event for my team In prior years I haven't been into volunteering because I was basically an ass and didn't see the benefit in it for me Personally the past six months have seen some really good highs as well as some very bad lows but I met people who helped change my perspective on helping people and giving back to the community  And even though it should be a year-round thought and not only be about this time of year the need is more visible during the holidays Knowing that people are struggling and seeing the good this organization does for people really does make a difference With my family back East and just me here in Arizona I don't participate in the holidays but spending time volunteering or supporting local charities is a great way to give to those who are in need and I have discovered the good feeling it bringsThe first reviewer provided good quantitative data on the number of hungry children and adults living in the country today With 3 grandparents still living I am sensitive to the needs of our seniors and the struggles they face with heating bills and medication taking money away from food expenditures Another thing that impressed me with St Mary's is that it was the country's first food bank founded back in 1967A difference this year in comparison to my first experience with St Mary's is the impact the economic downturn has had on families Due to increased unemployment cutbacks in jobs rising bills and other concerns many more people are facing hunger this year than ever before That puts extra pressure on organizations such as St Mary's to meet the demand and that is accomplished in part to volunteers such as you and me We were told that last year they served more than 65 million pounds of food - enough for 300000 meals per day - do Arizonans alone With unemployment continuing to increase that number is sure to be higher this year The volunteer staff member told us that the emergency bags they assemble which is for people who just lost a job or are in immediate need and not yet in the system have seen an increase of 400% this yearMy group today totaled about 60 people and we filled boxes for 2 hours When you volunteer the cool thing is the volunteer staff member will total how much food the group assembled and how many people it helped With our work today she said we bagged 6800 lbs of potatoes 2230 of the emergency food bags (which she said would be gone by this evening) and 15200 lbs of prepared food boxes (550 boxes on 22 palettes) All total for the day the grand total with prepared boxes and food bags she said would be enough to feed 35200 people Granted we had a big group but for just 2 hours of help that is a big difference The sad thing is with the number of people coming in for assistance that food will be gone in a couple of daysI would encourage everyone to take some time out of the schedule and help out A little bit does go a long way and those recipients greatly appreciate what they receive.
i am afraid that my first "review" did not adequately express my affinity for zoyo and its manager michael  it is by far my favorite yogurt place in the valley  my only problem with it is that it's in ahwatukee and i live in glendale  PLEASE open a zoyo in the west valley  we like yogurt too  :).
This place is awesome The tea is way better than Starbucks and the coffee doesn't taste burnt The manager Debbie is almost always there and is always very friendly and accommodating I recommend the southern iced tea It tastes like rose pedals with just a very slight sweetness.
You Have to try this place it simply amazing You won't get hard chunks of  ice like most snowballs These snowballs are powder soft and bursting with flavor Sweet cold and refreshing Jeff the owner is a super nice guy who is determined to find a flavor you will love There are 53 flavors to choose from and I plan on making my way through the list.
As someone who loves sushi rice but not the raw fish that usually accompanies it this place is perfect When we came in the manager described it as the Chipotle of sushi and with the affordable prices of PeiWei While I thought it was kind of strange to describe this place in terms of nearby restaurants it really is an accurate description  The rolls are a decent size and quite filling I'm a big guy but two rolls filled me up easily  I got a brown rice mango cucumber and asparagus roll and a white rice avocado spinach and tofu skin roll Both were delicious and only $4 each for 10 pieces  This place is my new favorite place in all of Phoenix Can't wait to go back.
My wife and I ate at Taste of China once a week before we moved away from the area and we've had trouble finding a new Chinese place we like as much  The Honey Seared Chicken is very good in particular and the prices for everything are very reasonable considering the quality of the food  Highly recommended.
Last week I had my first appointment with Simply Dentistry Doctor Tran and her dental hygienist were both really nice Dr Tran gave me my cleaning and it was very thorough I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays The office itself looks and feels like a spa The plastic used to make the toothbrush that hey hand out is recycled from yogurt cups and when I'm done with it I can send it in to be recycled again They also commented on how they are almost entirely paperless and do their best to make "green" choices Needless to say this is not your typical dentist office and I like it.
Great service.
Just got back from Kiku SushiYUMM How much fun is a revolving sushi buffet We loved it We ate until we were stuffed along with two giant beers for $40 The sushi was fantastic The egg roll was cold but I just told them and they took it right away The cucumber salad was cold tasty and a great palette cleanser Our waitress JoJo was eager to get us to try her favorites and you can tell she is proud of the food they serve The whole staff greeted everyone as they entered Really great vibe reasonable prices delicious food revolving around the room and cold beerthis is my idea of a good time.
To put it simply this place is amazing  I went in for the very first time today for happy hour after work  The front door was opened for me and I was promptly greeted and sat at a table with some co-workers  The waitress was very nice and efficient  The food oh wow that burger was fantastic and the double truffle fries were to die for We also shared some zucchini fries and sweet potato fries both were equally amazing  The prices were even excellent especially for the posh location I cannot wait to come back and eat again.
If your over 55 and enjoy overpriced "Happy Hour" food then this is your place It is also cramped and crowded at the bar and I spotted a good number of those fruit fleas swirling around the bar area Place caters to the well heeled and sweater wearing crowd and although it was Monday Night football no volume was on the small TV and nobody but me was really interested in the game The least expensive food for HH is 6 bucks and that is bowl of soup Other dishes that came out looked like the ole tiny portions at HH prices swaperoo I tried their famous Huckleberry margarita and although not bad it came out of a machine and a swirl of huckleberry or something similar was put on top of drink Nothing here at this place warrants a return viisit and they should work on that fruit fly problem beacuse that is a major issue swatting them away sitting at the bar.
Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated.
I've been going to Spring Training games here for close to ten years now and this place is really the closest you can get to a Wrigley experience in the southwest - part sports bar part stadium all fun Make sure you get an Old Style from Mark the Beer Guy (he can usually be found around home plate on the mezzanine) As a rule I avoid the concession stand hot dogs in favor of a Vienna Beef cart serving up Chicago style dogs but we've all had those before So if you're feeling adventurous try the pork tenderloin sandwiches from the trailer behind the left field bleachers Not good for you but good Ridiculously good Perfectly breaded and deep fried A true testament to the greatness that is Iowan porkOh yeah and there's some baseball being played too.
I love this bar It's cozy and because it's small it is an awesome place to meet other people in the neighborhood A great place to go when you just want to feel "home".
Awesome Mexican foodChilaquiles shrimp ceviche tortas and all of the tacos were delicious Oh and their tomatillo salsa was awesomeI didn't care for their horchata it lack flavor.
Great service at this store Ask for Ryan He's the best.
Libraries are a wonderful thing now if folks would just learn how to pronounce the word library -{)This library has such a good variety of books recorded too The video library is fairly good too I also love the option of ordering a book to be ready for you when you arrive The folks working there are consistently helpfulThe building it self normally would not catch my eye as I am not particularly drawn to the modern aesthetic Yet I find myself looking at the corners of the interior and its structure it is actually pretty coolThe parking too is quite easyWe are lucky to have such a place where cheap folk such as I can get a good book to read.
I've been a member at another local gym that also has "Fitness" in their name and they are nothing like Competitive Fitness I have never been to a gym that really challenged me like this one does The trainers actually care about your progress and work with you to modify daily workouts to fit your abilities So you never have to feel like you can't do something In fact they'll help you have the confidence that you can The gym has a WOD or "Workout of the Day" which everyone participates in There is always a trainer around to help answer any questions and motivate you Members are very friendly and supportive of each other I would recommend this gym for everyone.
Never GO HERE EVER First they robbed me of 150 dollars for a straight year until one day I decided to call after finding the receipt of the shoes I returned in an old bag even after everything my "check" got lost in the mail  and never got sent So I had to go out of my way to pick up my money that was suppose to be returned to me one year ago.
Ohhh Hula's I've been here on one occasion so far and I can't wait to go back We went there on a Saturday night before heading out to our favorite club Sanctum which is really close There was no wait we were seated promptly and our very nice server got us our drinks right away The decor and ambiance was lovely- 50s tiki theme good music and low key peopleI really appreciate places with great fresh salads and tasty cocktails and Hula's delivered I order the spicy caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a Mai Tai It was SO GOOD The salad was a huge portion the ingredients were fresh and the shrimp was grilled to perfection The Mai Tai was great as well and it wasn't a typical girly Mai Tai It was strong and I had a great buzz going after drinking itOn Saturday nights we usually like to chill at the restaurant for a couple hours before heading out to the club where the music is really loud and we can't talk Hula's had no problem with this and we were able to sit there for a while and chat without being bothered to leaveI'm really surprised at the mediocre reviews this place has gotten because I had a great meal and was highly satisfied :).
About three weeks back Chicken salad 3 pieces with uncooked areas  The rest is kinda detail The Main office got back to us re the tweeted picture of raw chickenthe local one didn't even address it Looked up their ratings re health and safety and it appears to be a more institutional problem  than this oversight.
This is the pizza that California Pizza Kitchen wishes it could be like:  Organic natural and free-range products that are fresh flavorful and are balanced perfectly with the other ingredients on your pizza  The crust is just right-perfectly crispy  I tried a Margherita pizza and the chicken artichoke  The chicken artichoke was delicious with lots of toppings huge chunks of artichoke and very flavorful chicken  Since they use free-range chicken you can definitely tell the difference in taste vs a regular mass-farmed chicken  Service was excellent as well  Despite being very busy our drinks were constantly attended to and refilled as needed  I will definitely be going here again for more pizza and to try out some wingsPS  If you get an appetizer I highly recommend the brie and roasted garlic plate  So delicious.
We got therethere was a waitit was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth itFrom the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouthWe are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican fooda delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest daysI tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotleyou get the picture)We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu guaranteeing we'll be back for moreAny complaints Only the smallest of oneI actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke) I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to -) and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfillLa Condesa is what a good taqueria should be just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua.
This is our go to delivery pizza They always say it will take 45 minutes but they are here in 30 and sometimes under We live very close but other places haven't delivered as fast as these guysWe usually end up ordering on Sundays when we are to lazy to cook and we always order the same thing They are nothing but consistent and good from the pizza to the wings I have had other pizza around the valley but none this goodjust genuinely good pizza and service (and ranch dressing).
Somebody stop me I can't walk by without feeling the urge You can fill up the bowl with as much as you want and pay by the weight A brilliant system Be sure to check them out on Facebook for coupons and codes.
My husband & I went there on a Saturday night after I left a bridal shower we were in town for  I picked up my hubby @ the hoteI for a little bit of a romantic date & found Fleming's on YELP  We arrived about 9pm & sat at the bar  WHAT A DELIGHT  They have an amazing wine list on ipads for you to peruse  Very informative & includes numerous pairing possibilities for every item on the list  The small plates are perfect for a late night bite & more than enough for me as an entree' We paired the dessert with the reccommended port & all I can say is it was heavenly  Our server was absolutely fantastic  Attentive & personable  Such an enjoyable evening we can't wait to go there again.
One of the best places to get real home cooked deli food Meatballs Roast Beef Chicken Salad Baked Beans And a host of other delicious food All home cooked prepared and served by the wonderful and friendly Casella family.
New favorite sushi spot Staff was friendly sushi was amazing and fresh I loved the fresh wasabi All day everyday happy hour is the best can't beat the prices Will be back.
5 Stars all the way If you are looking for a new place for breakfast and want to try something different the breakfast club is the place to go  Great service great location great menu and great atmosphere  Also has a great patio to eat outside.
I hate to do this because I don't want this place to be busy for selfish reasons however I have an obligation to uphold It is of no surprise that Vovomeena is anything but fantastic coming from the flavor dense minds from Tuck Shop and Astor HouseThis morning I got their signature Japanese iced coffee and the Espanola which was kind of an egg potato spinach and cheese pie with a chunky red sauce that is bursting with flavorsThe decor is sustainable and hip chairs were comfortable lighting is good staff is friendly and personable as well Can you tell I like the place.
Wonderful modern Mexican food  We had the guacamole with pomegranate seeds and it was amazing  The pork was also incredible -- slow cooked so it literally melted off the bone and needed no knife  Service was a little slow but I think that's because the place was packed  I am a patient person so I didn't really mind  The food was out of this world so I can't imagine fussing about the wait staffI would definitely go again and would bring more friends next time.
What do I dream about when I'm back in NYC I'll tell you: the supremely delicious banh khot that's made to perfection at Little Saigon I've never had anything like it in my life and I only wish I didn't have to wait for summer vacation to enjoy it againI've loved this Little Saigon for years: it's a charming place the people are fantastic and yes there are many other things on the menu that are superb But the banh knot has captured my heart.
This was recommended by my friend Kristin - who is an overall pet lover who has the happiest pets that I know ofso naturally I had to check it outThey have a great selection of everything overall and of course for an pet boutique - the latest in all of the hot trends for pets What I enjoyed is that they carry some specialty brands of shampoo that are organic and great for sensitive skin They were very helpful in pointing out so many things to me since I was a new pet owner and needed some attention and remedial dialogueOf Max was in heaven at this shop - all of the doggie treats and goodies are at eyeball level - so he ate hi way through the store and will never forget it.
Its been years since Ive been to an Outback and I was so pleasantly surprised how wonderful everything was this evening My boyfriend and I both got the 4 courses for $15 which is a screaming deal for the amount of food you get The french onion soup was a $1 up charge but totally worth it We asked for our steaks medium rare unaware of how thick an outback special would be They came more rare than medium rare so I did what I absolutely hate to do I sent it back Our server Christopher was so nice about it and seemed more interested in making sure we were actually enjoying our evening The manager stopped by to apologize (even though it was no one's fault but my own) and told me the steaks would be up in a minute or two We were so full so Christopher boxed up our desserts for us to go ALSO I ordered the skinny rita which was also amazing very light and refreshing perfect to start before a 4 course dinner We will be back because of the food management and our awesome server Chris.
We're renting a house for vacation in the Queen Creek area and decided to try the good here at Serranos The three of us were throughly impressed with the decor-- seeing as most Mexican restaurants have too vibrant and cheesy displays-- Serranos had calm-tones with a nice interior with the only thing vibrant being their plates The wait staff were ALL friendly whether or not they were serving us specifically Our waiter was extremely helpful with a good sense of humor and knew the menu wellThe margarita mix was to DIE FOR and definitely was the perfect pairing with our dinner The steak and chicken fajitas I had were not greasy whatsoever and even tasted healthy and delectable with perfect portioning.
Terrible flight Unaccompanied kids crawling on me spilling drinks throwing games Contacted US Airways repeatedly wouldn't offer _any_ material compensation whatsoever for 45h of discomfort Their official policy is that if you get from point A to point B they don't care what happens in between Avoid awful.
Love this place so clean so friendly great place for waxing and nails.
Very nice staff and this place is very clean The veterinarians are honest and reliable.
Wow Yeah I said wow This was some really good Chinese food It is payday and my coworkers wanted to go out to lunch One of them was craving Chinese food So Yelp to the rescue We found this place and my coworker realized she used to go here all the time and said it was good So off we wentIt is close to work so that is good The prices weren't bad so that is good Decor was nice a little dark inside but still good The tables had tablecloths with Chinese Zodiac place mats on them with a sheet of glass or plexiglass covering all of it Everyone was checking their signs and their families signs and joking around about it A nice distraction while waiting for our order Service was great They had no problem doing multiple checks and the food came out pretty quick So did the drinks The wait staff which I think were the owners were very attentive Drinks always refilled and asking us if we worked in the area and where we worked Also asked us if we had been there before When we said no they brought us over take out menusNow to the food It was so good Best Chinese food I have had in awhile I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan The white sauce that was on it was amazing The chicken and veggies were perfect and the fried rice was really good Everybody raved about their different meals Not one complaint They got us in and out with plenty of time to get back to work That was even with 5 people in our groupI will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu So far away from that other Panda it isn't even worth mentioning Even cheaper then them too Great find High five coworker.
This is just simple solid delish food One good way to tell a great lunchtime sandwich place is if the parking lot has cop and fire vehicles in it (This place is actually right across from a fire station so those guys have it easy) It's not uncommon to also see several UPS trucks plumbers trades folks and all other walks of life The product is so loaded up and fat that it's almost hard to eat This is a good problem to have Easily the best sandwich place in the Tukes and the greater I-10 n Ray part of the valley for that matter Nondescript yet comfortable semi hidden little suite next to a trophy and insurance business The menu features 24 sandwich combos on their signature soft chewy rolls They serve mostly just Sammy's but chili is great too  Sorry I rushed this review but no matter If you're in the area and hungry for a sandwich just head over I doubt you'll be disappointed.
Me and my girl went here last night for dinner and I had heard good things but was not sure what I was in for To my surprise when i stepped in through the large copper doors I was amazed This is a very nice place to eat It challenges any top tier steakhouse in the phoenix area and in my opinion beats them The reason is the value of the menu You get great cornbread and biscuits a relish plate soup or salad and a side of your choice included in the price Mastros Mortons and all the other greats are ala carte and here its all included and honestly i felt like i got a better steak I went with the prime rib dubbed "best of the west" and they were right It was one of if not the best I ever had My sweetheat had the combo oscar which had a small peice of salmon and a filet Everything was cooked to perfection the oscar sauce was deliciousso were the soups and salads Service was over the top and even though it was my first time there i felt like a regular Would I go backyou better believe it This place seemed to attract an older crowd but it was very nice and classyI can't understand why it  was not more crowed than it was After eating there i feel obligated to spread the word This is the best steakhouse in Phoenix Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised  Eat up and enjoy.
Owners are amazing All of their staff is friendly and very helpful They offer High-Quality products that do NOT fall apart after the first washing Very hip clothing that the owners hand pick Impressive Expensive Yes but quality usually is Thanks 42 Saint keep up the good work.
Every time I drive by this building I look to see my car in the third story windows Architects are coolMalarkey says visiting Arizonans encouraged him to open a branch here Putting the daily operations into the hands of chef Steven "Chops" Smith 37 who seems to have worked in every local kitchen including Different Pointe of View Olive & Ivy Noca Furio Luc's and St FrancisCooking style is divided into categories as Bites Smalls Greens Ocean Ranch and Farm Having visited the San Diego "Gas Lamp" store I was also impressed at the Scottsdale location which reminds me of an awesome bachelor padLooks like from what I remember Searsucker Scottsdale pretty much duplicated the menu and design of the Diego mother ship But after a while I would expect Smith to put his own stamp on the menuIn California I learned to enjoy stout from a beer knowledgeable gal at the tap room So I see Karl Strauss Imperial Stout on the menu and since I have been to Karl's I go for it It pours black Coffee dominates with some cocoa and roasted malts Taste is very smooth $12 for the bomber a 22 ozFrom the ranch I order the hanger "butcher's steak" with watercress bbq and blue fondue  $26 One of my favorite meals.
I'm amazed at how friendly everyone here at Liberty Market is Everytime I come here the staff are all so happy and friendly The Liberty Potatoes are the BEST potatoes I've ever tasted The quesadilla is amazing also.
This might be okay for young 20-somethings out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds intent on dinner conversation If you're satisfied to eat @ one of the bar tables you're set but if you're looking for old fashioned floor level seating good luck  After a 2 hour wait (and our party had actually arrived before we joined them) we two stepped over to a restaurant where we could actually sit down  And where we could hear each other w/o having to fight some blaring obnoxious pop musicCan't comment on the food because we never got any  Happy hour beers WERE cheap but $19 for two Happy Hour Absolut and Red Bulls is highway robbery if you ask me Server was nice enough  Mildly entertaining watching wasted floozies get flung from the mechanical bull  Could have done w/o the bloody boxing match on TVWheelchair accessible but only if you can get one of those aforementioned elusive tables otherwise you'll be at the perfect height to rest your head on the table while everyone towers above youPretty sure I'm never going back here  Not really my scene  Perfect if you want to rev up your man date w/ your bull riding skills before some hot drunken anonymous weekend sex though.
They are great every bit of advice makes total sense and if you just take time to practice their simple techniques you and your dogs lives will be much easier and more fulfilling I have seen a huge shift in my dog's behavior since taking her to their basic manners class It is well worth the money.
I fell in love with Chopstick's about a year ago The food is awesome and the staff is wonderful too They are very friendly clean and well priced Plus they don't use MSG and they have an entire vegetarian menu including tofu options awesome.
This place is amazing how have I not been in the entire 6+ years I have lived in the valley This place is very warm and inviting a sharp contrast to the nearby Mill District I went there earlier this week to have dinner with a friend House of Tricks has a great ambiance It's definitely a "date-night" sort of place We sat outside on the patio I ordered a Manhatten Iced Tea which ended up not being my cup of tea (no pun intended) but it was a well made drink For an appetizer we ordered the Artisan Cheese & Fruit plate Delicious Fruit and cheese plates always make me feel fancy The presentation was greatit was like a work of art For the main entree I had the Sugar-Spiced Salmon with Chinese Long Beans Mustard Sauce Sweet Soy-Ponzu Sticky Rice and Nori The salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had It was perfectly seasoned and cooked impeccably The rest of the dish was just as goodoh that sauce It was sweet with just the right amount of spiceOne drawback I have noticed-Thankfully I am now a pescitarian because the vegetarian options are quite limited I'd suggest checking out the website before going :)From the looks of the other reviews I see that the menu is seasonal so I look forward to coming back and trying what else this place has to offer.
This is by far the worst shellac manicure/ pedicure I have ever gotten I think a five year old could have done better I left with paint all over my cuticles lumpy shellac and my nails were uneven Do not go here.
Carlos is the man  He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience  5 and Diner is a great choice for families  The fifties themed decor is fun for all  On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old  Since a demonstration was out of the question I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided however and her folks enjoyed the $275 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast  The menu also features a separate section for seniors  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them  A note about prices  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $179) and can drive up your total cost  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent dinersThe Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste  The pancakes were uniform and served hot In all honesty however it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant five stars in this review Menu offerings are solid with a few amusing names scattered throughout but are for the most part predictable and basic  But come to think about it isn't that what you want from a fifties dinerEven though 5 and Diner is not a "genuine" fifties diner instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era it seems genuine enough  I've noticed that several locations have closed in recent years but the PV location seems to be unaffected and thriving.
I eat here weekly  At this pace I will be as big as five guysBut I can't help it  Big juicy burger double stacked topped just the way I like it and served with enough cajun fries for three guys this place makes the food I like  It's a man meal fit for a trucker   It'd take five guys just to keep me out of this joint.
This local hole-in-the-wall is the best Thai restaurant in Avondale (well ok it's the only one) It easy to miss but once you find it you won't forget it The menu is a bit beyond the standard Thai eatery offering bold authentic Thai flavors If you love Thai food this is the place to go If you don't get Thai food this is the place to go For the spicy dishes they can make it as Thai as you would like or it The service is very good and the owner and staff make you feel very welcome You owe yourself a short trip to this humble great restaurant.
DINERS BEWARE Came here for dinner tonight(Sunday night-July 7) It's my first time here the scenery is beautiful the menu looks great and I ordered Macadamia Crusted White Sea Bass When it came out I took a bite and thought the texture was a little strange and turned out to be chicken breast The waitress is nice took it back to get me the correct order It's taking a while so everybody at my table gave me food By the time it came out I just asked for it to go We got home I'm excited to take a bite of my sea bass and what do u know it's CHICKEN AGAIN So u know who's making money on that deal serving chicken for sea bass Oh if u want sea bass try ordering the chicken I can't believe they have a chef that doesn't know the difference between fish and chicken.
Best place to go meet friends for happy hour just get there early so you can grab a seat outside they fill up fast.
We tried Biscuits on Gilbert Road near Sam's Club about a month ago We are still in shock from the food (How do you screw up biscuits and gravy) The potatoes were ok The biscuits gravy and eggs all had a very strange taste similar to the smell of a cafeteria while cleaning almost like old dishwater We just drove by on our way from Sam's Club and their parking lot was quite full Hopefully we just hit a day they gave bad news to the cook otherwise most of these cars were first timersNeedless to say we most probably will not try it again there are too many very good breakfast places around.
My husband and I tried this place a week or two ago and LOVED IT Everyone was nice and it was busier than we thought Didn't take long to get our food AHHH ITS SO GOOD.
Ever wondered what it's like to visit the Secret Garden I imagine the atmosphere would sort of be like the patio at Cafe Monarch Head past the intimate chef's kitchen dining room which seats about 10 and through the gorgeous indoor restaurant that will make you feel like you're in a castle dining room and walk out to the patio covered in candles featuring a fountain and ensconced with flowers It's one of the most romantic restaurants in the Valley I've ever been to and it re-opens Friday October 4 after new ownershipEvery night Cafe Monarch features a unique three-course prix fixe menu based on seasonal items and Chef Andrew Nienke's taste Call ahead if you have special dietary needs and they'll adjust the menu accordingly for youI went there last week with some girlfriends -- thank you so much to new owner Christian Lewkowicz for the invitation -- and had one of the freshest meals I've ever had We started with a watermelon salad which came with huge chunks of juicy watermelon and a bed of fresh greens I love watermelon salad and this one was extra-tastyMy pals had salmon and filets for their entrees while I got to nibble on quinoa topped with fresh carrots and leeks The portion size was huge and left me stuffedFor dessert we were treated to freshly baked puff pastries topped with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream I slurped up every bite of the dessert which was light and refreshing and managed to seem healthy because of the fruit My favorite part of Cafe Monarch though was the atmosphere and hospitality The service was amazing and made you feel like you were in your own little world -- perfect for an anniversary dinner or special get-together Our meals would have cost $45 each which was a steal for such unique culinary creations and such top-notch ingredients The relaxed atmosphere will transport you out of the Valley for a night and make you feel like you're in your own private retreat.
Great service as soon as you walked into the door as well as when you leave The decor was very cute wooden beams and exposed steel for those who like contemporary (me) There were three of us and we each got the soup special of the day (salmon chowder) I was skeptical I like my salmon either smoked or sushi raw but this was delicious My the soup was served with a slice of foccacia breadWe split the beet salad and the pesto pizza The beet salad was refreshing The only thing i would do differently is have the goat cheese ball (served on the side of the salad) warmed up Nothing beats warm goat cheese The pesto pizza was great as well Had that nice brick-oven-taste to it (thin crust -not burnt not too thin) This would be a great place for a 1st date luncheon business lunch etc.
No dings on this one Always a great time and the food is terrific Service is friendly and personal Drinks are generous Perfect up scale dinner house light level - makes everyone look good I can't think of anything I would change The house rotisserie chickens are featured in a showcase on the south side of the buildingI'm sure just to get you salivating (Also check out their "Flying Chicken" - under the radar takeout via the back door Very Cute) Not a huge menu but lots of comfort items great variety and consistently excellent all the way Deviled eggs cornbread gets a big thumbs up and I'm a big fan of the Macho Salad I could eat that everyday Can't wait to go again Soon.
This place is so good the cashier were so friendly and helpful I saw the owner there and we had a good conversation about the startup of the business would definitely recommend this family owned business.
The best bar in the valley to see live music  The food is good the drinks are reasonable and the bands ROCK.
Glad I tried itI had an extremely negative experience at the Biltmore location that I was hesitant to try this location but so glAd that I didDelicious food and good service.
Been going to 6 since it opened Always gave it thumbs up because it was always classy and you meet some cool people in there Especially during the weekBUT in the last year or so it has taken a nose dive Yeah sure it packed with the  population growth this area has seen in the last 5 years any club in the Stetson rd area will be packedThe lighting in there sucks it's so hard to see who you are talking to The DJ's typically play the same stuff all the other clubs do so it basically the flavor of the month I like clubs who have balls to play something totally different If something changes soon they may hold their good rating but for now I got to go low.
YUM.
I searched coffee and found this gem What a delightful little shop Fresh homemade chocolates fresh everything I was so pleased with everything The prices are more than reasonable The owners are present they actually work there Very pleasant folks I highly recommend Rayner's.
Staff was amazing There was a wide selection on the menu and everything was high quality The red snapper is what I have and it was delicious my husband had the Chilean sea bass and he loved it The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated and very comfortable We will return and we highly recommend this restaurant.
I have never been more impressed with the attention to detail Dwayne and his wife put into the entire menu From the time you watch Sarah mix your first drink you will realize this place is carefully thought out and time and effort is spent creating a Jamacian experience that is authentic and delicious Eat and drink your way through the menu and you will be amazed.
WowMy boyfriend suggested this place and when I asked him the type of food he mentioned something about burgersafter taking a look at their reviews on Yelp figured it would not hurt to check it outThe service was great our waitress was extremely friendly and prompt with getting us refills on our chips & salsa - which we needed a lot of because they were amazingly good The salsa had the perfect amount of seasoning to make it spicy enough to have you going for more without burning your mouth off The chips were warm out of the oven and I could have ate a basket fullThey offer Sangria (white or red) by the pitcher - sure enough we ordered a red one It was really good and I was pretty lit after my first drinkI had the Chimichilada - you get a choice of beef or chicken chimi I had the beef and you also get a portabella mushroom enchilada This dish was delicious and will go back for more You get a lot of food on this plate so you will more than likely have enough for lunch the next day and it was just as divine a day laterMy boyfriend ordered the Blue Adobe Hamburger which was voted onto Phoenix's top 10 - hence why I thought it was a burger jointWe had a wonderful experience amazing good and will be frequenting Blue Adobe more often.
My daughter brought me here after having attended a yelp event I had the lobster roll and added the fries The bread on the lobster roll is the best It is just like you get back east and was perfectly toasted The whole sandwhich was really great and the salad that comes with it had just the right amount of balsamic The brown sugar butter sauce that comes with the fries is really tasty I also had the lemon bar and fruit for dessert It had lots of great flavor without being overpowering What really stood out was our server Allard was so helpful and nice He brought us a dinner menu since I wanted to come back and try more and aswered all the questions I had about what was on it He really took time to help us and kept our drinks full and was very sweet I can't wait to go back and try more It was all so good.
I was very disappointed in the customer service that I received from Jiffy Lube  I went in with a coupon for a 2999 oil change and walked out pay $80 for services that were not discussed beforehand  When dealing with mechanic's I've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind  I am in need of an honest mechanic that isn't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer  I will never return to this place again.
I'm always happy to support local businesses and was happy to see something new opening instead of closing on Mill Ave However Poppa Maize's popcorn is well how do I put this horrible We tried the chocolate peanut butter and cake batter last night and threw out full bags after a couple of bites Even my kids wouldn't eat it and they are usually like human vacuum cleaners The texture was like styrofoam and both flavors were oddly bitter I don't know if the popcorn was old or if it's always this bad but I don't want to try it againHoping they can somehow fix their mistakes sounds like they have some fans and are capable of much more than what I tasted.
Contacted Real Fast about tiniting the windows in my new car  Joe and his guys price was much less then the dealership and I was very happy with the resultsWe noticed some to the tint peeling up and Joe's guy came right out and resolved the issueVery good service.
Did not have high expectations for the evening It had been a few years since I been to McCormick & Schmick's in Pasadena CA and they did not impress the several times I visited A recent visit to Spenger's in the Bay Area (my old stomping grounds) which had been in decline for years netted a wonderful meal I noticed it had been acquired by M & S  This night did not disappoint  It was a quiet Halloween night and the ambiance was reserved and almost romantic Hot sourdough rolls were a good start Moved onto the flashed fried calamari with a trio of sauces It was light and perfectly done I had side spinach salad my husband the house salad Both were fresh a good size and not overdressed My main was the Lobster and Seafood Steamer It was larger than I expected for the price The seafood steamed in white wine were were perfectly done Came with garlic bread and I just sopped up the sauce Mmmm My husband had the San Francisco Shellfish Stew It had some similarities to my dish but it included fish and the Tomato Fennel Broth was aromatic and delicious as wellI finished the evening with a lovely light bread pudding with Creme Anglaise sauce I was impressed especially for a chain It was a good night I'll be visiting again.
I really enjoyed myself here  The atmosphere is really cool  My girlfriend says the smell of the burning fireplace reminded her of Aspen you could smell the wood burning when you pulled into the parking lot  The service was excellent and the food was also very good  We ate downstairs at the bar and chose a few things off the small plates section of the menu  They also had a lot of fresh fish choices on the specials board  I would definitely come back here again.
I love Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan  The owners are very friendly and almost always available  The food is delicious and always fresh  It's a short drive from Fiesta Mall on Southern and it's definitely better than the McDonald's eyesore next to it  I recommend the sushi and my boyfriend loves the chicken katsu  I like the big windows and friendly vibe.
We love this place The food is very good with large portions and the prices reasonable We go there at least once a week The taco salad is great My husband says the tacos are very good and the cheese crisp was the best he's ever had.
Great food at really reasonable prices very clean Mesquite fries are amazing  I don't think many people know about this place but they should  One of my favorite places to grab lunch  Love that the owner is usually there  Love even more that he recognizes me and strikes up conversation with me  The American Classic burger is the best burger I have found in the East Valley and for $6 you can't beat it.
Recently discovered this gem Cool loft-like space good coffee and great people watching with an eclectic urban mix that makes me feel like I'm in a real city  This is the kind of place that makes you want to pick up a magazine find a comfy chair and settle in for the long haul.
One of my favorite places to go Food is great and the patio is a nice place to hang out with friends.
FEZ You have redeemed yourself I love you again Service this time around was amazing Thomas the general manager is super fun Monica our server did a great job The food was delicious I had the lamb chops To die for My friend had the rib eye Also very good Oh Fez I will come back to you again and again.
What can I say It's a candy warehouse If you like only the white gummy bearsyou can buy only the white gummy bears This place has a lot of those throw back candies that are hard to find I highly recommend this place if you have a sweet tooth or if you are looking for something in particular They have something for everyone young or old.
Sometimes you just want a good burger and fantastic service  Is that so much to ask  Burger a little pricey but so perfectly cookedThe service was so friendly attentive and helpful  It was my first time in the tempe/pheonix/scottsdale area and my server Jasmine was incredibly helpful in giving me ideas on what to doBrian the manager was fantastic in making sure we were well taken care of and everything was spot on  And their happy hour is fantastic  Home run and great first meal in AZ.
The WORST W I have ever stayed in I am a Starwood member and have stayed all over the US in W's And SLS and have never experienced such piss poor service Went here for my bachelorette party over the weekend and they lost my girlfriends credit card then proceed to tell her they gave it back which NEVER happened Told them to review the tapes but the rude Chinese manager didn't want to hear it Ordered room service and the guy added his own $7 tip on a meal that had $3 gratuity included already I don't know who is hiring these unprofessional employees but they are rude and act like the W is the greatest thing around Um NO your bar scene sucks you have dried out "fresh" flowers in vases making it look just tacky and the shop in there looks like stuff my Hip 71 year Old grandma wears I'm giving 1 star to the valet guys and the sweet lady at concierge Stay as far away from this dump as possible it's a glamorized motel 8.
My boyfriend and I were excited to try the new Vig and stopped in on Saturday night  The atmosphere was awesome and they really did an amazing job remodeling the previous space  The outdoor patio area is fantastic and I would love to enjoy it more as the nice weather is approaching  However we will never be back due to the terribly poor service we received  We started with a couple of appetizers including Ceviche  Our server never checked back with us after dropping off the appetizers so we flagged down another staff member and requested some additional tortilla chips for our Ceviche  And then the waiting game started  In the meantime our server dropped off our meals and said the chips would be out shortly  Someone eventually brought us some chips and at that time we asked for additional tortillas for our fish tacos as they only come with three tiny tortillas about the size of a half dollar  Well the tortillas never came and our server never checked on us again  We eventually had to flag her down after our half eaten food got cold to ask for the check  I would understand slow service if it had been extremely busy that night but it wasn't  We were blatantly ignored by our server and got no apology  In fact it was almost as if we were a nuisance to her  And by the way the food is mediocre at best  There are way too many other great places to eat downtown to give this place another chance.
This place is like candy land for auto services These guys really know what they are doing and their recommendations are worth listening to I came here to get tires stretched on my 18x95 wheels after not finding anyone that could do it near my neighborhood They made sure to take care of my wheels while I left them to install the tires and when I picked them up there was not a scratch on them I'm glad there is a shop like them that does what they do.
Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club is exactly what the name would imply a place to have dinner/drinks while eating dinner The unspoken part is that it is FUNManagement requests that you make reservations and it helps to secure a good seat You place your order before the movie starts and receive your food during the previews The staff is helpful and operates very quietly throughout the film The movies are second-run During a recent newsletter ownership explained that the market power of the multiplex (Harkin's) prevents them from getting the first run movies The selection is good They generally show 4-6 movies and I have seen Casino Royale Blades of Glory POTC: Black Pearl and Spiderman III there The food is good but a little pricey I always order the Chicken Farrelli (chicken artichokes potatoes) which is phenomenal The menu includes appewtizers salads burgers sandwiches and entreesFor something a little different and BETTER than the multiplex try Farrelli's.
OMG Foodie heaven Michelin star good Just go.
wow this place is poppin I went here w my fiance to eat and we met the owner George himself since he was working the register We told him we were from out of town and asked about the different gyro's they served- He was so nice he hooked us up w two sodas and the food was only $7 Huge portions and fresh flavors Def coming back when I am in Arizona again Great customer service.
My original review seems to have disappearedAnywho love these guys I was introduced to their deliciousness at Yelps pleYdate A few months later I contacted them about cupcakes for my husbands birthday Lana was so awesome She tweeked one of her delicious recipes specifically for us Our fave shot is an Irish Apple (Irish whisky instead of Crown Royal) so she turned her Washington Apple cupcakes into Irish Apples and they were soooooo delicious We also got the Irish Car Bombs so good Lana even worked w/ me on a time and place to pick them up My husband was super surprised and thought they were absolutely great SuccessAffordable prices delicious product and awesome people Could you ask for anything more.
A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on "The List"  Yeah no thanks I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff onlineIf you do decide to bother with this place call ahead Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale  While calling also ask how to get put on "The List" because that info isn't on their site either.
My family and I went to brunch there on Sunday late morning The place was pretty empty except for the bar that was full Nice enough place Been here for late night but never for Brunch Well the food took almost 40 minutes to come out The bacon was mooing It was disgusting I almost had to tackle the waiter to get his attention Very very expensive for a I don't really care attitude by all who work there.
My husband and I have been here many many times and usually meet up with old friends for a few drinks at least two to three times a month We like that it is a small dive bar and located near out house However there have been many disappointing visits The wait staff is NOT friendly or inviting One blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude We patiently waited for her to come take drink orders and/or bring a menu finally we just flagged her down  for a menu She seemed irritated and threw the three  menus on our table My husband asked the bartender about the special $2 shot which is posted on the wall He ordered three $2 shots for then when we received our tab he charged us full price When we asked about the price it the blonde rude waitress started yelling at us and said she doesn't care what is posted on the wall she's not giving us the $2 special We have given this place many chances and every time we are disappointing we decided this place was NOT worth our money nor our time Skip it and try another bar.
I went there yesterday because of the Yelp reviews which have done me very well in the pastThere slogan is "Now that's a sandwich"It was definitely a sub sandwich but a really disappointing one and I really wanted this place to be good It is so difficult to find good mom and pop sandwich shops here in the valley The Yelp profile state they have wait service They do not I ordered the Dyker Heights Pastrami and Melted Swiss w/Sauerkraut and dressing which is thousand island The Boars Head pastrami was good but there was hardly any cheese on it It was mainly sauerkraut and the dressing was non existentThe sandwich is served hot but when I took my first bite either the pastrami or the kraut or the dressing was ice cold so it was an odd and unpleasant textureI would never order that sandwich againI got the red potato salad and it was bland I was putting black pepper and red pepper flakes on it in order to taste something Finally I got a Cherry RC from the fountainI didn't taste any cherry I have a buddy that really likes the food there so I might go back with him and see what he orders One thing that was confirmed for me if you're going to eat pastrami swiss and kraut do it on rye bread.
Seriously the staff & Dr Marc are more than fantastic glorious dental care I was with them for 5 years before having to move to CA I was so sad to leave them behind I even had a filling that felt loose & emailed them within 3 minutes I had a reply When I did find a new dentist Sher're called to make sure I was doing well Very responsive caring and detailed Dr Marc is so delicate with you I have a serious fear of drills he let me turn up my ipod as loud as I could & made sure I was comfortable throughout All the hygienists & specialists are professional down to earth & genuinely care about your dental health.
Amy is one of the best hairstylists I have ever been to I went to Pucci salon yesterday for a haircut/style and was very impressed with how much time she took to find out exactly what I wanted and to show me different ways I could style my hair on my own She was very friendly during the haircut and I loved hearing her stories about being a celebrity stylist I will definitely be returning Thanks Amy.
I work in the building so grabbing a quick lunch is convenient  however each time I get sucked back in -I regret it  I went in today for and ordered a BLT- $850 w a drink and chips3 slices of bacon and GREEN tomatoes  Since I'm still hungry i will find a real value in the vending machinesI need a shock collar to prevent my return in the future.
05/05/10Another great update from the Smokehouse Grill-- the Steak and cheese sandwich (comes w/ your choice of side) one of a few on the daily specials' board  The waffle fries alone would make any meal worth the daily special price but my pick today was just shoe-dropping good  The meat was cooked just right- superbly seasoned and had great texture  I love onions best when they're caramelized and these had a nice bite to it and added just enough sweetness to counteract the saltiness of the cheese  Oh but don't forget the bread  These had a great crusty exterior and yet soft inside Yum  I want another please.
After Audrey kicked me out of the pad I went for a drive I ended up in north Scottsdale with an appetite killer I found this Jack in the Box out here in Boondock Ville I ordered the Jumbo Jack no cheese 2 tacos and a Diet Coke I parked in the parking lot next to the Drive-thru I ate my meal Smoked a pack of cigarettes and watched cars show up and park in the shade It was around 2 am I pulled up thru the drive-thru for a second time and ordered a large Diet Coke I asked the attendant for directions for the Maricopa Food Handler Card Department The address read Peoria I always get Peoria and Paradise Valley confused.
I stopped by Hard Goods this past weekend after getting some ice cream at Churn As I walked in I tried to figure out what it was Is it a store Is it a galleryWhatever it was it's beautiful Amazing artwork and sculptural home decor line the walls vintage and modern furniture in the back and accessories in a display case in the centerI was greeted by Lucas and expressed my interest and curiosity of what I was walking into As he spoke I took everything in and his words made sense It's a store which carries unique and eclectic works by mostly local artists He explained that the owner of the store is a master concrete craftsman and created the store as means of both an artistic outlet and as a way to support and promote other local artists and designers I never knew that there were so many talented artists and craftsmen in Phoenix While the store has a rather masculine vibe to it there really is something for everyone (well except the beard conditioner that's definitely for men) There are wooden sunglasses and bowties (yes us women can wear them too) leather iPhone sleeve and aluminum iPhone cases soap air plants cast concrete succulents and even concrete feet Then there's the creme de la creme an original Herman Miller Eames chair I've wanted one for so long If only I had an extra $3000 laying aroundI'm so excited to see a new store like Hard Goods in this neighborhood and I can't wait to go back and see what new things are in store for me.
I love the Mongolian beef with noodles & have getting here for years I was glad to see no Arpaio in sight & the doors back open My wife loves the Dan Dan noodles & the kids get honey seared chicken I stop in this crazy busy location only when I'm in the area because the parking lot is insane I think the concept is great & the service is always quick Consistency is the key to this place.
I've recently started hiking Piestewa Peak (I feeling like I'm cheating on Camelback) and I think I'm in love  This is a great hike that gives the stairmaster a new name  The views are amazing and its not too crowded  Parking can be hard to find but it's worth the hunt for a spot to hike this awesome trail.
Of course a 5 Star I have my Arin I know I can always run into and share some killer MAC N CHEESE with and a bottle of Chambord Love this place.
It didn't even take longer than 3 minutes into our meal before everyone was thanking me for recommending Cafe Carumba as our lunch venue on Friday How could I recommend anything else though It was close to the office I hadn't been there before and well they serve breakfast til 2pm EVERY DAY There was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience A large group of us gathered there on Friday and when I arrived we had received a room in the back all to ourselves with a long table It was absolutely perfect Our server was a true gem We had waters on our table when we arrived and he put up with our wishy washyness when it came to our orders I started off with a mimosa that despite being pulpy which I typically don't care for was absolutely enchanting It came in a wine glass instead of a champagne glass More is better :)As it came time to order I couldn't move past the breakfast menu and thought I had settled on the perfect treat Then I was told by the server there was an underground breakfast menu that included five different types of eggs benedict Yes you heard me correctly I did say five There was the traditional one one with avocado one with portabello one with crab cakes instead of an english muffin which a coworker got and the steak one that I decided to try When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot We began to worry that we would be eating without everyone but that worry lasted maybe 45 seconds as instantly the rest of the food was brought out Silence followed for at least the first 10 minutes aside from messages of thanks and grunts of happinessThe potatoes are as heavenly as everyone says you need to have them I also recommend the eggs benedict with steak instead of canadian bacon I typically down my breakfast (ask anyone) but I couldn't finish my last eggs benedict I did manage to have two mimosas though YumAt the end of the meal the sever brought me out a foil rose which I've attached and still have Why can't all men be as sweetIn the end the food is phenomenal the mimosas are exquisite and larger than the ones elsewhere service is prompt and extremely friendly I will be back again.
If I could rate zero stars I would This is the first time Yelp has failed us dearly Awful service (the headchef sat us) and the menu isn't even close to what is actually served When we finally got our appetizer "heirloom tomatoes" really meant hothouse tomatoes When the soup showed up about 30 minutes later it good the salad was not Fast forward another 45 minutes when dinner arrives: what I expected to be something along the lines of chicken scampi arrives as chicken parmesan on a bed of spaghetti and tasted like cardboard smothered in tomato paste I'm not one to rate low by any means but both Yelp and Verona failed us this evening The only thing worth coming for was the wine I hope Sunday brunch is better but after this scouting event chances are I'm not going to find out.
You buffed You shined You commented on my behind Yep Tony I'm upping you a star sir$40 to spruce up my favorite Johnston & Murphy hand made Italian shoes for my launch party was the Deal of the Century And it took what a couple hours New heels New insoles Did I mention buffed and shined Oh Yep I did Get your shoes a makeover at Tony's Tell 'em Thomas sent you.
Still live in Flagstaff still love The Duce and I'd like to think DJ Luis is still my bff even after all these years While I love the overall atmosphere and drinks Luis and his karaoke/music playing prowess are basically why I go out of my way to stop at the Duce whenever I'm in town He has pretty much any song you' d ever want to hear or sing and he's totally cool no better place in town to sing karaoke and there's plenty of room on the dance floor to get down.
I've been to now two locations and love it the same every time We always order the Chicago and are always pleased My family is from Chicago and have found our very own taste of home every time we go here service is great and quality needs no explaining I already miss the city but know a memory is only around the corner try it yourself thank me later.
I took my 2013 Hyundai Sonata for an oil change Very Nice facility professional & knowledgeable staff I was very pleased with overall experience  Will take all my vehicles to CarLife They even offered me a soft drink or water as I waitedDefinitely the place to go for an oil change.
Zumba on Friday night with Bethany is the BEST.
Not greatDON'T waste your calories  The cake was dry over cooked and very bland tasting  Frosting did not have a lot of flavor and was way too sweet   We picked up 7 different cupcakes for my birthdayand I tried all 7  Honestly I could make better cupcakes out of a box  Plus waiting 10 minutes at the counter for someone to come to the front to wait on useven when I said "HELLO" several times trying to let them know we were there  Meanwhile two other people came in and waited awhile and then left  When they FINALLY came to the front counterno apology or explanation  I so WISH I WOULD HAVE USED MY BIRTHDAY CALORIES on NOTHING BUNDT CAKES next door  What a waste of calories  DEFINITELY go to NOTHING BUNDT CAKESthey are ALWAYS FRESH moist and wonderful flavor.
Can't believe I never reviewed this particular B Dubs Being right across the street from my work I spent many lunch hours here eating Buffalitos or wings playing trivia and catching up on the previous night's games  Quite a few Sundays as well since I'm a Bears fan and my girlfriend loves the Steelers so we had to end up somewhere we could both catch our gamesLove the Buffalitos They are tacos except with grilled chicken and your favorite wing sauce I usually went with hot but you almost couldn't go wrong with any flavor  Served with chips and salsa it made a great lunch when you didn't feel like gettin messy with the wingsNow that I have moved to the Chicago area I'm really gonna miss this place  Good thing there are B Dubs all over around here as well.
this made going to the movies fun againvery comfortable chairs spacious decent foodthe servers were nice and courteous  I really enjoyed going herewill definately come again.
By far my GREATEST yoga experience to date The studios are neautiful and peaceful the people who work there are great and the instructors are A+ You've not experienced yoga until you've practiced at At One My personal favorite instructors are Max Julie Jen C Johanna and Alex Definitely check it.
My father owned this bar back in the 70's till late 80's called Mr Nice & Nastys.
this is the tiniest little store but i love it the owner is the nicest lady ever i love to support these little stores she's a mom herself and you can just tell she enjoys maintaining and is very proud of this store they have great prices on resale items and carry a few new items here and there i found a mobile i've been eyeing for a while it was less than half the price of a new one and in wonderful condition i was so thrilled this will be a common stop for me.
I love shopping at this store I always get great dresses that are comfy and decently priced They also have a great selection of preowned clothes in the back too The acessories and fab as well I love their selection of earrings and someone they work with or know makes these awesome leather cuffs They have paintings incense candles and so much more They ladies that work there are great helpers while shopping and super nice to talk to as well.
For vegetarian fare these guys are tops in my books  I've always wanted to eat vegetarian because I knew it was healthy but every vegetarian place I've been to (or every vegetarian recipe I've cooked for that matter) has been very  un-delicious  Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken  It was quite satisfyingIt's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you  It works with this place And don't forget to ask about save room for and try a Tsoynami (a frozen ice-cream-blizzard-like treat).
Outstanding  I get my haircut every week so I have high standards  I just moved here from Texas and was pretty worried about finding a new barber  This place has not let me down  No need to worry about finding the right barber either  All of the staff are very good at what they do.
I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood but it did I will get to my reasoning but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere they have delicious food and they have friendly staff Rice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose fromMost importantly is the food The food here is delicious It's the perfect combination of filling yet light We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has "spice" mentioned at all in the description be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha The spring roll was delicious but so spicy my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it Rice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day) I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables It was the perfect meal It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma I can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal.
Great location quick drive thru and friendly service  This store is BIG and has been renovated  It's a great location to study read have a meeting or just enjoy a cup of coffee and relax  It's on the corner so the location is convenient to get to  If you love starbucks stop by this one for sure.
This is a great restaurant  The hummus is silky smooth and is perfectly seasoned  It also had an interesting flavor that sets it apart (and above) other versions I have had at other restaurants  Several flavors of hummus are available  The grape leaves are tight warm rolls that have a nice mint flavor  I also tried several sandwiches that were very good  I will definitely make it back for dinner to check out the entrees  Great service great prices - it is nice to have a quality Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood  It is locally owned and operated too which is nice.
I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight  The lobby salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuceI hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up.
What a great local spot Have been here several times and have never been disappointed Took a good friend here from out of town a few weeks ago and he still goes on how great the burger was and how awesome the prices are  Make a visit you won't be disappointed  Waiter also told me that the patio is dog friendlywhich I will try when the weather gets better.
This place did not deserve a $100 nevermind the $75 they charged for 2 mani/pedis They barely rub your feet legs They cut me and my husband many times while doing a manicure They are NOT friendly at all The woman next to my husband had her cell phone and items on the little table and the nail tech knocked into them knocking them to the floor and the nail tech laughed and didn't even say sorry The woman was really upset as I would have been At the end I decided to tip but not even close to what we normally would tip of course The nail tech had the nerve to count the money in front of us and then look at us with a dirty look REALLY You are lucky you got ANYTHING AWFUL & A WASTE OF MONEY.
as the holidays fade into the calendar behind me i reflect back on the month of december and i realize i spent the entire past month attending an ocean of parties drinking a river of christmas cocktails and wading through a forest of friends at random gatherings in a haze of booze and mistletoeit was festive it was fun and it was exhausting as i scroll back through the rolodex of 2010 holiday memories the R Bar most certainly stands out as one of my top 5 favorite eveningsour very big group of holiday revelers was initially seated indoors as we waited for a circle of chairs surrounding a fire pit to free up right after we ordered our first round the sweetheart of a hostess ran over to let us know the party sitting there had just closed their tab and we could pounce on the coveted area once our group was seated outdoors in over sized lounge chairs beneath twinkle lights by a crackling fire i took note of the rest of our surroundings stunning a striking desert rock formation as a backdrop waterfalls roaring a moat trickling through live music filled the air laughter conversation clinking glassesi don't know if it was the group i was there with the energy of the crowd or that everyone seems to be in an especially happy mood during the holidays but the air had an electricity to it that night i settled back into the cushions poured myself deep into a cocktail and let me date hold my hand  we ended up staying until closing time and then finally moved onto a new venuealas R Bar is the kind of place you don't remember much about the service because it was so flawlessly executed you don't remember the name of your drink only that it tasted divine and you barely remember the conversations you had only that you laughed the entire timehowever you DO remember you hated leaving and couldn't wait to come backPS: ok i lied i did remember ordering the rose margarita a few times and yummmm.
Friendly most helpful staff ever  Free attentive water testing appears to be family owned  I dig emThe final words:  Popcorn machineNeed I say more.
This Starbucks has some of the friendliest people of any Starbucks I've ever been to They are incredibly nice and they always make my drink perfectly Love it.
Usually I would give this place 5 stars but tonight I was pretty disappointed with the service I have gone on Friday nights when it is super busy and I still get 5 star service Me and my friend went tonight July 15 2013 because she wanted to use her coupon for a free birthday bowl when we arrived we waited at the front for the hostess to seat us for 10 mins then my friend just grabbed two bowls and napkins herself then we sat ourselves at a table usually this isn't a big deal but the fact that we waited for 10 mins is ridiculous because it wasn't busy you would think on a night that it was slow it would have been a good night to go but i guess we were wrong then when we tried to use my friends free bowl coupon the server told us that it had already been used even though she showed the server that she just got a email reminder that she needed to use the coupon before it expired on the 26th I understand when you put a code in and it doesn't work but the fact that the server seemed to get a little rude with us was uncalled for we weren't being rude to her we were just curious to why it wasn't working and the fact that there was no onsite manager there was stupid i just wanted to bring it to someones attention that the hostess was nowhere to be found when we tried to get a table and i'm sorry if you don't want to do your job then why are you working there when there are plenty of people out there that would be able to do you job with a smile on your face I just have to say i'm really disappointed with the crew that was there tonight it seemed like there were problems all night while we were there especially with the hostess very unorganized so if your trying to go there on a Monday night because it's not that busy I would say don't because you will get better service on the weekends I will not be going back there anytime soon.
If I never want to sit in a Chili's for 3 hours I won't go to this location anymore Only 3 of us 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said "Oh you'll have plenty to eat" Well he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff Then he told us we needed cocktails Uh no we wanted sodas/tea He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing He's had the darn thing before  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever Then he came over complaining about "Women" and something about seeing the movie "The Hobbit" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $70  Hello I'm a woman and I want to see the movie  I would have paid $770 to get the heck out of there  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them ICK  I do have to say the food was good though Also hot so at least we got that part.
Probably the BEST restaurant I have EVER been to in my LIFE The place is phenomenal You walk into a very classy atmosphere and everyone is dressed to the 9 We were having a company dinner here so we were escorted to a lovely private dining room with sliding glass doors to enter and red velvet curtains lining the room Who ever had the idea of Lobster Mashed Potatoes is brilliant I loved those chunks of lobster in my potatoes it was probably one of the best side dishes I've ever tried We also got sides of the Gorgonzola mac and cheese and the sauteed mushrooms amongst other things all which were amazing But the steak  it was probably the BEST steak I've had in my life Perfect cut perfectly cooked tender and juicy as ever truly the best filet I've ever ate Order the chocolate covered strawberries as a dessert because those are a must The staff - all very pleasant and polite Sue who helped coordinate my company dinner there was fabulous to work with She even worked with my hotel to coordinate car service for us Be prepared to empty your pockets but its worth every last penny.
Amazing ServiceAmazing food Must try everything at least once We almost did tonight Lol so flavorful and portioned just right.
Drove 5 hours with family after seeing on tripple DDD Food was fantastic I don't like Alfredo sauces but their chicken Alfredo was unbelievably fantastic as well as their subs and marinera sauce My family and I will be back This is highly recommended.
Astounding food and drinks I really can't say more.
If you go here ask to sit in Dan's section He was awesome Explained they menu had great suggestions and was very friendly My husband and daughter loved him as well I am very picky since I'm in the industry so to finally have great service was wonderful.
I love this place It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:Perfectly portioned and well-priced it's filled with chopped turkey Vermont Cheddar hard-boiled eggs crispy lettuce cherry tomatoes and corn I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing but there's also a vinaigrette option All that for just under $6I've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are I know if I am craving a big juicy burger I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall or better yet Five Guys when it opensThis was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not Take-out is obviously what the aim is here as seating is limited.
Does this restaurant get five stars because of it's ambiance food or great service  No  Don't get me wrong it was great food at a decent price but this review is slightly biasedSince work sent me out to Arizona for the weekend I got to see my brother who I only see a few times a year  It's weird as you get older the family that you wanted to get away from to become an individual is the one that you want to get closer and closer to  Though I had to fly out to Phoenix Saturday morning do some work then drive out to Sierra Vista early Sunday do some work and drive back to Phoenix the same day (Sierra Vista is about 3 hours away from Phoenix) I would do it all over again just to spend some time with himI did remind him that he gave me dog poop and told me it was chocolate when I was a kid though  That I'll never forget.
On a Sunday morning  we took in 80lbs of laundry because we didn't have a laundry room They were amazing And got it done in 8 hours Very clean place and super nice people Totally recommend them.
I LOVE this place The food is always good and I have never had a problem with the staff Their chips and salsas are amazing I visit here wth my family often and its alway been great.
Love love love this mall  It has everything.
This place rocks  Great food  great price  great serviceThey are busy but we usually can get a seat within ten minutes And the food comes out in seven minutesThey have it down to a science.
This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me it wasn't my choice I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY especially green chile When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the stateWhen we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said "Well we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican" and walked off WhatThe first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be hereI'm far from being a vegetarian I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it Also I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for thatI ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad  Iceberg lettuce slimy greens cooked onions and bell peppers mushy tomatoes half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell yuck If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.
I am a local and wanted something cool to do for my fiance's birthday and a friend recommended the Valley HoAnd I am glad she didWe stayed in the studio guest room she had a massage at HV Spa and we had dinner at Cafe Zuzu all of which were wonderfulOur room was huge private patio decent view comfortable bed and furniture Not only do you get shampoo bodywash the usual but even Qtips There are your standard water glasses as well as martini and wine glasses These little extra touches made it all the more enjoyable and worth the priceThe hotel is one of the coolest that I have ever stayed in It is in pristine condition everything is immaculate and sheik the decor and design is  a perfect combo of retro and modern that compliments the feel of the hotel The staff is helpful and out of their way friendlyIt is upscale without being pretentious trendy without being cheesy and an amazing experience that I would recommend to both visitors and locals alikeThe one negative is a $12 parking charge as other reviewers have mentioned.
I love Sephora  The associates are always friendly knowledgeable  and very helpful  They know the perfect colors for my skin type and for any occasion I am attending  They explain how to put on the product and what makes the product special  The products are expensive but they last for a very long time  I always get compliments on my make-up and I always buy from Sephora.
We had friends in town from out of state and wanted to take them to Corleone's since it was one of our favorite casual restaurants We were there on July 12 2010 around 1:30pm or 2:00pm When we walked in the door we were given the spiel about how much better Corleone's is than other cheesesteak places He (the manager) even went as far as to put down the other Corleone's restaurant on 16th street and Camelback in Phoenix that we frequent quite often like at least weekly sometimes a couple times a weekKeith (or so he said that was his name) the manager proceeded to  make cocaine and drug references about the food Saying that his creation flies out the door like cocaine good drugs and gold bars After we stated that we didn't appreciate the drug and cocaine references because we had a 14 year old girl with us he proceeded to make an inappropriate remark about her looking more "mature" than a 14 year old girl One of us left with the 14 year old and her mother When asked who the manager was he told us that he was and tried to shake hands After refusing to shake his hand and starting to walk out the door he said and don't ever grace my door againno problem we would NEVER go back It's sad that a person like this can ruin a very good restaurant for more than one location but I am seriously considering never going to another Corleone's since someone like that can be a manager.
An upgrade to five stars is necessary after weekly fish lunches for the past several months  I have managed to cycle thru the various seasonal "wild" salmon plus a portion of the other fish  For me it is hard not to order salmon but will be forced to make a change in the fall at the end of the season  Today was the Wild Kuskokwim River Coho Salmon summer salad with asparagus tomatoes blue cheese and fennel in an orange-soy vinaigrette  An excellent recommendation by the waitress versus my standard cedar plank roasted salmon that masks the rich mild salmon flavor  This time simply grilled and very very tastyWhat I am really beginning to like about King's Fish House is excellent service in the center section under my favorite fish  The mighty AK Chinook King SalmonI remember catching a similar King 20 years ago on the Kenai River in AK  My dad and I each caught Kenai King Salmon on separate days  Each fish was 42 inches long but mine had 27 inch girth and my dad's fish had a 26 inch girth  The scale was broken so never knew what they actually weighed (40 to 45 #)  My dad claimed his fish was larger so there you go  The photo of us holding the fish at sunset with a background river shot is proof of their size but not of their quality  As I recall they were the best tasting fish ever but 20 years is a long time to try to remember tasteAs far as service goes either waitress knows that I start with a Kiltlifter  but not the size - sometimes 16 oz and sometimes 22 oz  Both waitresses know I like salmon but if the same type of salmon is on the menu I have switched to sea bass or rock fish  Hard to believe but sometimes change is good but I almost always remember to go back to salmon the next time.
Just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum and it was everything I had heard and more - i was not disappointedbeautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks It was relatively busy but we were sat right awayMom had the BBQ chicken BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich as advised by the young and very pleasant server)we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt professional and pleasant the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi and after the crowd died down a bit he did and seemed like super cool down to earth guyi overheard him mention his "other restaurant" so on our way out i asked him about it he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about) i will be heading there on my next dining adventuredinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25 cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad the food was couturely presented and tasty)ps the parking lot was a nightmare all dirt and full of HUGE pits and deep tire tracks but wouldnt stop me from returning.
Delicious Bruschettas Great Wine & Beers and amazing customer service Everyone here is very nice and helpful I love the building and the area out back of the restaurant Although I mostly come here to have drinks after work I have eaten here a few times The Bruschettas are all good and you get to pick 4 different ones I have also been here for brunch Great coffee and the I got the Yogurt fruit and granola It was very good and it's perfect if you're looking for a light breakfast on the weekend Two thumbs up.
The Pita Jungle first opened in Tempe in 1994 I don't remember when exactly I first visited this location but it was probably that same year or in 1995 Since then I have probably visited this particular location somewhere between 50 to 100 times I'm really a big fan of this place because they were the first to introduce me to Mediterranean food Beforehand I was not familiar with words such as hummus baba ganoosh taboule or tsatziki Ever since I've been a big fan of Mediterranean food because of it's distinct flavors and healthy optionsThe Pita Jungle in Tempe has evolved physically from the restaurant I remember when I was younger It use to be only half as big as it is today Right around 2005 they purchased the store next door and demolished the wall that divided them thus increasing their space to accomodate their large patronage The parking lot they share with the small plaza they occupy however has not grown Beware the limited parking available during lunch hours on weekdays Pita Jungle can get really packedThe interior of the restaurant is decorated with various pieces of artwork from local artists on the walls which changes every so often The ceiling is decked with exposed ducts which give the location a kind of industrial feel to it Also the servers pretty much wear everyday clothing In all I kinda  get a California somewhat Bohemian-feel for the environment Although it's probably lost some of that in the past couple of years every since it's grownI've tried all sorts of dishes at Pita Jungle but my all-time favorite at this location is the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza When I use to work in Tempe I frequently chose this dish I really like all the other dishes I've tried at Pita Jungle I guess it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for My other recommendations if you are eating in are the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon Spicy Mango Shrimp and Chicken Del Sol I might point out that the Chicken Del Sol is a protein-rich dish containing chicken and beans It's a pretty healthy serving for the low price of 6 to 8 bucks I don't frequent this particular location like I use to Furthermore I've only had one bad experience at this location but why let one bad experience put a damper on my overall long patronage I'm kinda tempted to give it 4 stars because my tastes have differed over the years but I don't really have anything critically negative to say about this Pita Jungle so I would be willing to give it 5 stars.
Cibo has plenty of reviews but I still gotta put my two cents in I have been here several times all for lunch so I have NOT tried their pizza yet but the sandwiches and salads they serve up for lunch are nothing short of phenominal On my last vist I tried the Ai Spinaci which is a garlic lovers dream sandwich topped off with wilted spinach and toasted prosciutto All I hear is great things about Cibo's pizza so I can't wait to finally give it a tryThe restaurant is a beautifully converted house in a historic downtown area but that also equals very limited seating inside They have a great patio with more than ample overflow seating outside but it's pretty worthless during the summer days The servers here are all friendly towards the customers and work as a team to make sure the lunch and dinner hours run smoothlyAlso the crepes are amazing We never had any intention of ordering dessert but our server insisted on bringing us a complimentary crepe with the assurance that it'd be worth it WE LOVED IT Make sure you save room for dessert.
My husband and I love Toyama we started coming here after Mo opened (We used to visit him at a restaurant where he worked) this is by far the best sushi bar in the ValleyWhy might you askHere you go:*  My husband works in procurement for a major hotel company buying fish and beef - he knows fresh fish*  Did you ever talk to the customers at the sushi bar  Many are local Valley chefs - chefs only eat where there is good fresh food*  Friendly Sushi Chefs - The chef/owner is one of the sushi chefs he will explain fish to you help you try new things and is pretty creative  They treat their customers right  (And so does Mimi Mo's wife)*  Service Staff - how many servers greet you by name when you walk in and have your favorite beverage right up for you  Also Mo's had very consistent staff over the years meaning they like working there and get along*  Tempura - don't laugh - but one of the better tempura batters around - try itWe have been missing our weekly/bi-weekly sushi fixes lately due to travel but with the fall back we will see you at Toyama.
Nice waiters Great food You really due pay for the atmosphere and the ambiance in my viewits worth it  I dont see to many places with the feel this place has I just was on my way from Portland and was lead to this place unknowinglyand it was just what I neededWaiters are niceOne of the bartenders kind of an "one uper" but over all nice people to talk to Soon to be a duke.
After leaving a previous poor review I was consistently contacted by upper management trying to redeem themselves This restaurant is not near my home but I agreed to try them again and was promised they would send a certificate for dinner on them at our convenience  However it has been over a month now and I have yet to see anything I am still VERY unsatisfied with this company.
Looks like we maaaade iiiiiiitto review 200Now that I've got a Barry Manilow song stuck in your head (you're welcome) it's time to show some love for Postino my favorite local place before I was a Phoenix localFirst things first-the staff here is ridiculously nice They are friendly helpful with the menu and attentive this is a glass half full place As in my glass is never less than half fullPostino has a simple but solid menu of appetizers soups and sandwiches along with a killer wine list that gets rotated out seasonally My first visit here a couple of years ago (the downtown location) involved the Nine Iron sandwich a sandwich that will fulfill your dreams of bacon and burrata on a delicious carby pillow of your choice of focaccia or ciabatta I don't know if the bread is made in house but it's fresh and the ciabatta doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like it usually does at lesser sandwich shops They use the same ciabatta for their brushcetta board which comes in fun combinations like proscuitto and figs salami and pesto and brie with apples You get a choice of four different kinds and honestly if you're dining solo this makes a good lunch (or dinner) Their roasted red pepper soup has a cult-like following and I now know why Think of the most delicious tomato soup you've ever had and multiply it by 100 It's a soup that I would eat in the dead heat of summer because it's one of those comfort foods that knows no season-it's just GOOD They offer happy hour from 11A-5P $5 glasses of wine bellinis and mimosas and I've yet to have a drink that has offended me Everything is reasonably priced including a $10 pick two option of soup salad and 1/2 sandwich which is usually what I do Postino is on my short list of go-to lunch places single girl dinner places and places to bring out of town friends Also probably a good date spotworking on investigating that.
First time and I wasn't impressed Chicken is flavorless dry and way too pricey Will not return.
Fun course  You can use every club in the bagin as good of shape if not better than the high dollar courses in Scottsdale  Great place to sneak out of work early to play to get in my golf-fix.
I recently purchased a Ford Focus from Enterprise The whole process was so easy and surprisingly fast They gave me an excellent deal on my trade-in and made me feel very comfortable The car is fantastic and in great condition - I love it.
I wasn't so sure about going to this place but turns out that it was well worth the drive When I went the place was packed Despite the sheer amount of people there was room for parking and the service was still pretty fast The dining room is rather small but they manage to fit quite a few people in there The decor is nice and subtle Even though it was busy the hot tea came out hot as did our food They gave us a basket of rolls to eat while we waited which were warm and soft I had the Hakata Ramen It was awesome There is enough in the bowl to make two meals of it If you prefer large amounts of meat in your ramen I recommend getting the 'extra pork' version as the Hakata only has a few slices in it The broth was flavorful and the noodles were very soft As I looked around the packed room I could see other people's plates- and everything looked pretty darned good- I wish I could have eaten more I'll definitely be going back.
Slow Dirty  Bad food  What I have come to expect from the airport.
This place is great the food is so delicious and you have to try this place  you won't be disappointed.
WOW  Going to make this shortThis place is awesome because1  The pizzas are truly gourmet BUT you can get other five star dishes that have nothing to do with pizza as well (superb cheese/meat plates duck over quinoa wild fish etc)2  Even though this place is called "The Parlor" and a pizza place automatically comes to mind the atmosphere is nothing like a "pizza place" - very nice bar dining area and garden patioI'm not a big pizza fan but this is the best pizza I have had AND their other signature dishes (that have nothing to do with pizza) are excellent  Great wine list too.
Once again Marcus and the crew at McFall have gone above and beyond Today replacing my alternator They shopped around from parts suppliers to find me the highest quality replacement for the least money And had the part delivered and installed in about 1 hr Thanks again Life time customer right here.
Great pizza with really fresh cheese and a great pesto salad.
Really like the staff here they really go out of their way to help you with everything They have long lines and they are very busy But they seem to go through everyone really quickly and still have a smile and good information The lobby is always open as well which also makes it good because you can get most of what you need Including this time of year some boxes.
The owner is very nice and the gelato is the best in the valley We go on a regular basis and love it.
very good deli - not quite like the best NY delis but for being in Tempe it's OK.
BEST mexican food in the valley Beans are the BEST Enchilada's &amp Tacos are the BEST Pollo Fundido is very very tasty I usually stick to my usual routine: the "Muchas Cosas" plate: cheese enchilada folded taco (i always get beef) bean tostada beans rice &amp a flower tortilla You can't beat it I LOVE this place My only complaint not really a complaint just a preference is that I love the FLAVOR of the salsa but prefer chunkier salsa w/ fresh cilantro But the salsa they have is GREAT in folded tacos The chips are good but i prefer thicker chips but again thats just a preferenceThey are ALWAYS busy so get there early (or wait til later to go) They have a take-out window if your in a hurry Don't even worry about the neighborhood We just moved near south Phoenix from Chandler and its fine The ambiance inside is awesome and the hostess is very friendly You just can't go wrong here A++++ food.
It was a nice evening to go out to the Outback  Why not go and try out the new bar menu  Everything on the new menu was great  Between the cocktails and the apps  it was all awesome  So  the two flat-breads and the fried mushrooms were my favorite  Also the rum punch was my favorite drink  The other food they had were nachos and shrimp  It is always great to see friends that I know and meet new people at events  Thank you Lindsey and Outback for a wonderful evening out.
YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE If you haven't yetI got to go here back on July 15th while in town on business I have one here local to me so knew it was a great way to get away and grab some lunch and catch a movie I saw Grown Ups 2 and was really impressed with the Mall it's located in and the entrance and Premium Plus + seats are just amazing  Service was excellent as alwaysIf you've never been to a VIP theater this is worth it  Where else can you can be like your at home be served restaurant food and enjoy a movie all at one place  Plus the awesome thing is you can pick your seats out purchase it all from the iPad iPhone or Android app or on the web even a week in advance so you know exactly when you're going and where you are sitting vs showing up and hoping you get a good seat or a seat at all as you find with normal theaters Don't forget to with Premium Plus you get free Popcorn a recliner pillow and blanket with a personal waiter or waitress to get you drinks and food through out the movie.
Took my wife here for her birthday - she'd been wanting to try it for awhile and we'd never been - so I made a reservation and we went  We were definitely not disappointed  The ambiance was very nice and our server was polite attentive and very helpful  The house salad I started with tasted noticeably fresh and was generous in size  My wife had a rotisserie chicken which she really enjoyed  I had their special for the evening a lamb sirloin and I was delicious  Very flavorful and the sides (broccoli and mashed potatoes) were tasty as well - and I'm not usually a fan of broccoli  The evening was topped off by a birthday dessert of a banana/chocolate pie - again delicious  No complaints about the food service or ambiance  Wish we would have found this place earlier and we'll definitely be back  It's risen to the top tier on our list of Scottsdale restaurants  Highly recommended.
I love the Yard House  (I used to live in LA & the Yard House located on the pier in Long Beach is my absolute favorite place to lounge with friends)  The Yard House @ Westgate also has great ambiance  The bar is always a fun place to sit and outdoor seating is enjoyable especially when the weather is nice  Outdoors you can choose to sit in comfy patio chairs with cocktail tables or at regular tables that allow you a view of the center fountainsService--I've always had great service from the staff even on a crowded night  They always seem friendly and fun  They do their best to accommodate and make decent recommendations when you're not sure what to orderFood--The spinach dip is wonderful as an appetizer  I usually order the thai chicken or walnut pear salad which I always get with the dressing on the side in case I don't finish I tried the roasted turkey pot pie once which is HUGE and could feed 2 easily  It held up well and wasn't half bad reheatedBeer is ALWAYS good  I've never had a beer there that I didn't like and a while ago you used to be able to buy a whole 'yarder' where they served you a beer in a yard long glass  My out of town guests loved ordering the 'yarder' b/c it was a unique experience  Cost--I do have to agree with some of the other posters--the prices could be better but I enjoy it there so much that's just the trade off.
Very rude lady on the phone I cannot review how well they repair due to the bad customer service I was never able to schedule an appointment I called to get a quote and she refused unless I had a diagnostic even though I already had one and just needed to know if they have the part and how much it would be to install When I was trying to explain to her my situation she said thank you and hung up on me before I could ask any questions It was so mean and frustrating I figured she could be a little sympathetic to my situation seeing as how my house is 107 degrees and my air has been off for a week but I guess not She did not even ask if I wanted to schedule an appointment.
I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco green chile stew and pecan/fig pie) but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout  So many places have arrogant stuffy service so Scottsdale  Not so here  Also the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere reasonable prices and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us)  The food is rich but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce  Perfect portion size with a balance - meat grains and veggies  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood(Oh - and no valet  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots).
Great placeto eat  Atmousphere is nothing fancy but the food is awesome I have visited several times and each time seems better than the last  Skip the first couple pages of the menu and jump to the back  The first few pages are the americanized dishes  The back of the menu has the more authentic Asian dishes  Dinner sets offer a fantastic value and lots of food  Great place for family style meal with large group.
This place is a great find Friendly service  pet friendly patio reasonable prices and delicious food (we loved the pork & Mahi tacos ).
I grew up in a Vietnamese/Loa/Thai family the food at this place is reminiscent of the Thai food my family made when i was younger  don't come here expecting the same customer service as other American restaurant because you will be disappointed  - the owner is Thai and his English is only good enough to take your order  so if you want amazing service and non-traditional Thai food - then go to an Americanized Thai Restaurant like The Mint or Malees if you can deal with ok service and want good - authentic Thai food - then come here  and FYI - if you order it medium - it will be super spicy because so order 2 or 25 if you want it spicy.
I fly on standby sometimes and if it wasnt so dirty cheap to fly American Airlines I would fly Jetblue in a heartbeat The service is awful and the flight stewardesses are about as old and crusty as the airplanes I fly this airline every 3 months and they are incredibly disorganized but also for a 4 hour flight you only get beverages with a side of attitude DONT fly it if you have other options.
I have to admit I am not a big fan of waiting in lines I have to say that this was some of the best mexican food I have ever had It was worth the wait Their service was great I have lived in AZ for 20 + years and have never heard of this place wow I will definately be going back.
What is there to say about La Condesa It's simply amazing I'll admit we found this place searching for more of a day-to-day less expensive version of Barrio Cafe We found that and more In our one month since we've moved to Phoenix we've eaten here three times By far the best item we've had is the fried quesadilla with mole chicken Oh and the horchata Best Horchata Ever It's not your typical horchata so watch out Mole poblano tacos are also heaven as is the cochinita pibil Salsa bar is to die for I love the hole in the wall vibe Only bad moment was that I got trapped in the bathroom but that was my fault I swear the door opens out not in This place is super casual Plastic cups and nothing fancy but the vibe is uber awesome It is very small and seating can be limited but it always seems to work out I don't recommend this place for very large groups We'll be back about once a week.
Did you know it was $79 for walking in the door for one day or the way in advance tickets were $90 for TWO DAYS not just one dayYou really couldn't go wrong picking either day both were Great You didn't have to wait long anywhere and water was provided for you Many Area Restaurants participated and tried to impress you with tastings to razzie and dazzle youOn Saturday many offered good salmon but the one who nailed it was Switch Restaurant with a seared salmon unlike anyone's with a polenta cake arugula salad and a tiny Parmesan cheese crispThe most beautiful eye popping salad came from St Francis Restaurant with greens I never saw before so colorful so many textures words can not describeHeirloom Beets were popular and District American Kitchen had them in a easy to eat  cone salad with strawberries that was very good and North also had them in a salad with house made ricotta and fennelMaizie's  Cafe cooked up some real corned beef Reuben's on a marble ryeSome wineries and breweries were represented and one highlight was Mary Edwards with a very good Russian River Valley Pinot Noir conveniently located near all the SalmonThe one dessert that wowed me was the gold dusted lemon raspberry macaroon from The Four SeasonsOn Sunday Kobe sliders and Turkey apple sliders from RelishThe best pork might have came from Barrio Queen and her side of corn in a cup was so tasty anyone would agreeThe Breadfruit made great seasoned Mussels (who knew)Large shrimp in chili oil came from the House of TricksMaybe the best prepared fish was the Steal head Trout from Kai it just melted in your mouthI wasn't in a head cheese mood so I didn't try the fancy looking plate of head cheese from Petite Maison but I'd guess it was goodShort Leash dogs had a mini buffet spread of hot dogsTuck Stop had good muffulettas and Tammie Coe had very tasty Crack CakeBetty's Nosh had several of their popular mushrooms and a yummy light custardy light carmel bread puddingI couldn't mention everything that was good more more wasOnly one place I thought didn't do well preparing food in an out door environment all the meats were over cooked and dryThe only downside was some things that I liked the most I didn't see offered on the restaurant's menus that they came from.
I bring my car and my girlfriend's vehicle here for oil changes and regular maintainance My parents also bring their personal vehicles as well as their trucks and vans for their business to this shop Good service and prices keep us coming back.
This place has the best sushi in Phoenix   Make sure you bring your own saki beer or wine though.
Would give this shit place zero stars if possible  worst customer service ever people are rude and inconsiderate  Booked a one night stay in a patio suite and was downgraded to a double bed when I was supposed to get a king  Sorry sir since you booked your stay online we give you the worst rooms available.
A dozen or so cohorts and I gathered for last week's Vikings/Packers game and the service was spectacular We arrived 15 minutes before kickoff and as you can imagine the place was being overun with purple jerseys To accomodate our large party the manager opened up the previously roped off back room and gave us free rein of the joint It seems like the obvious play but you'd be surprised how many bar managers don't see the value in going the extra mile for bigger parties Our table shared a plate of nachos (A-) cheese bread (B+) and soft pretzels (A+) before diving into beer breads (A++) and burgers (B) It's not high brow fare but it is bar food done right As a Minnesotan I'm probably totally biased when it comes to reviewing a Vikings bar but I truly believe that the beer bread and Hop Knot are elite regardless of where you're from Wisconsin goofs included.
WARNING: LONG but THOROUGH review  :-)I've visited Briggs Family Dentistry twice now originally chose them based on prior reviews and the fact they've been received multiple "Top Dentists" awards ("Top Docs" edition of Phoenix magazine is where I first learned of them)Rates are on the pricey end but are competitive for the Scottsdale area and are accompanied by an amazing (dare I say "unbeatable") experience If you need extensive or pricey work done like me (two crowns) they also do what they can to aid in the financial department (payment plans cash discount) which is great for those of us who don't have dental insurance I love that they do NOT have high pressure sales but simply - honestly - state what kind of work you'll need or can expect in the future They also do NOT recommend unnecessary treatments as I've experienced with every other dentist (ie "you should get whitening this 'might' be a cavity so let's fill it" etc)My front teeth are sensitive to cold Additionally I've always dreaded the flossing part which proves painful BUT BOTH visits to Briggs resulted in 100% pain-free cleanings They also offer laughing gas if anxiety is an issueI've seen both of the Briggs (Dr Roger and Dr Bradley) and was pleased with each - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree From the front desk to the tech to the doctors to the billing/checkout EVERY staff member was incredibly *sincerely* kind patient and extraordinary Both my husband and I have never experienced anything like it and being that my hubby is Jamaican (black) this says something especially in North Scottsdale where (sadly) there is racism Briggs Family Dentistry is reminiscent of businesses in a time past - something that is so rare so unseen now days  As long as this persists I can guarantee my hubby and I will be life-long patients  In fact today I scheduled for a crown I need and cavity filings for the hubbyA final note: the true mark of a great businessman is his involvement in the community and willingness to give back (pro bono work) the doctors Briggs are regularly involved in both locally and worldly  :-).
"In a wordSerene"What can I say about the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa @ Gainey RanchIt was our first trip to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and if you enjoy the simple luxuries of a short-refreshing weekend to get away from it all this is the place to stay The property is secluded but yet a short drive to the main area of downtown Scottsdale The service is wonderful there were check-in kiosks and plenty of receptionists (it was a mid-afternoon check-in) The rooms were clean modern and typical of business style hotel as most hyatts sheratons and other hotels of the sort What stood out to us was the setting The hotel as you drive up has a large fountain in the middle of square (yes not circular) driveway and the hotel is just plain open You can see the large sitting area (where at night people gather to drink mingle and even roast marshmallows) Beyond that is what is a large pool area (1 adult only pool and a general-large all ages pool area) More about that in a minuteIf you veer to the right of the pool area and behind it is this small yet peaceful garden and beyond that was a full golf course Now the piece du resistance (for me anyways is the expansive pool area) The pool has the typical hot-tub poolside bar but beyond that it has small basketball hoop two volleyball nets a sandy beach section a couple of waterfalls and a 3 story water slide (excellent) Now could it have been the weather was beautiful (80 degrees in late October) combined with one of my favorite pluses to a hotel a large pool area honestly a pool area to either bathe in the sun sip a lovely beverage or dip in the pool to me that's a holiday (even if it was a short weekend getaway) holiday none the less Right the pool being expansive yet it didn't feel too large or overwhelming with tons of other hotel guests doing the same because then I would've gone to the adult only you would expect the pool area to be popular rightFor checkout there are two major pluses 1 it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home and it has spots for rental care return As for the spa my girlfriend's sister made use of it's services and for me I stepped into the reception area for nor more than five minutes with the combination of near whispering of the staff the soft gentle music and the rock laden water fountain I wanted to sit in of the comfy chairs and fall asleepBut you don't have to take my word for it In essence if you stay in the Phoenix /Scottsdale area whether for a short weekend or long holiday this has to be one of the choices to stay.
We love this place  Great variety and quality of good for a reasonable price  Delicious custard and other comfort food are a big draw for us.
Forget the gross fry bread at the fair This place is amazing I probably gain 5 lbs everytime I eat here but it's totally worth it The green chili shredded beef is awesome Nice people very clean and somehow its inexpensive.
This has always been one of our go too restaurants  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses and swarmed our table they wanted us out  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine  Not sure we will go back  I expect great service  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale.
This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management In the 5 years I've been going here I've had many incorrect orders been overcharged several times had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad) A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $399 to $499 the only McD's in the area that has done this So you know what I'm done with this location If I absolutely had to have McD's again it'll be somewhere else Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clueOne last tip to this location Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra which sometimes backfires when you actually get "extra" (better than not enough IMO but still way too much) Seriously you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a "normal" amount of sauce looks like It's not hard people.
Tops is hands down the best beer/liquor/wine store  The employees are always helpful with suggestions and they all know their stuff They usually have great sales on spirits or beers they are looking to clear from their inventory The only negative of this place is that their wine is overpriced.
Can you believe this place Awesome like an adult Candy storeEverything you could ever want for any type of party or event is at this storeThe candy choices are unreal I mean anything you could wantEven Candy you do not think they make any more at allAs Monica Oput it Candy Heaven and so it isIt is so worth it just to go here and see all the great things that they have to offerEven sugar free candy Love this store.
My husband and I entered the Steaks R Us building and were suprised to see it empty  The advertisement stated it was dine-in but we were directed by the staff to order our meal at the front counter even after I stated we wanted to dine-in  The gentleman took our order and added a 18% tip onto the check for himself  I did a quick math in my head and asked if he added a tip on the check for himself  With a straight face he said "We are supposed to add a tip on the check"  We had just ordered 2 Porterhouse steaks  He gave himself a over $1100 tip for making us order our food at the counterBEWARE.
If you don't love this place you have problems It's a dive It's delicious The prices are pretty decent It's unique It's delicious It's fun It's delicious Portions are big And it's pretty delicious You can sample a lot of their food before making a selection It's delicious.
This is a great dive bar with a little stage  I used to live right across the street from this place and when i needed to find something to do i headed over to this cool punk rock style bar its actually hard core  A couple of pool tables too Fun fun fun and inexpensive and just down the street is a convenience store and dance and strip clubs close enough for ASU students to get away from University and Mill Ave From LA to Arizona this is another one my favorite places besides the powerhouse (hollywood) the rusty spur (old townscottsdale) and the roadrunner (n Scottsdale) without feeling out of place.
I finally tried the Pepperoni Last week This was fantastic Original crust crunchy Pep all the right stuff.
This is THE place to go if you're a celiac Everything on the menu is labeled - and a big portion of the menu is actually gluten free The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and the food - well the food is amazing However it's VERY pricey - especially with all of those amazing cocktails (muddled strawberrys c'mon) I have only dined here for dinner but I loved every bite of it I would choose to go here for ANY special occasion They even brought out a free birthday GF dessert They're great go here as soon as you can.
Came for the amazing brunchWhat I love about their brunch is the options  For $33 you can get their buffet brunch which includes the better than usual goodies: omelet station crab legs already peeled shrimp lox fresh fruit warm breads various salads waffles grilled veggies and a dessert bar  Now to mix it up they also offer delicious items off their menu  These dishes range from $10 - $15 a plate but are fantastic and large  However if you want to then add the brunch buffet to your menu selection you can pay an additional $23  So in essence you can get the $10 pancakes and the $23 buffet and pay the same price as getting the stand alone buffet  I got the banana-pecan French toast off the menu  OMG it was perfect - especially with the warm "real" maple syrup  Service there is great and very attention driven  Even my napkin would be neatly folded by the time I returned to my seatWe came for a birthday and they had inscribed a nice note on top of the piece of dessert  A very nice touchI also love the ambiance and the grounds of the Royal Palms property  It's gorgeous there.
Had a positive experience here before but after calling and being told she could squeeze me in I came into the shop and was told sorry she was unable to help me  I normally don't give negative reviews it's just the way she treated me when I stopped in I asked if she knew anybody else around to help me and she shook her head and said sorry there's nothing I can do for you Which would not have been a problem if she had just been honest with me on the phone and had a little bit of customer service and some courtesy when I was in her shop She was short and abrupt and I won't be doing business here again.
I go to lunch here regularly and the food is consistent and excellent The owners are always friendly and recognize us when we come in The red lentil soup is amazing Falafel and hummus is really good too.
One of the oldest buildings in Tempe a real treat to be inside except during the horrible Arizona summers The building is swamp-cooled so it is huuuuumid during many days of the summer It is usually PACKED around dinner time (5-7) most days and especially on Thursdays The "DJ" plays pretty good music I put him in quotes because the few times I've seen the music system it's a Macbook hooked up to someone's itunes collection No problem with that though--me and the guy have pretty similar tastes in music The waitresses here are great nine times out of ten and they are always good-looking (do they even let males serve here) The barrel fries are great even if they are still $550 for a considerable deduction in the amount of fries you get recently They usually have a "special" or "chef's choice" menu where you can get something that isn't a usual menu item Good for dates The hefeweizen contains banana clove which is amazing The peach ale is a favorite among many women I know and Kiltlifter is always great if you're looking to take a nap soon (heavy) My only gripe is that the happy hour starts at 11 Sheesh.
Really great cut and service here definitely recommend and will be back for my next cut.
This place is awesome Great food good service The happy hour cant be beat.
This Fry's Rocks  It used to be Smitty's when I was a kid so I have an instant love for it already simply b/c the location is nostalgic but beyond fond memories-- this Fry's RocksWe bought a Patio Set- round table and 4 chairs AND a 3 burner BBQ with a sauce burner all for $28900  Such a bargainNot only is this place a clean well kept grocery store they sell like real stuff furniture decorations lamps bedding the works  Anyhow I had a great experience here with today's bargains  Now we can have our own little backyard patio party who wants to grill.
The owner is what makes this place POPPING Down to earth people and no bs I'm from California and I'm very meticulant on the type of pho I go to This is by far THEE BEAT OR EVEN BETTER THEN CALIFORNIA Try this out  The only negatives is probably that it gets busy at nightthey probably need to make it bigger.
Gross  Their tortilla soup tasted like vomit  After two spoons full I proceeded to throw up in the bathroom  NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN.
You're not going to be disappointed at Distrito that's for sure From the margaritas made with premium tequilas and fresh squeezed juices to the flavorful meats tacos and ceviches this place is a must go to for Mexican Food Being a native to AZ I'm super picky about where I'll good Mexican food and Distrito hits a home run in my opinion I also love the decor It's kitschy and classy It's such a fun restaurant I'm getting hungry writing this review.
I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me)  Yet this store is a foodie's dream There are aisles upon aisles of glorious wholesome products (pun intended)  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item  No joke  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical) I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's preystrategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation  Did I want a made-to-order wrap  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas (the live music was alluring)Maybe sushi  Pizza  Salad bar  Soup Maybe something from the smokehouseoooh A cupcake from the cupcake bar On and on it went My final decision was sushi The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp I also grabbed a container of ginger for $199--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger  Bliss  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser All in all a very satisfying meal Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store Then again it is Whole Foods A word of advise:  come with a game plan (eg a shopping list) If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.
well been going here for yearsstill go at least 2 or 3 times a monthmy youngest son is in the armyand ever time he is in town the first place he wants to go is rolando'sand the last place he goes when leaving town is rolandosalways the same carne asada burritode carne asada tacos are great toif and when you go hereand if you dont try it you losetry something carne asadaand if you do not like it i would have to say do not ever order carne asada any where because you just dont like carne asada yes it looks like a dumpbut guess what they made the deans list the last two times they went therech 5.
Two words: summer rates You can play at the best golf courses in town during the middle of the summer for mere pennies (if you can handle a little heat) The Phoenician golf course is spectacular and only around $35 in the summer Now I am not a seasoned golfer In fact I would barely call myself a newbie golfer I am slowly but surely trying to learn but my bf is a very seasoned golfer and he decided to take me to one of his favorite golf courses to help me learn the ropes of the swing Everything about the Phoenician golf course is high-end clean friendly and an overall nice experience Upon entering the golf facilities you have the option to visit Relish which is a delicious restaurant overlooking the first hole You can also order cocktails at the bar to take with you on the course The bathrooms are very nice as well and the pro shop is stocked full of binge purchases waiting for your wallet The driving range has plenty of spots and buckets of golf balls waiting to be hit I noticed a golf pro conducting lessons that looked appealing After taking a few practice shots we were on our way There are two courses one that goes through the dessert canyons and one that goes into the mountain more Both courses are lovely and have several water features nice views of Camelback Mountains and a nice outline that most any golfer would enjoy playing on Now I just have to get better at golf so I can play these nice courses in the nicer weather months.
Absolutely delicious food the employees are SO friendly & welcoming true genuine mediterranean meals The atmosphere is wonderful as well Service is consistently great I would definitely recommend Princess to anyone.
Nice coffee shop Didn't find it on Google Maps though.
I sadly had a similar experience to Kelly G  I have purchased several pairs of shoes from this store in the past and have referred friends as well as patients of mine here  I visited Suburban Sole on a Saturday and there were several "snow birds" in the store  I asked a clerk for help and she just told me to look at the front of the store for what I was looking for and went on to ask one of the other customers if she needed help  I am a small business owner and do my best to support other local businesses but have taken my business to the Shoe Mill in Tempe.
Eat here  I felt like a guest judge on Iron Chef  We were a private party of 12 or so in the small but modern "back" room  Service was great  Quick to bring yummy sake to start  Our group was served an expanded kaiseki menu  Four small japanese tapa-like apps The menu changes monthly so i'll spare you the details except that everything was wonderful  The waitresses kindly responded to my repeated questioning "what is in this" And they actually knew the answersThe appetizer courses were separated by a serving of sushi  By far the most bland pat of the meal  Then came a four foot long serving tray of shashimi and plates of robata grilled meat  The shasima was atop artfully melted ice blocks  Very "cool"Deserts were flavorful also  Nothing bad to say except bring a lot of moneyAmbiance: modern chic japanese but not tackyService: kind and promptFood:  fing awesome.
Bartenders Bob & Brian hands down is the best bar tenders in Phoenix Great happy hour prices and free pupu's on friday's.
I bought Biz In A Boxx twice  Once for my son and once for a friend's son  Both kids had incredible experiences with the product  My friends son has the middle level and actually started a business online buying and selling rare Lego pieces  He makes a transaction fee on each purchase and has made a small fortune.
We are so happy with the services they took care of a black alage problem that we had for years and no one else seemed to know how -looks great They have such amazing customer care the staff is so caring and trusting about not only the pool but for us as well.
So happy Naked Pizza chose Goodyear I am reviewing the food and service not parking The Pizza was excellent the delivery service was super-fast The crust (Original) was unique and very tasty The sauce was very natural tasting The toppings tasted fresh and unfrozen To compare the price and style of this Pizza to Domino's Pizza Hut or any of the big guys is unfair The bottom line is this: If you don't care at all what you shove down your throat get Domino's or Papa Johns Yes they are cheaper but there is a reason Kraft Macaroni and Cheese which is hardly even real food is cheaper than a fresh wild-caught salmon for example The bottom line is this: If you want a tasty fast and best of all healthy pizza get Naked If you don't care about what you put in your body get the big guys and keep eating HFCS Sugar Salt and Fat Did you know some pizza places have more than your entire daily value of sodium in just 1 or 2 slices of their pizza Their pizza might be cheaper but paying for your heart attack or stroke will most certainly eat up any savings.
The Sunday concerts in the park are chillin' Our group dons blinky lights and glow sticks and sits in chairs and on blankets on the far end of the park to the right of the stageThe park itself is well groomed and beautiful One of these days I will take the train ride around the park just becauseThe park is leashed dog-friendly Peekaboo experienced her first rabbit in the parkBring a blanket and a cooler and come join us for a Sunday evening in the park jammin' to some awesome tunes.
I figured there would be a bunch of college chicks drinking beer here There was not They had Left Hand Stout on draft which is alright Where the hell were all of the college girls I didn't get to creep any of them out.
The Stetson Chopped salad is something that has no equalIf you're from the Phoenix area or have visited a few times you've probably run into a similar chopped salad at other restaurants but Cowboy Ciao was actually the inventor of this yummy treat So you should definitely try it here first if you want the true AZ Stetson experienceI hate salmon With a passion In fact I hate most seafood But the smoked salmon in this salad is seriously delicious It doesnt even taste like salmon it's sweet slightly smoky and the texture is similar to a ripe tomato I know that sounds gross but I swear it's notI got my salad to-go before having a girls' night in with some friends and I ordered it about 5 minutes before I headed out the door to grab it To my shock and wonderment the salad was ready for me before I walked through the door even though the hostess told me it would 15-20 minutes Awesome The guys behind the bar were efficient with getting me my food eating utensils and taking care of my bill I was in and out in less than 5 minutesThe salad isn't as good when you're eating it from a box but it was still delectable The dressing to die for It's a pretty pricey restaurant (I think my salad was around $20 total after taxes and a $2 tip) but I was craving it so what could I do The only downside to the entire place is the lack of parking which in my opinion is a big turn-off for this entire area of Old Town But that obviously has nothing to do with Cowboy Ciao more so it's just a complaint for me to take up with the local mayor.
I have spent more hours here than I can count - and even if there were no traveling special exhibits I'd find something new every timeGranted - I am that person who spent over an hour staring at a single Kandinsky a few years back I do have real appreciation for the special exhibitionsI also appreciate the sculptures in the courtyard the miniatures the Asian collection and several other pieces from the permanent collection One of the advantages of being in Phoenix is the accessible parking (happily also along the light rail) and the reasonable entrance fees (To the people who gripe about the museum and theater prices in Phoenix - go to NYC San Francisco Boston Chicago etc We have bargains in comparisonHaving lived in PHX for as long as I have I've watched the museum grow Section by section I appreciate the modern lines and use of light throughout - and given how many additions have been built on over the years it's still architecturally coherentThe cafe is a nice pit stop and the gift shop is well stocked and has something for everyone There are great events through the course of the year - and annual membership is well worth the price for how much you get in exchange.
I am actually really disappointed in the service I got today I went in and was deciding what I wanted to get I saw that there was a chocolate moo'd and a peanut butter moo'd I asked if I could mix the two so I could share the drink with my girlfriend The girl answered: "Yeah they're both made of the same thing with different things in them" I'm still not sure what that means She then snapped at my girlfriend and didn't even ask us if we wanted a free boost It's a shame because I don't think we have ever had bad service at this establishment It's one reason we've returned consistently.
I had dinner last night for the first time at this place and I have to say that I really really liked it a lot  Upon entering the location I was impressed with how it was set up  Clean nice with lots of outdoor seating  The decor gave me a "fancy" feeling of dining yet without the menu sticker shock  Clean nice marble looking tables some booths and  a big beautiful mirror hung from one of the walls  Well decoratedAfter sitting down to eat with Gabi We were waited on almost immediately and the server was attentive and gave us time to think about our orders  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from and from what I could tell ALL the prices were relatively cheapI ended up eating the Gyro pita and I must say it was tasty and the portion was quite ample and large  I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around  I feel that you can't go wrong at this place from my experience  I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant along with the excellent food good sized portions wide menu variety and cheap prices.
DON'T get a Cabana at the pool here Not worth the $300 (doesn't include bottle service) and any drinks you buy is extra Which I was okay with actually However  the door guy is a complete Nazi  My friend had to get a room to get into the pool area (another 100 bucks) Older people a few ladies for hire "interesting" crowd to say the least I'll take my future  business to El Santo or Maia.
One of my long-time favorites  Love the pork burrito.
Came here when I was in Scottsdale for Spring Training We were craving Mexican food and this was the closest place to our hotel so Los Olivos it is The Chips and Salsa were brought to our table as soon as we sat down chips were very fresh thin and crispy They served the chips with 2 canister-type things of salsa They were both very good but I liked mixing the two it made for one damn good salsa My dad was in the drinking mood so he ordered a pitcher of Margaritas and man oh man that was a great way to get our meal started For dinner I ordered the Pollo a la Queso Crema a flour tortilla filled with chicken then fried and lastly topped with a seasoned cream cheese and melted cheeses This meal was phenomenal The seasoned cream cheese gave this just enough tanginess along with all the savory aspects the chicken has Thinking about this makes my mouth water and wonder if Los Olivos delivers to Northern CaliforniaNext year when I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop as soon as my plane lands and the last place I go before I head to the airport to come home AWESOME FOOD Good wait staff Wouldn't change a thing about this place.
Early on a hot Saturday morning we headed to Baker Nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure What a lovely nursery It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants We had so many questions and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant what kind of soil sunlight and water it needed etc I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house but I didn't know it's name so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch We loved the personal attention and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving Whether you're a seasoned gardener or newbie to the plant world your time won't be wasted at Baker Nursery and you'll get the best of the best in terms of plants and service.
Portillo's- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE Oh that's right Chicago I am so glad this amazing chain migrated its way to PHX They have so many different hotdogs hamburgers Italian sandwiches to choose from I got the Jumbo hotdog (minus the peppers-ew) and ate every bite of it I also got the cheese fries which I liked that they put the cheese on the side- that way the ooey gooey delicious cheese could be evenly distributed on each individual fry We actually had to get more fries so we could finish the cheese in it's entirety I warn you people if you go to Portillo's prepare to become an addict and wanting it all the time I plan on going back tonight.
Amazing  The classes are awesome the instructors great and it's worth every penny.
We had our work Christmas party here and they were SO accomodating  Trever goes out of his way to make sure the guests are happy  I can't wait to go back with relatives who are visiting for Christmas.
*Excellent variety * super clean store * well stocked * friendly people * Worth the trip     I had to find a party store and was at Banner Estrella Hospital  This Party City location came up in a search on my phone  I am not familiar with that part of town but easily found it   I was so pleased with how friendly and helpful everyone in the store was as soon as I walked in   They had a huge selection of themed party goods including candies that matched   Aisles and aisles of neatly stocked party goods gave me great ideas for both work related events and personal parties and entertaining   The manager Ed was the nicest guy and we chatted quite a bit   I read other reviews and don't know what they are talking about because this fantastic   I am very familiar with Party City and this was the most well stocked with huge variety and cleanest store I have seen   Prices are good - certainly no more expensive than other party stores While I was there 2 people came in for returns and they were handled without any problem  I heard the transactions - so I have no idea why someone said they didnt take returns    I will go out of my way to shop here even though it is quite far from my home   Thanks And I cant wait to visit at Halloween.
great food great prices and fasthave been going for 4 years   yummy .
We love Yogurtini  Our favorite flavors are the mint  chocolate & peanut butter  They have all the toppings you could imagine  I especially enjoy the mochi seriously tasty    The yogurt shop is located very close to yummy restraunts & lots of shopping so it is excellent choice for your desert destination.
Drinking water cause they got the pepsi  Food came out uncooked  slow service Server tried to tell me thats how it is  really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted  No visit from a manager or anything this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible  I won't be going back.
I would be giving this place no stars if I could I thought taking my car to a dealer would result in the highest quality work I was so wrong First their customer service is terrible I had to follow up over and over again over the 10 weeks that I dealt with them There were multiple instances of not getting called back not getting return emails not getting documentation emailed to me like I askedI could go on and on They did a very large amount of body work After having my vehicle for 35 weeks I finally got a call to pick it up About an hour after that call I received another call telling me they had failed to properly check the washer reservoir (which was damaged in the accident) and never replaced it I had to make another appointment to take the car in to have the reservoir installed (which they never called to tell me the part was in and again I had I follow up myself) When I took the car in the second time I repeatedly told them I was not happy with the way the good was fitting and asked at least 3 people to make sure they looked at the hood Upon picking it up the next day it came to find they never looked at the hood Too upset to even bring to their attention at that time I called and spoke to a manager the next week After taking the car in a third time it is finally fixed fairly well (they nicked the hood re-installing it which I will be calling about today) But even dealing with the manager I didn't get called about my vehicle for 5 days I guess that is what I get for dealing with a multi-billion dollar company that doesn't care about losing one customer Don't take your vehicle here It will only be a headache for you.
It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach but it's close  Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place   I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic though what there was of the filling was ok  beans  tasteless rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken Usually unless there's an attempt at "chefing" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands  very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck no returnOverall It feels like aliens space ones are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.
After passing this place on recent visits to Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy my girlfriend and I finally decided to give Wildfish a try in our efforts to collect the whole Waterfront set  We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night with reservations made on Opentable and were seated immediately with our choice of table or booth  My first impression of our corner booth was that it was a little TOO dark but no big deal  Our server arrived quickly gave us a choice of waters (I went with the standard hydrogen dioxide) and proceeded to be very pleasant and helpful throughout the evening  My gf had a glass of wine and we ordered the crabcake appetizer to which our server replied "Good choice That's my FAVORITE"  For entrees my gf went with scallops and I narrowed it down to swordfish or an Australian fish whose name i can't remember  I asked the server for her recommendation and she said the Aussie fish was her FAVORITE (2 for 2)  My fish came topped with crabmeat a rich buttery sauce and sliced grapes The acidity of the grapes provided a nice counterpoint to the sauce just as our server had promised  I also tried my gf's scallops and they were some of the best I've ever had  She agreed giving them a very slight edge over Olive & Ivy's  For dessert we decided to split a creme brulee which amazingly was ALSO our server's FAVORITE  Wow 3 for 3  What are the odds  Okay the first two I was willing to give her but when EVERYTHING i ordered was her FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU it started to feel a little disingenuous  Maybe tone it down a notch  Still I can't knock the service She did a great job and I'd rather have fake than surly any day  For 1 app 2 entrees 1 glass of wine and 1 dessert our tab topped out at $90  Not cheap but definitely reasonable for fresh seafood in the middle of a DESERT  Overall good experience and I'd say 45 stars  They get the lucky roundup to 5.
Best hidden secret on the valley  Nostalgia sweet treats fun flavors & a perfect garden to host kids parties  Extra points cuz they're pet friendly :).
I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit here The food was ok but the drinks made the night and so did our personable and skilled bartender who did an awesome job in serving teaching and entertaining us while our party of 3 sat at the bar waiting for our table  DRINKS:-I ordered the Persian-My friend ordered the  Citi-zen-Her friend ordered the Moscow Mule which by the way came served to her in a copper mug and a pickle:  the LEGIT WAY to serve any Moscow Mule (shout out to our bartender who informed us of this interesting fact)  My friend's drink was served to her in a martini glass However she asked our bartender to pour her drink into an old fashioned glass since she was a klutz when it came to drinking from martini glasses He willingly obliged but also joked around with the rest of us and asked what drinks we wanted AND what glassware we preferred our drinks in lmao Needless to say he made our drinks really well and really strong: our drinks were the perfect combination of preserving the integrity of the various flavors while packing a strong punch  When our table was called we sadly parted ways and what's worse I completely forgot to ask his name -_-The rest of my experience here was ok We were seated in the little room off of the main dining room I would've preferred to eat at the bar then eat in this small area because it felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant  FOOD:-I ordered the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich-my friend ordered the kale salad-her friend ordered the "original chopped salad' which apparently has its own Facebook page (click on the FB link located in the online menu on Citizen Public's website) My grilled halloumi cheese sandwich was definitely a frou frou version of the classic dish it was good but it was a bit disappointing only because I didn't know  this type of cheese doesn't melt and I was totally in the mood for some cheesy cheesiness My least favorite part of my dish was the bread it was just too thick tough to chew My friend's kale salad was a complete bust The kale was completely raw which was ok expect it was hardly dressed so alot of the bitterness was still there It was also hardly chopped so there were large pieces of raw and bitter kale to eat The "original chopped salad was the best dish out of everyone's Each ingredient used is arranged in neat rows and presented to you on a plate  The server then pours the dressing to your liking and proceeds to mix all the colorful ingredients and then serves it to you I'd definitely come back just to sit at the bar and try some more of their interesting cocktails chit chat with the super awesome bartender who assisted us during my 1st visit here and possibly try another food dish or stick to the chopped salad.
Why oh why do I keep giving Honey Bears a chance  We were about to go to Happs' for lunch and for some reason I suggested Honey Bears  Now Happs' is not great BBQ but I am still regretting my decision to skip them today  My coworker called Honey Bears an 85  85So what is wrong with Honey Bears  Well here it is in a nutshell: $11 for an extremely greasy pulled pork sandwich some beans and a bad fountain root beer  I opened my sandwich up no more than 30 seconds after it was wrapped and the entire bottom half of the bun was so soaked that half the meat came out during my futile attempt to pick it upThe beans well they were pretty good  I've already mentioned the root beer thoughOne of my coworkers got the sliders and they also had that soaked bun problem and not nearly as much meat as the picture depictedWhen a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears' they darn well better do a good job on each dish  If the food were reasonably priced I'd say it's the McDonald's of BBQ But you're paying almost as much as you'd pay at Famous Dave's without anywhere near the quality.
on vacation in scottsdale - and this place was incredible  it would stand up against the best restaurants in los angeles  the place is family style where everybody shares  you choose a few skewers and some main courses  can also get some sushi or some noodle appetizers  we got the miso cod and some sort of beef for the main courses and got a bunch of the skewers which were all incredible  the flavor of everything was just awesome  portions are tiny  i can't say enough about this place.
So my electric back hair shaver (aka MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver)  was on the fritz and boy was my back getting a little to "Robin William's" like and I couldn't stand it any longer  I had to get it fixedThis place can repair any type of shaving device add new blades or they even sell you a new one if neededThey also sell and repair small appliances vacuum cleaners coffee pots and blenders---Really I just come here to get the blade and foil replaced on my razor The location on Northern and the one on Central are both closed now.
You just can't get pizza like this  The taste and quality is top notch  Don't complain about the wait  They got a bar right next door with appetizers and drinks which makes the time fly by like your not even waiting  The system they have runs great they take very good care of all of their customers  Come relaxed and just enjoy the experience this place is easily one of the top 10 pizzerias in the country.
I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went inthat was a mistake  Now I go there whenever I can   Though while on the outside it looks like just a chain bagel place its way more than that  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYChonestly its that good     My faves:         **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for) a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese and a side of gravy THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona hands down          **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami corned beef and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye)  It has it all the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top.
Repaired my glasses for free Very friendly and customer service oriented Thank you.
I have stayed here since 1999 and I think it just gets better every time we come in to town Service is top notch the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view Nice quality mattresses linens and amenities The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us and when we decided to dine there they made reservations and printed a map Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening We are treated so well weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability we did not hear "no" with out a very valid reason and they came up with alternatives I highly recommend this place to relax and be pampered.
Where do I start  Canes sauceFreaking yummy  Texas ToastYUMMY  and the chicken so moist and juicy not greasy or or nasty  I cannot wait until the one on the West side of town is finished so we can eat it more often  Wish they had a few more options on the menu but in allmost of my family love chicken and fries  Thanks Canes.
Terrible Terrible  TerribleThe food here is absolutely horribleI wouldn't feed it to my worst enemyIt made me feel sick --   I definitely won't be back.
I have eaten at this amazing restaurant many times I take all my out of town guests here and they love it as much as I do We found this place by accident but it was an awesome discovery Don't let the name fool you They are apparently known for their desserts I have only gotten the banana cream pie It is so good I cant resist but get it every time Between myself my husband and our guests no one has had a bad meal My favorite restaurant in north Scottsdale I promise you wont be disappointed.
Purchased a Groupon deal for Fuego Del Mar while in Phoenix for this weekend but ended up here per the owner's suggestion as Del Mar is closed for a wedding reception The host is pleasant but our server is snooty and the taste of their food do not justify their pricing We're from CA and dined at places that charges this much but tasted way better than this We were in Albuquerque (El Pinto) and Santa Fe (Taberna La Boca) the weekend before and had excellent food but didn't pay this much.
Love their BLT and their pizzammmm  One of my favorite local pizza joints  Right there with The Parlor Bianco etcNever tried their breakfast but rumor has itit's good.
I am so happy this location opened up  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet.
Finding the address is easy (just follow 7th Street) finding the restaurant a little trickier as you have to drive past the entrance to the hotel first and not be tempted to nab one of the open parking spots - you've got a ways to go yet Keep ascending and eventually when your car has almost given out on you you'll find Different Point of View Valet was free and friendly Up one flight of stairs and you'll find yourself in the bar Up one more flight of stairs and you'll find the restaurantDécor is classy but a little dated Of course not many people will be looking at the furniture when they see the view A floor to ceiling glass window facing south with downtown Phoenix in the distance We were lucky enough to get one of the tables by the window as we had an earlier reservation (6:30) in order to see the sunset There is a patio outside which would be a great location to sit and watch the sun go down if only it wasn't 110 outsideThe wine list is very good and expansive There seems to be something for everyone from multiple thousand dollar bottles of Premier Cru Bordeauxs to more affordable domestic wines The only comment I would make is that there wasn't as much variety in the by-the-glass selectionIn addition the the regular menu they offer a three course prix fixe deal for $40  - select the options that are printed in red and the selections were surprisingly good The second prix fixe option is the Chef's choice seven course meal for $79pp with the option to add a wine pairing for an additional $29pp The table next to ours had the Chef's choice and it seemed to be a great deal We weren't that hungry and the OH wasn't drinking so we chose the 3-course menuFor apps the OH ordered the watermelon salad which was good but a little boring A slice of seared watermelon and some mustard greens or rape I ordered the lobster bisque and thought it was excellent but would have liked to have seen some lobster meat instead of everything being puréed It had a great flavourFor entrées I had the daily addition which tonight was Beef Short Ribs - delectable melt in your mouth amazing She ordered the Trout which was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of shrimp and enoki mushroomsDessert was Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee and Chocolate Turtle They were both good but the crème brulee was in a league of it's own You can see why it is their signature dessertService was very good and my water glass was never close to empty Luis was our server and he told us he had worked there for 11 years he said there were other servers who had worked there for much longer His service was very professional although a little pandering at timesSummary - This is a great place for a date night It's romantic the service is good the food very good and the view spectacular You should go.
Went there last night with a group Everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent We shared 5 different dishes The lamb masala was particularly good as was the tandoor chicken tikka  This is the best Indian food we have found in the valley (our group has been to many Indian restaurants in England Canada and elsewhere) The decor is a little plain but is clean and new.
Amazing Everything my wife and I had was fantastic Also our first time trying foie gras which is now my number one favorite food Highly recommend this place.
Jager my 6 year old bull terrier has been seeing Dr Allen since he was 10 weeks old She is nothing short of wonderful In fact the entire staff is comprised of the most compassionate people I've ever met and they truly care about my dog Over his 6 years mischievous Jager has gotten himself into some pretty precarious situations (run-ins with cacti frolicking in broken glass and of course  attempting to digest shoes and socks) The folks at Indian Bend Animal Hospital always make him good as new with as little pain (and expense) as possibleThe cost is much more reasonable than other similar facilities in the area As a full-time working single [dog] parent I really appreciate that they are open on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8 pm Dr Allen has always been patient even with an annoying first-time dog owner such as myself I can't imagine trusting his care to anyone else.
They do a great job  Staff is prompt friendly and helpful  I can get in touch whenever I need to - and it's all backed by a big-name company  I've know Tom for a long time and he is very knowledgeable when it comes to insurance matters.
Super friendly staff not expensive food Simple menu but delicious food Breakfast burrito is bomb Haven't checked it out yet but apparently they have a full bar too.
Taco Tuesdays are great and excellent prices A must go for taco Tuesday New favorite place.
great atmosphere.
After many hours of traveling to get from NYC to Arizona I was exhausted and starving All I had eaten all day was some crackers and it was the equivalent of past dinner time on the East Coast I was so happy when my family suggested we venture over to Sweet TomatoesFor those not familiar with the place this place has the largest salad bar you have ever seen It is literally the length of an entire NYC Avenue I always take 2 plates for the salad bar as I really don't like my food to touch They have excellent pre-made caesar salads asian chicken salads and joans brocoli I even tried a pineapple coconut cole slaw this time which was quite tastyI enjoyed making my own salad of lettuce cucumbers carrots raisins pasta hard boiled eggs and asian noodles They also have the best zesty italian dressing ever Afterwards you have choices of soups potatoes pastas and pizzas I had a sweet potato with honey butter It was the softest sweet potato and so sweet I have no idea how they cook it to such perfection The macaroni and cheese is also nice and creamyFor desert they have soft serve yogurt machines I had vanilla with caramel syrup The wait staff that comes to clear your plates is always super friendly and brings you fresh baked chocolate chip cookies I cant see how anyone could not love this place and I hope to come back at least 1 more time before my trip ends# Please bring Sweet Tomatoes to NYC .
DRINK COFFEE AT JOBOT (in robot voice)This is the coolest place you've never heard of Try a crepe they are ALL good however I recommend the ones w/nutella Staff is super laid back and friendly.
I really wish Va Bene was closer  The happy hour is amazing (try the eggplant dish) with great specials on food and drinks  I've had the vodka sauce pasta and that was pretty tasty but mainly I stick to the appetizers and drink specials  Luckily they have happy hour 5 days a week  The crowd is a bit older and they have karaoke after happy hour  If you're a 40something on the prowl watch out  Otherwise come earlier or sit in the dining room to avoid the cougars.
Well I have to say as a woman Not impressed I went to this "barbershop" which should've clued me in for the services I was going to be receiving I work with someones daughter who is the front desk girl who was really nice and had suggested this stylist They gave me a half off coupon (i hate that word) and one for a free haircut So I was like sweet I'll try it why not  Well needless to say it STILL cost me over $75 That's before tipThe stylist that they had suggested was really nice I was told she was very experienced and had done many hair shows before so maybe I was expecting to much Like I said she was very nice and when I told her  what haircut I wanted and how I wanted my hair dyed I thought I was in good hands I usually do an a-frame with blonde highlights Since I'm going on va-ca I wanted to spice it up a bit So I asked for a few pink streaks Needless to say the 3+ hrs I spent there was a total waste of time When she put the blonde on my hair I sat there not under a dryer because of course they didn't have one for almost 2 hrs By the time it was done my hair didn't look like it had been touched The pink pieces were ok it just kind of got on other pieces of hair It was really sloppy The haircut was just your run of the mill basic cost cutters Nothing special Kinda choppy When I left my hair was still wet and not styled When I got home and actually dried and straightened my hair I was so mad My gf suggested I call back and see if they could fix it SO I called the next day and the phone rang and rang and rang It went to voicemail SO I left a message I never got a call back so I called back a couple hours later When I called back I talked to the stylist and she told me that she had put the blonde highlights in and I could come back for more if I liked I asked her how much it would be (mistakenly thinking she would fix for free since I sat there for 2 hrs for NOTHING) and she said it would be $55 and since I was just there they would give me half off again Needless to say I didn't schedule I rather put my money to someone who is willing to keep my business.
Gastronomical yumminess  From a family that does not like Italian food.
Grew up on Mike and Rondas in Flagstaff  Its awesome to have one here where I live now    I cant really tell you about anything there but the Steak Strips with Eggs meal because thats all I ever get  I'm addicted to itI'm a simple guy that doesnt care for the frills just a place to sit a clean table and good service  If you want real food cooked with plenty of love this is your place to eat.
Colin M did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business so check out his review  I can only second what he said  This is a real camera shop stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishmentI have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendlyYou can find better prices on the internet but no instant gratification on the internet  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one  Who will repair or clean your camera for you  No we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more it's worth it.
This place is Fn amazing The boy took me here for my birthday dinner and literally I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at We went late 9pm rez It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace You seriously have to sit outside it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is Each table gets its own heat lamp too by the way We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing The mussels were delicious I LOVE mussels and ever since I left Boston I haven't had any good ones these were awesome I wanted more The Foie Gras was obviously delicious  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds For our entrees I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates We devoured everything and all of it was perfect Especially the bottle of wine we split with itTo wrap up the meal we got the crème brulee to share and as my photo shows they personalized it for my special day That along with 2 glasses of port and we were good to go Staff don't mess around they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet I will say this place is not cheap and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions however I will absolutely go back again and again and again birthday or not Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had period.
Love this place  Tell everyone about it  I've only gotten to go twice but have loved it both times  The staff is supper friendly and have gone out of their way to make sure we are taking care of without hovering or bugging us  I love how casual it is: order at the counter pick it up and take a seat  Last time my husband and i got our own dishes but this time we split a pulled pork sandwich with the potato salad side  Not a heavy meal but just enough: spent $8  I don't even like potato salad but have cravings for this amazing salad with a kick  Last time i had to take leftovers home and they didn't just put it in a box but properly wrapped itI'm fastidious about cleanliness and customer service and have hall all expectations exceededMy only complaint is that the bun of the sandwich is too thick but delicious  So i just don't eat the whole thing.
Love this theater  We go there all the time  We have the souvenier cups and loyalty shirt to get discounts on soda and popcorn.
This is a great place My fiance and I decided that if we lived anywhere close to Phoenix we would be there all the time probably almost every day Their website boasts 80+ beers 20 wines 3 sakes 10+ organic brews & wines and off-the-grid wine They live up to their boasting Keep in mind that she and I could be considered to be beer snobs crossed with beer adventurists The Lost Leaf filled our need for cool microbrews that we like a lot as well as cool stuff we had never had The bartender with very knowledgeable too which is always a plus in a place like this They have great art on the walls most of which I think is for sale They often have events going on as well When we were there a figure drawing event was happening They also have a poetry open mic live music a DJ and a bunch of other stuff It's definitely worth checking out.
First time to the mellow mushroom was very excited Took over an hour to get the pizza waitressed blamed the amount of people in the restaurant and how busy they were restaurant was maybe 20% occupancy Service was absolutely awful Pizza was okay but the service really killed it.
Awesome service and food  If you like that old world service and food this is the place for you Italian beef sandwich is fabulous plenty of meat and great bread  Menu has been changed recently but the food is still the same outstanding Please visit this establishment it's well worth the price and trip.
I'm long overdue for a review for this place - my favorite bar in Arizona As a craft beer fan (I try not to say "snob") I'm overwhelmed with a place with this good a selection of beers that I've never tried before or are worth trying again In addition to the ones they brew themselves (which are quite good) they also have a terrific selection of locals and from elsewhere on draft I get sample sizes when  I have the time a pint when I don't Happy hour is $6 for a pitcher (roughly 25 pints) for local Arizona brews I've been here for happy hours dinners and late drinks with friends and have had a quality experience every time To their credit for a craft beer place they have a decent selection of mixed drinks and some wines For food I've been pleased with chicken sandwiches (very tender) the Sunday all-you-can-eat bbq and appetizers The food is decent enough given that the focus is on the beer (in my opinion) Servers have been quite knowledgeable about the beers Atmosphere is kick-back casual with a bright interior with various types of places to sit - booths bar tables patio Patio is dog-friendly Parking can be tight but I've parked across the (rather busy) street (ie across Indian School) and it's not that big a deal  So far the only matches for beer selection are World of Beer (Tempe and Gilbert) Angel's Trumpet (which has no happy hour and the food is so-so at best) and 1702 (Tucson).
I will NEVER go to this restaurant again I was disappointed in every way by the food service & overall feel of this place  Sure they sat us almost immediately after we arrived however it wasn't til 10 minutes after being seated that we finally had to ASK for a waiter to visit our table When our waitress arrived she seemed lost & unprepared We asked for our bill to be split first thing (which later turned out to be "forgotten") Due to the fact that we were waiting 10 minutes just to SEE our waitress's face we ordered our food & drinks together to save time  As soon as she took our order it wasn't for another 30 minutes before we saw our waitress again & only after asking our bus-boy to find her The bus-boy brought us our burnt garlic bread & water but we didn't see any of our other ordered drinks for another 20 minutes After waiting the 30 minutes she came back to our table & tried to RE-VERIFY our food order Didn't you write it down Since we were in a pinch for time at this point we asked for our salads/soups to come out with our meals My friend had ordered the chicken ceasar salad as her meal so naturally when all the soups/salads were brought out we were expecting her meal Instead they had forgotten to add the chicken so the waitress took it back & apparently they had to start cooking my friends chicken for her salad because it took another 15 minutes to get HER salad  Really It's a salad people So the rest of us ate our meal while she watched since again we were all in a pinch for time Ridiculous I had ordered the chicken & sausage cacciatora & let me tell youit was probably the nastiest concoction I've ever eaten The dish was unrecognizable by its name It was lathered in tomato water yes water not even tomato paste or sauce It was watered down & tasteless The chicken was rubbery & the sausage was disgusting I tried my boyfriends lasagna which was less than mediocre I thought well maybe the salad would be better so when my friends salad finally came out I asked for a taste I mean how do you get a chicken ceasar wrong Well it was also quite revolting Overall the food was attrocious I made a comment to my friends that I'd rather throw the few bites of food up than have it sit in my stomachand it would probably look the same as it did when it first was set in front of me Yep it looked like vomit  I would NEVER refer anyone to this restaurant & would throw a word of caution to anyone who might be thinking of going I forgot to mention we met some friends there who were seated immediately as well but they had to ask for their waiter as well just to get some drinks Apparently they were so short handed that the manager had to bus their table Sad part is that they came in got seated & had their drinks before we did & it still took them around 20 minutes to be served Lucky for them they didn't order any of that slop Lets just say I would've been better off shoving my finger down my throat & yacking that sh** up rather than forcing my body to digest such swill When I first walked into the restaurant I was surprised at how nice it looked It was like getting a gift box with a pretty ribbon on it  You're so excited right Then when you open the box you find nothing but a steaming pile of sh** Disappointed Yeah so was I  No matter how pretty the box looks its still just a box of sh** Don't even get me started on prices in this joint  Makes ya feel like a total moron to walk into a place like that get served the way I was & still have to pay ridiculous prices for wretched food & service Too bad I'm an honest person otherwise I would've walked out without paying Nobody likes having to pay nearly $70 for food that came straight from the pigs trough My advice for the ownerfire your cook hire more competant staff & drop your prices I will be telling everyone I know & even some that I don't to NEVER go to this restaurant after my dinner service last night.
Can't really give a review on the food because they were out of chicken Went there on a Monday night not very late and they had only 1 piece of white meat chicken left no chicken strips and a few of the spicy chicken pieces left (we didn't want spicy)The staff wasn't overly friendly Not rude just not real friendly.
Great Pub  Good food cold beerreally enjoyed itgreat selection of beers on tap.
What a magnificent restaurant After four exceptional visits I decided it was time to show some love The food is a knockout the service is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef Let's talk food:1 Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever At $5 just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's2 Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description but they were crazy good My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful3 Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty I wanted more but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out4 Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin I thought I'd had great pork but I was sorely mistaken The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction That's all fine and good but nothing has ever come close to this I can't wait to go back to have this dish again5 Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever As a boy from Kentucky I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life but it absolutely ranked among the greats (Actually I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night) The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had Crazy addictive and strange Highly recommended6 Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed They were very good ribs but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering Although I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis7 Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens Praise8 Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun Just loved the balance flavors and textures Great salad to get for the table and shareThe thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know and they make it better than you thought it could ever be.
Excellent place Excellent Pizza really really good And the waiters are  all of them so so nice  The owner is frequently there asking if everything is allright  We have gone different days different seasons  always really great.
Yes yes and hell yes  The food--I had veal piccata the small portion--was delicious and more than enoughMy friend got the large size veal parmigiana and she had to take more than half home for the next day  Her portion was that large so maybe it is smarter to get the large order for a little more and get 2X the foodThey put bread that's toasted with garlic and olive oil on the table first which was dee-licious  Obviously I totally blew the Atkins all protein diet with that bread basket but it was sooo goodI just love the food here so this is now my new go-to place for real Italian ***Keep up the good work at this location but you need to kick the 83rd Ave location and get them cooking like the 59th Ave location  I've eaten at both and they just are not the same:  different cooks make a difference.
So we got off the plane checked into our hotel and walked over to Cowboy Ciao for dinner  I was expecting a bar/grill for some reason  But was pleasantly surprised at the upscale fine-dining atmostphereWife and I had the chopped salad  It was very good  I am lactose intolerant so the waitress held out the cheese  I have to say the reviews are right on with this one Delicious  I could totally eat a salad by myselfThen came the pork belly over waffles appetizer  Wow  I've always liked pork bellies being Asian I love fat  This is amazing  Salty smoky fatty deliciousness that melts in your mouth  The waffles just adds to the experience  It's rave in my mouth  :)For my main course I had the pastrami-style short ribs  Jeez  Wow  BIG plate with succulent juicy perfectly cooked short ribs  The meat is smoky tender and falls off the bones  So so goodDefinitely a must-eat in Scottsdale.
Never been here before You walk up and order It was fast The burgers were unexpectedly great and the 'Turtle Sundae' was off the charts Kids that work there are polite and smile Makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
My car was running rough leaking fluid and spewing smoke from the exhaust  I thought this would be major however they found the problem corrected it and the charge was minimal  I was astounded  Very honest  Will recommend to others.
When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hourwhich is the best HH food in town  Let me repeat that - best in town  Hamburger with truffle fries brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person Can't beat it  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tats  If you don't want the blaring heat of the brick oven don't sit at the corner next to itPhoenix is HOT enough in the summer so cool off and let someone else do the cooking.
Vienna Beef hot dogs best around and the stay is always the same always so realLove the place.
Lux is a weekend staple-- Saturday without Lux would be akin to missing a critical appendage  Well maybe not but pretty damn close As others have said the coffee is fantastic actually the best I've ever had  The espresso is always perfect  I have a weakness for their iced mochas-- really the only iced mochas I've ever liked Not too sweet not too bitter not too anything just pure awesomeness  And their whipped cream  It took me about a year of visiting Lux to discover this sweet surprise but it is so good  Still not sure what the special twist is but it is goooooood And their baked goods are better than any I've had at a coffee shop  Most are made on-site in an adorable little kitchen in the hallway  My love of baking tempts me to slip in tie on an apron and start baking- but I've held myself back from offering unsolicited help  At least thus far   The staff is always friendly and always remembers your name (or at least makes a concerted effort to do so) It's generally crowded-- which makes sense being as it is in my humble opinion the best coffee shop in Phoenix maybe Arizona maybe the US Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor ambiance and clientele suggests this but for some reason it still feels comfortable and friendly  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche whatever it is it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.
Poor service-small portions-pricey.
Well I just got back from Elmer's and again as always their Green Hot Beef Burrito or as I call ity was out of this world Here's a small little restaurant that the kids at Chandler high have been growing on for decades Whether it's a Burrito ( My Favorite) Taco or Machaca you' never be disappointed Filaberto's doesn't hold a candle to it and neither does any of the other chain slaughter houses in town.
Peter and his crew put out the best Chinese food in the valley.
Take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eating/drinking here  And for god's sake stay out of the bathrooms  Don't believe me check out the expert reviews on Maricopagov restaurant ratingspretty yuk.
The pizza is great and it's so original The price is good and the food is great But don't ask them for ranch it will highly offend them they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza The cheese is amazing.
As my first Yelp event in the Phoenix area my friend and I had a great time and were both VERY impressed with the eventFrom the moment arriving where we were greeted by Lindsey and then treated to four flavors of delicious gelato the first impression was a very positive one  We then saw english muffins being baked fresh in the "breakfast for dessert" area  We made some new friends in the cupcake area (where some Yelpers were decorating their own cupcakes) and shared a few of the desserts before checking out some of the other cakes and cookies (and getting the opportunity to suggest some new cookie ideas for LGO)  Then there were some drinks and water to wash down the delicious snacks  Add in plenty of fun conversations with other Yelpers and finally a great gift bag on the way out with pistachios cookies an english muffin  and some LGO bakery gift cards  While this was an amazing event I have always been a huge fan of LGO whether the bakery pizzeria gift shop gelato or coffee  Thanks to Yelp and LGO for a great evening.
1st time here came in 45 mins before they close but Krista was great about us staying until 7:20 to finish our cheese plate & prosecco She was willing to chat about cheese & their shop as long as we would engage her even though she had things to do for closingWe had the cheese board and Krista cheerfully replaced a newer Gouda with an aged Gouda we had enjoyed sampling She suggested the prosecco with our choices which was a great idea We had Ewephoria a sweet mild smooth sheep's milk Gouda Gorgonzola Picante a cow blue cheese and an aged Gouda we didn't take note of but it was butterscotch-y crystals throughout (yum) and very orangeThey do have a great selection of beers and wines olive oils jams etc and they have great product & offerings expansion ideas as the business profitsWE WILL BE BACK.
All of their food is great Servers always have an opinion on what you should try if you're indecisive and they're always spot on Bartenders are fun and always attentive but not too in-your-face Great place to catch dinner and/or drinks with friends or family.
This food is NOT MEXICAN everything is grease and nasty with no flavor This place is only good for drinking beer.
Good luck finding an actual Corp address to mail a complaint to I ended up writing a lengthy email complaint They claim they will respond within 24hrs we shall see I will update *if* they respond.
Never again  This place is the worst  They didn't even vacuum the trunk  Bring back the illegals americans are too lazy and stupid to even wash a car.
We used to go to Carolina's regularly but after reading reviews on Juan's I thought I would give them a try Have never gone back to Carolina's The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap Their nachos with guac and machaca are the best I have ever had The service is quick and I always feel at home there I try to go once a week and I never walked out disappointed  For me that's great atmosphere They sure sodas in huge glasses as is their generous portionsTheir green corn tamales are the best as is their green enchilada sauce Also a favorite are their cheese crisps machaca enchilada and ground beef tacos Try their sopapillas for desert.
Great place to take salsa dancing lessons Very basic fun and you don't even have to have a dance partner.
The fact this place is never open during the weekend is bizarre for a bakery Also the fact that I cant even go in before 8 am weekdays is even more bizarre to me I used to work at safeway bakery and they were workin from 11pm-7pm the next day So the fact this place is not open before 8am or after 5 is quite bothersome so i will never be able to see if this place is even decent.
I would have never chosen to go here but my buddy made me go He was looking for an old Western Town and his parents went here years ago  I hated to tell him that there was no mechanical bull back in 1888 When we got here there were families celebrating birthdays with kids and large groups of people coming in on tourist buses It was kind of like a tourist trap The musical act on stage was uninspiredseemed like they were just playing their music set taking long breaks and collecting there check The food was okayan Outback Steakhouse would have tasted better My drink came in a cracked glasshow does a bartender not see that before they pour a drink Answer: Someone who is bad at there job and collecting there check The fun parts of the evening:  the Rattlesnake we had for dinner It tasted like Calamari And the actors in the old western town  They were in character and it was funny to have conversations with them It reminded me of that episode of South Parkwhen the boys went on the field trip to an old western townI think the creators of the show might have come here for research If I had kids I would go back here because it would be fun for them  I would not go here for the food.
one word:  awesome.
Pizza Bianco has the best wood fired pizzas  The wise guy and bianco verde are a great combo  Make sure to add mushrooms to the wise guy for a taste sensation.
Oh Cowboy Ciaohow I miss thee It doesn't better than a Stetson Chopped and a glass of wine Oh and the mushroom pan fry and desserts aren't bad either.
Just purchased a used BMW R1200C and was appalled at the dealership prices for regular maintenance services and began looking for a small private bike shop  Was referred to Josiah the owner of Dirtball by a fellow BMW enthusiast  Josiah is BMW certified + works on all other types of bikes  He's fair friendly and VERY reasonably priced  I needed a couple new tires and he ordered them in for me on my word and the price was the same as any super cheap no overhead online motorcyclesuperstore type etailer  He charged a fraction of the cost for install and then even test drove the bike for his opinion on it mechanically he found a loose tail light  He also adjusted my shock to my height/weight  He didn't charge me for the test drive shock adjustment or the tail light tightening  I spend some time in the shop watching him work on my bike and could tell he's very careful with all of his customer's babies  He had several folks drop in and drop off big expensive bikes of all flavors all so relieved to have found him  Josiah is honest knowledgeable and and affordable I highly recommend him.
Garlic knots Need I say more Not only are their pizza and salads amazing but they have the best garlic knots I've ever had Even if you just go in there for dessert it doesn't get much better than the Zeppolis The prices are great - and you can get a single slice of pizza or a whole pizza this place is 10 times better than Domino's Pizza Hut or any other delivery pizza place Get the garlic knots i'm not sure if I forgot to mention it but they're amazing.
Best Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion perfect flavoring and al dente AMAZING The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit) Our server didn't even know what it was What i know.
THE best salsa I've had in a while and great crispy chips  Our waitress Laurie was attentive and food arrived hot and fast  I had the Chicken Pibil Tacos (in honor of the Taco Festival in Scottsdale this weekend) and loved them  A focus of Manuel's seems to be on customer service and it shows  Great place for lunch-will be trying out the dinner menu soon.
As good a steakhouse as there is Proof that money does buy you the finer things in life This place is on the steep end of the price scale But you know that coming into it The food and service is primeNote: Place is very dark and the noise level can be tremendously loud.
Excellent pizza but make sure you get a whole pizza  In other words if you want their best pizza don't order it by the slice I got into the habit of getting a slice or two after I work out at the gym and the slices were just ok That was because they heated up the slices from a pizza they made earlier  But one weekend I ordered a large freshly made pie and what a difference Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had  I've been going to NYPD since they opened and the staff has recently changed (within the last year or so)  The original staff I all knew by name are long gone They'd throw in a free soda quite often but after checking with the newer employees a lot of the original ones were let go for giving out freebies  Too bad A little hospitality goes a long way in my opinion.
Absolutely fantastic Our small business conference group were treated like kings Food was perfect From appetizers to Desserts I wish all Flemings were this great :).
Really good drinks and good food Very fun place to go out and hang out.
You get what you pay for and at Simply Bread it's worth the price I recommend the challah and the fabulous macaroons I bought a macaroon on a whim one morning after hiking at South Mountain and almost turned the car around to buy 100 more when I bit into it on the way homeMy only saving grace (for my wallet and my waist) is that I'm always at work during their business hours.
I happened upon Aloha Kitchen on my last visit to Phoenix The food was authentic and perfect I grew up in Hawaii and was transported back to the islands and my childhood On my fortieth birthday it was the perfect evening The saimin char sui bao and the teriyaki chicken were great I wouldn't recommend the haupia pie as authentic which is a good thing for the locals When done exceptionally well it is addictive I will eat here during each and every visit to the area.
If there is ever any place to be for dinner this is it Sometimes I find myself dreaming of brie and steak tenderloins on thoes little toasts Great beer and wine selection Can be hard to get there for happy hours because it's packed The service 4 stars Highly recommended :).
We usually really like this restaurant but DO NOT order the street taco appetizer For $995 you get 4 mini corn tortilla with 1 or 2 matchstick size pieces of steak in fact one taco only had one matchstick piece If you go here for lunch stick to the burgers or Pizzas.
Awesome paletas you can ask my son lol.
We go here a lot for their incredible happy hour And we drive 30 miles to get there too - that's how much we like it Awesome large martinis for $5 the happy hour menu has great selections Get the happy hour salad and split it It's more than enough for two The oysters (big and extremely good) are just one dollar during happy hour A very classy Scottsdale restaurant I probably been to this restaurant six times in the past few months - I've never been disappointed (except when they didn't have any $1 oysters).
This place reminds me of the many breakfast joints I miss in the Chicago area Good basic food Plenty of it Super low prices Down-home informal good stuff Don't get me wrong If you're looking for organic and upscale you're headed for La Grande Orange or True Food ($$$) If you want the best tasting breakfast you've ever had you're going to Matt's Big Breakfast ($$) If you want a place to eat every week (or more) that's good filling inexpensive and convenient for meeting with people it's Fast Eddie's Joe's Diner or Acacia Cafe.
Nice staff Great sandwiches Great coffee and drinks Free wifi and great hours 6am to 9pm or 11pm (Fri & Sat) Nice local feel.
My husband and I went here for a date night and it was the best date night ever I have been to one other reflexology place and this one is by far so much superior The therapist I had was amazingworking every part of the body Even though you are fully clothed you don't feel like the massage is compromised in any way We were both so relaxed by the end The scalp and foot massages are excellent And then they put a nice hot pack under your neck to continue soothing the muscles You can't been an hour's massage for only $30 and $55 for a couple I will definitely be back.
I've been fortunate enough to be coming to Cibo since the family did their own opening Wonderful pizza I always have to get the antipasto platter for those amazing balsamic onions Great beer & wine selection.
Wow this dinner was pretty spectacular I've never had an experience quite like it So you start with a lovely salad bar they had butter lettuce (yessss) and a delicious basil dressing that went great with my tomato slices There were also a variety of cheeses available and smoked salmon yumNow lets get down to the meat There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous Filet Mignon Beef Ancho Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese) Frango chicken wrapped in baconyay Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite Cordeiro the leg of lamb moist and deliciousThis is a great concept for a restaurant I can't wait to bring my husband for his birthday.
Great Persian restaurant  Tasty rich food great friendly service and nice decor  What else can you ask for  Try their combination plattersall meats have great flavors tender and well presented  When it says it serves 2 people there are actually enough food for 3-4  Don't forget to save room for desserts  Persian (rose water) ice cream with baklava is my personal favorite  It also looks like they give you a free dessert for your birthday.
This is a great hotel and extremely pleased Stayed during a previous visit  though I am no rating it on hotel ranking convention the service and rooms are well worth the money.
No wifi Are you kidding me ur a cafe for god sakes Won't be going back until wifi is added.
took my mom grandma and the mrs here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experiencealthough the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star first up came the bread and olive oil and when we asked for butter we were denied because they didn't have any what restaurant doesn't have butter we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad both were superb the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right we went with two pizzas a red and a white the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni and it's not on the online menu) the white pizza was definitely  my favorite as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect we couldn't leave without desert and settled on the nutella and fresca both were to die for i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella oh how i heart your pizza cibo no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo you treat me and my taste buds perfectly.
I Love Downtown Phoenix Why Well it's has lots to offer from Mexican food to Italian food The shopping is great (I love the modern bohemian charming Charlie and JoS Bank) the recently opened hotel palomar was also a great added bonus with a pool and bar And soon there will be apartments built next to the palomar hotel Can't wait.
I don't get these reviews For $816 I got two nice-sized cupcakes made from cake mixes For that price I expect to get home-made cakes from quality "scratch" ingredients For $816 I could buy a couple of cake mixes and frosting ingredients and make about 30 cupcakes And don't say buttercream frosting when it's made from crisco (sweetex) Yuck Where have all the tastebuds gone.
So there is this amazing pizza place called Pizza Press outside of Disneyland It is one of my must haves when I visit Imagine my joy when I walked into Fired Pie with the same concept and deliciousness but without the almost 400 mile driveThe toppings are fresh and choices are plentiful so even the picky eater can find something The reg tomato pizza sauce isnt spicy and it isn't sweet ( if I want sweet I will buy dessert) The only thing is to tell them is to not over cook the pizza cuz it can easily get charred If you arent a pizza person or need more than just pizza the salads aren't to be missed I ordered just a plain ceasar salad and it was awesome  The lettuce was crisp and fresh They didn't overpower it with either cheese or dressing It wasn't premade and dumped in a bowl or packaging to just serve up Another plus is that it is definitely big enough to share if you are with someone and you are each having a pizzaAll said and done this is a place that I hope stays in the neighborhood for years to come.
After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour invited us back and more than made it right  We knew they had great food and now thanks to Charles we know they have great management  We highly recommend it.
First offit is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there which is annoying My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spokethere was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later apptand the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctorshe didn't even tell us her nameshe didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the worknot to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks She didn't say much and didn't really do anything I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here as of now I just called to schedule another apptalso not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back againso as of now I called in to schedule another check up they open at 8 Yeah I'm pretty sure  Ring Ring no answercall againring ring no answer called 4 times and no answer No they were not busy it rang for a long time I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics.
We have been going here for about 3 years now  Everything from the food to the service is great every time  Our favorites are the orange beef sesame chicken generals chicken and their potstickers are amazing  The employees build a relationship with their customers and it's nice knowing we can walk into a restaurant and they know what we want and we know we'll be treated well.
This place is cute but that's about it Everything is made from cake mixes nothing is from scratch not even the frosting Ew You're better off going to safeways bakery than here to be honestIt's overpriced & poor quality boring tastes and really they only have cakesI'm a pastry chef so I like to think I know what I'm talking about ].
I honestly love the Clarendon Hotel I celebrated my birthday here with some friends and family and had a blast (from what I remember) The rooms are awesome classy and interesting The window treatments are unique and consist of an almost industrial looking sliding window cover I noticed that the wall art which I can only describe as uniquely edited Arizona scenic photography became a conversation piece by everyone who came in The beds are extremely comfortable like sleeping on a cloud and you better believe we rocked the comfy white robes too The bathroom design is very modern and the only thing I didn't like was that the bathtub was pretty small which makes it hard to have bubble baths :) We took advantage of the mini fridge which we were excited had a freezer The hotel provides bags of ice too which I liked better than having to go back and forth to an ice machine The ice did leak into the fridge though soaking my cake in water but I forgive them for that They had FREE snacks that you could get a the front desk if you just ask and they have some good choices like goldfish kit kats m&m's just to name a few Some of my guests also grabbed some food from Gallo Blanco and all of it tasted really good I have no idea what I tried so I can't give a valid review of the food They have a cool hallway with the history of the hotel and its connections with some crazy mob gangs I recommend you take a look  The rooftop baroh how the view is amazing I was surprised that it wasn't packed on a weekend night but happily surprised because it felt like I had my own private rooftop event There are bartenders up there but we had our own supply in the room so we would just go back and forth from the room to the roof all night We had so much fun or TOO much fun I know this because me and the fiance didn't make it out to the bars lol We don't really remember but we had a little too much to drink and our friends made a decision that we should call it a night LOL We woke up a little late and the front desk called they were nice enough to let us check out late The pool is gorgeous and awesome Our friends enjoyed it plenty while we suffered with a nasty hangover :) Good times.
This is the best place for accessories ever  It is also good for those with OCD as everything is color coded.
Tonight's Bistro Steak and Panzanella Salad was DIVINE  Nova did an EXCELLENT job as the meat was so tender and flavorful  The salad had a perfect amount of dressing and the homemade croutons were browned to perfection  It was heavenlyAGAIN.
The staff is super nice They are quick too If there is a line drive - thru line I suggest getting out and ordering from the walk up window They will get your order done with lightening speed Carmelizer FTW.
Trust me I worked at a Chinese take out place before and this rice here is stale and day old because fresh rice does not look off white and is not so hard  Spring rolls when fried once are light brown in appearance but refried ones that were not sold the day before and thrown back into the deep fryer turns the edges dark brown and greasy  Some folks might try to say the oil is just darker but darker oil in the fryer means its not been cleaned and changed regularly enough that its gotten to a gunky black color  It's a troublesome process and it is true that most places do not do it often enough but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your foodThe chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce  Overly starched and overly salted  Does not have any flavor at all  If this is NY style Chinese food then its not the NYC I have been to  My friend had their teriyaki chicken and its bad too : (  Same stale rice with pieces of oversauced chicken  He said after it tasted kind of weird not the teriyaki taste he was expecting  Again too much starch and salt  And this is the dude that eats everything Dear fellow yelpers stop short changing yourself  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food  Neither does big shrimp crisp cabbage in egg rolls big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food  Guys U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price that's perfectly fine too send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet seafood or no seafood  But please do not rate this place as 5 stars because a 2 star is generous  I gave them 2 cause the service is good and they keep the place pretty clean and neat  I think I am too generous already.
Do makeup for a living and over time started to realize I was spending more time filling in my brows than anything else due to over waxing and plucking through out the years  Finally decided to grow them out not touching for the last 4 months  Hardest thing I have done other than quitting smoking  So here I am with overly grown out brows and lots of explanations to my clients as to why I look like Chewbacca  Very proud of my accomplishment and don't want just anyone to shape them and screw up all of this hard work  Found Laura on Yelp and figured with this many 5 star reviews she is the one and she was Great location clean and she listened and shaped them to my desire  I absolutely love them and finally feel human again  She is very reasonably priced and also includes tinting so I can afford to see her every 4-6 weeks I don't normally write reviews but she was so great I just had to get the word out.
Best Place to watch UFC for free Best place to watch regular season games due to the many Tv's if its on TV they got it Best place for 2 and 3 dollar beers Appetizers are always half off You can even request games on the Tv' near you Ive been coming here for 4 years and love itAnyone that doesn't like this place is a moron or a snob plain and simple.
I've been here a couple of times and I recieved great service everytime I give this five stars for a combination of things  Food is great the waiters are helpful yet not pushy like other places that come around so often you can't even enjoy your meal  great place for dinner  you might want to make a reservation depending on the night though.
"Kismet: (Islam) the will of Allah - kismat An event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future - destiny fate" That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very very happy We met around 7pm at Cibo We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs I ordered the Bruschetta it was delicious The entire table enjoyed that appetizer Once the main meals arrived we realized that appetizers weren't needed For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy/smoky bite out of it There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality I was amazed At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepeheaven Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing To finish our dining experience off we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur Of course from start to finish I was happy Our service was spot on the food was FANTASTIC and the drinks were wonderful It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then right there I honestly do not have one complaint one criticism one bad thing to say about Cibo I hope to catch a moment of kismet again.
I love this place so much  What the hell is going on  Sign did change for a hot minute this year  But now the sign is back to Asi Es La Vida and the doors are chained and the phone number doesn't workWTF  my favorite restaurant  Please someone tell me they're remodeling and not closed  WHAT'S THE SCOOP.
I love this place I can't think of a better place to eat pizza in the valley take that Pizzeria Bianco  All of the pizza is great and the place has a great vibe  If you are a fan of LGO and the Vig this is your place  Try the mushroom or pepperoni pizza I do have a word of warning be careful when you make your own pizza since before i knew it i had made a $25 12 inch pizza but that was because i misread the menu opps.
This is a Troon Golf - golf course and it is an experience  It is not for the faint of heart 7517 yards from the tips this course is fun challenging and will test your bunker skills but it is a great course and it is well kept like most of Troon's courses throughout the valley  The staff is exceptional the practice areas are excellent fees are not outrageous and are well worth the price  Make the drive and enjoy this gemOh and ladies - don't be intimidated this is a great course  I am not an outstanding golfer but I do love the game and changing it up  Give this course a shot and you will not be disappointedFrom the Southern Dunes website"In creating the golf course at Southern Dunes Golf Club the highly respected Scottsdale-based golf design firm of Schmidt-Curley Design Inc teamed with PGA Tour star Fred Couples Southern Dunes was the sixth collaboration between Schmidt-Curley and Fred Couples following The Plantation and The Palms in the Palm Springs area Southern Oaks Country Club in Houston Talega in San Clemente California and The Crosby Estate in Rancho Santa Fe California"I have played this course 3 times now since moving here last summer and I will be playing it many more.
This isn't a fancy place but the food I had was delish  I had fish tacos because that is my favorite Mexican food to try at new eateries I was not disappointed  The prices are reasonable and the place was clean.
Been driving by this place for a few years on our way to/from Lost Dutchman State Park and always noticed LOTS of cars  pickup tooout front  We took a chance that night and what a surprise  Great place  Good ole cowboy bar/restaurant w/dance floor and band  We had the chicken and it was the best I've ever had  We paid extra to get another breast but it turned out they were so big that I took it home  My husand ordered the shrimp & chicken and they gave him an order of chicken & ribs by mistake  They promptly replaced it  butwe made a big mistake  We are not "rib people" but they looked super good and he was sorry he didn't keep the "mistake"  Served with potato wedges cole slaw & buiscuit   Shrimp was so/so   Really good plus the wait staff is very friendly and fast service  We will definitely go theyre next visit.
After my favorite wings place closed down (NY boyz subs n wings) I tried the next winner of the Wingstock challenge It's a little bit out of the way for me but it was well worth the trip there The chicken is incredibly crispy and juicy the mac and cheese bites are amazing The jalepeno poppers were my least favorite (honestly Jack in the box does it better) but the size of the jalepenos are hefty and well worth the priceThe honey biscuits are the BEST if I were to come back here again I would come back for the honey biscuits rater than the wings It was soft sweet hot and delicious It's a little bit on the expensive end but it's a good alternative from places like hooters.
While this place has great food it is the WORST customer service I have ever seen Total disorganization during busy times they ignore you when you're standing in line to pick up food and in general have no clue how to handle a busy restaurant Chef Ramsey would have a heart attackThe food is not good enough for me to stand in line an hour to pick up a called in order only to be told it wasn't ready yet and they didn't know when it would beLost a customer.
The food here is extremely good and the service has always been impeccable  The one time something came out that was sub par the waitress apologized profusely and removed it from the bill  Once they also accidentally brought the wrong pizza but quickly corrected it and comped it  Great atmosphere and no snobbery Fast friendly service at lunch time.
Amazing choices Friendly staff.
Came here because of a bad experience at florindinos ( I should have known better) the food here is always amazing  The staff is very attentive and the place was packed (it's almost 2pm on a Wednesday) my server was busy with larger parties but my drink was never empty (Araceli) I've never had a bad experience here.
One of my favorite Art Galleries on Roosevelt Row a mandatory monthly stop for me.
I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts)  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies  This place deserves a thumbs-down unless you love Americanized Asian  The food was bland breaded and just not worth any money  Next time I'm in Phoenix I definitely won't eat here.
I've rented from this Uhaul 3 times It is fast and affordable and they don't try and upsel you a bunch of crap you don't need Mike has been here a long time and he is very helpful and friendly.
First time to Pita Jungle we loved it it was late and it was packed But where there is great food you should always find a crowd The portions were enormous even the appetizers which makes it great to share with a small groupthe atmosphere was a lot cooler than i expected being from out of town The artwork on the walls really caught my eye and gave me a lot to look at-which made the time fly while waiting on our order which was perfect timing didn't take long at all The pricing was great and the selections on the menu made it so hard to decide what to get but everyone one was extremely satisfied with their meals Wait staff was quick and friendly Wish we had one of these at home - definitely leaves you full and not guilty since you are eating pretty healthy here.
great selection but the shopping center can get crowded at peak times.
We were going to the movies today and did a Yelp search for resturants This place was at the top of the list and for good reason Its fantasitc Apon entering i was taken by the great decor and cleaness We ordered Spicy Edemime and Potstickers to start off Then i got the Arizona Sushi Roll and my wife got a noodle dish We will back Loved it.
Mediocre   Overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money  I order the house special chicken & sweet & sour chicken with 3 PC egg roll  First disappointment was you can't purchase just one egg roll you have to purchase 3 @ 395 then if you want to upgrade to fried rice it's $6 that's crazy  So I passed on that I went to go pick up As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls  1 box of house special chicken  1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice  One box for both entrees we got one small box  I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $2700 won't be returning.
This is the most moving and inspiring museum I have ever been to You get to travel around the world and experience music and dance like never before  Being able to simply walk up to an exhibit without having to press a button on the headphones made the experience even more joyful  You need more than one day to truly experience all this place has to offer I wanted to listen to every snippet of song but it is overwhelming and I will simply have to come  back again and again If you are a fan of music and dance get ready to have your heart opened and your soul bathed in the beauty that all of humanity shares through their unique song and dance This is also a magnificent lesson in geographyUnique inspiring and truly a destination museum  If you have one day only to see museums in Phoenix do NOT miss this One of a kind.
We just moved to Mesa and received one of those door hanger thingy's advertising this place We ordered the philly cheese steak pizza and it was amaaaaaazingIt was delivered to us on time and was really reasonably pricedWe can't wait to order from them again (and try a different pizza each time).
Now that I've recovered from my food coma I can happily report on my pleasant experience at Beckett's Table As our large group walked in we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia you would never know once you get situated inside We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire Tasty It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it So now moving on to the food Order everything on the menu or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious The enchiladas have a zing to them the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone I moved to the entree Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go Yes it was worth every bite and more The shorts ribs were so tender the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment To end the meal marathon the group tasted all the desserts on the menu Yes all of them Each one was good in its own way but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake What can I say I'm a chocoholic In summary this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphereLet me also might addthey are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.
Absolutely our fave place to go for Mexican food Out of all the mexican restaurants we have eaten at their salsa is THE BEST (love the hot and the mild) We have eaten there 30+ times and have only had bad service a few times Cant go wrong here.
I have been with Paul Demos for more than 8 years and he has been the best financial planning and tax person I have ever had I am 75 years old travelled the world as a computer consultant and his expertise is the best I trust him with my money and his recommendations have been right on the mark I now own a glass studio and a jewelry studio where I create art objects and he has been a very important contributor to my ideas bank and he has saved me from an IRS audit 3 years ago The audit proved we were right and the IRS was wrong Can't go wrong with PaulAl Stahlberg.
Was in Arizona this past week and hit up Pho Nhat still AWESOME The #17 is the best can't wait to go back in a few months.
GO HERE Seriously just go Stop reading this review and go eat some tacos because I don't want this place to shut down It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot Granted it's new and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood (Watch everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table)Their margaritas are perfect and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly  Love their beans so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in got 2 margaritas 5 tacos chips and salsa and a side of rice and beans for $15  Such a steal.
This is one of my favorite places to get what I think is the best Prime Rib in the valley The service is always very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is lends itself perfectly to couples looking for a little romance Everything is a bit pricey but worth every penny When you order Prime Rib you get a salad and a choice of two sides Plus their spinach dip is awesome.
Myself daughter & husband (when not working) go every other Friday no matter what  The place is spotless  Amy Ken and all the employees always treat us like family and call us by our first names Selection of polish is fantastic just when we think we have tried every color polish new ones appear If you have had a bad experiences or never had your nails or toes done treat yourself and you will become a regular just like us  Ken's is the Nordstrom's of the nail industry  Ken and Amy you are the best that is why you have the best employees.
So disappointed  I used to love BJs restaurant  Their food is no longer the great delicious quality that it used to be  It was as if they received frozen prepared food in a box microwaved it and served it  Everything we ordered tasted stale or like a cheap thawed out frozen dinner  Our waiter offered no resolution whatsoever and had a "so sad too bad" attitude stating that corporate changed some of their recipes and they had no control over it  He also charged us full price for everything even though we ordered happy hour specials We had to remind him that it was happy hour  Never going back.
I usually don't like Pizza hut pizza but today my son wanted pizza and since R&R shut down (like everything else in Queen Creek or un-incorporated Pinal County as they like to call it)  we made our way to this Pizza HutI must say the Pizza was yummy and the service was top notch  It was sad for lunch time and I am talking right in the middle of lunch time (12:30) it was dead  the only other people in the place were some people interviewing for a job there  I had to laugh at that too because when I walked by the question was "how are you with a fast pace working environment"  I thought not much fast paced about this Pizza Hut  Anyway I hope they are able to stay in businessThe service was really good and the lady went above and beyond to make me and my boys happy (and they are loud)  The dessert pizza was good they had a good selection at the buffet and even brought me the kind of pizza I asked for when it was ready  How about that for serviceits a buffet but I still didn't have to serve myselfha.
All Waldorf AstoriaMy wife and I stay here 4-5 times a year and have never had a problem Everyone is so nice Frank and Alberts is excellent We have a great time on the putting greengreat times.
This is an update to my previous nightmare with Safeway Home DeliveryI received what you may consider a Make-shift receipt with only information  typed into the body of an email Safeway was kind enough to type in the date of the transaction along with the total tax fuel surcharge and delivery charges   The printout was good enough for me to submit for reimbursement so at this point that's all that countsHowever I am not amused or impressed by Safeway in the least   15 days after placing an order is way to long to have to fight with a monster grocery store chain who should know betterI have no plans on being a repeat customer.
After hearing all the hype about bareMinerals makeup I finally went to go nose around and see what the deal was I stopped in to the little shop in Fashion Square drawn in by all of the pretty makeup and soft lighting of the shop (marketing at it's finest folks) and ended up getting my makeup done WOW You really don't understand what a difference it makes until you look at your face before and aftercrazyKai was the girl doing my makeup sweet girl who was really good at explaining everything about the makeup as she fixed my face And as she did it she explained the techniques so I could duplicate the look at homeNow granted I will never reveal to my husband how much money I spent on this new face of mineBut I will tell you that it is worth every penny The very next day my clients were shocked by how much different I looked Those compliments were enough to erase the dent in my wallet.
The look and feel of this place is amazing you have yo check it out With good prices on drinks and a hot friendly staff how can you go wrong.
The BEST veggie pizza I have ever has in my life I'm not a vegetarian The flavor is nice and strong not wimpy like most Teen son tried it & asked to keep the rest of the slice - crazy good for anyone His black bean quesadilla & side salad was delicious & neither of us love black beans Our service was great red haired younger woman very friendly & helpful Great world music playing LOVED IT We felt energized by the good quality food environment & company  Wish they were closer to usNo it's not cheap - but that quality of ingredients isn't cheap for them to buy.
Phoenix is big but so is the reward you'll earn by getting across it to My Mother's You'll enter a homey-decorated time machine back to when food and drink were generous and scrumptious and service was authentic and personable In the latter function look for Teresa who presented our chicken-themed dinner entrees --- chicken tenders chicken-fried steak and chicken-fried chicken --- with ample sassy conversation And how about that fresh-most salad bar and the potent margaritas We were lucky enough to catch Mother herself on a rare visit from her place of retirement but once you've visited the place your return visits won't be rare at all.
Lizz just gets it  She knows exactly how to cut and manage my crazy curls and helps me incorporate enough 'edge' to feel current but not out of my comfort zone  Liz has been working her magic on my hair for almost 10 years and every single time I feel like a million bucks  But it gets better  Not only is her technical skill fantastic Lizz is truly one of the nicest people I know  Not to mention a fashion goddess  5 very enthusiastic stars for this wonderful woman and stylist.
The only thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good hot food tons of flavor and excellent service I always sit at the bar.
I took my 2 year old queensland heeler in to be spayed this weekend and didn't really know what to expect as this obviously is not her regular vets office  We were wonderfully surprised by the level of service provided not only by the doctor but by the techs as well Everyone who handled my dog was very friendly and very understanding  They took excellent care of her and didn't charge me an arm and a leg for doing the surgery  For the price I paid here it would've cost over $400 at her vets office and why pay that when you can get the same things done for less without sacrificing your pets health and well being  I would absolutely reccommend this clinic to everyone.
Good old fashioned Italian food their salad lasagna was excellent when I'm back in az u will see me there lol but really.
I used to frequent another locally owned Tempe coffee shop to get my work done during the day and to visit with friends in the evenings but between good coffee drinks and a perfect laid back atmosphere OSP has definitely won me over They don't pressure you to buy something the owners simply welcome you in and are excited to share their vision for OSP to be a fun collaborative workspace They're passionate about what they're doing and it really shows  but even though they don't have a "one drink minimum" to use their internet or to hang out there you should get a drink anyhow Seriously My favorite is definitely the soy iced chai - super smooth and great flavor though I guess that could be said about their espresso as well :) The location was a little tough for me to find at first - it's in a plaza tucked away on the south side on University between McClintock and Dorsey but it should be much easier to find once they get a real sign out front.
Visiting from Atl my husband and I chose grassroots from yelp reviews  When asking our server what her favorite salad was she stated veg chop with avocado  It wasn't the most expensive salad(so I knew she was truthful) By far best salad I have eve had What a treat and so fresh and healthy Husband had bbq chicken and he loved it He is a very picky eater  Our service was timely pleAsant and didn't overstay their welcome  The owner Chris  was extremely nice and gave us a heartfelt welcome  We may be back for dinner.
Not knowing my way around Mill Avenue in Tempe I was nearly stymied trying to find these theaters The street numbering system made no sense But a quick question to a loitering local solved my problem I was pointed in the right direction and then quickly hit up for a buck for booze Regardless I stumbled into this strange venue noticing people exiting with musical instruments I surmised the underground movie action I was looking for lay upstairs since that's where folks seemed to be gathering Turns out the concession line doubled as the box office line so I asked for one adult and some peanut M & M'sI enjoyed my time at the movie This was a showing of the original 70's version of The Inglorious Bastards and the crowd was chock full of geeks and fanboys eagerly awaiting the upcoming 2009 Quentin Tarantino purposefully misspelled version I was brought here by reading a blurb in the Phoenix New Times but came to find out that this was just one of the many underground movies put on by Midnite Movie Mamacita (wwwmidnitemoviemamacitacom)The theater we were in held only about 100 chairs but was perfect for such a small group (about 40 in attendance) The movie was quite dated and groanworthy at times but the venue was small enough that audience members periodically offered commentary in the spirit of Mystery Science Theater 3000 At the end of the movie a Quentin Tarantino trivia contest (with prizes) was held with the audience I walked out of there with a free movie posterI'll be back to check out this venue if not for another Midnite Movie Mamacita movie then for another event hosted by the Mill Avenue District Community Arts Project (MADCAP).
Best sports bar in Valley hands down Food is great  service is better This is the norm at all locations  I was an original Downtown Majerles regular andnow that I am on the westside its the only place that I will go to watch a game and get a beer.
Ordered the following items: 1 Al Pastor Taco 1 Carne Asada Taco 1 Al Pastor Quesadilla and 1 Carne Asada Burrito Also got the Cochatta drinkAl Pastor items:Great flavor and seasoning on the meat and the addition of grilled pineapple really perked up the dish Food was not greasy or overbearing fatty very very goodCarne Asada: I have eaten Carne Asada at many many restaurants and this was some of the best Smoky flavor but still juicy and not dry I am sure that as the grill seasons over time this Carne Asada will get even betterCochatta: Mixture of ice coffee and Horchata Cuts the acidity of the coffee and adds a nice sweet cinnamon flavor without being overbearing Great DrinkOverall I was impressed with the online ordering system speed of food construction and taste of the food This place has replaced Chipotle and Fillaburtos as our quick Mexican food place of choice.
Lol the glowing reviews below mine must be fake  I've banked with WF for over 5 years mostly at the downtown branch   I found them to have predatory policies that take advantage of people with limited income  Any debits you have will always be taken before any deposits and if you live on a shoestring as do many in these difficult times WF will not have your back here  The personnel seem extra polite but will politely rob you and leave you to die  I have stopped my direct deposits with them as they gave themselves license to help themselves to my money with no recourse to complain  I'm opening a credit union account today anything has to be better than these robbers  Run away.
Love this place  Arley has done my hair twice now  She does a fantastic job  She takes her time and you can tell she really cares about her customers  I will definitely keep coming back  Prices are great and the salon offers you water or soda too.
FABULOUSWe were here for spring break last week and one of hubby's friends said we must eat at Houston's Glad he told us to go here (and he also told us about "The Breakfast Club" - another WIN) We got there pretty early on a weeknight - 6:15ish () - and there was already a LONG wait  Many retired folks go here I think so they probably start arriving at about 5 Note to self go earlier next time if with kids  We got the kids shirley temples and an appetizer and waited for maybe 30 minutes for our table  Got to do some fabulous people watching while we waited I could have SWORN they must have the "HOUSEWIVES OF SCOTTSDALE" there that night (if there were such a thing) We were standing right next to 3 of them I say jokingly  They were of course very nice and charming but I had to laugh to myself that they could film that show hereGot seated - and the food was fabulous I had the ahi tuna salad (was torn between that or the thai noodle salad but daughter voted for this one and I think I was going to share some with her is why I must have let her help me decide this time) Amazing Ate it all  Hubby got their hickory burger and chowed down Kids liked whatever they got too So glad we went here and waited to get a table when we were all famished after a long day of watching some major league baseball Worth the wait.
Best pizza I've ever hadhands down  It lives up to the hype  In fact I've been now 3 times before writing this review as I wanted to make sure my 'best pizza' claim was true  Each time I've had a different pizza and each time I've walked away wanting more  The crust is amazing and it is cool to watch them make the pizzas  Best time to go is for lunchbut get there early as it fills up quick  The restaurant is small and cozywith a cool bar next door if you are caught with long wait  It isn't often that places live up to the hypebut Pizzeria Bianco exceeds it.
This used to be the Rhino Cafe and recently changed owners and the name to Sorella Caffe  This was my first time in here and ordered a latte which was very good  The owner introduced herself and said she hadn't seen me before and asked if I lived around here  She was very personable and I was impressed that she recognized a new customer and was very outgoing  I can certainly see that her new business will thrive  I'll be back for sure.
I don't understand how this place is still in business I recently got a online membership here without visiting the gym first big mistake on my part Im disgusting to even enter the sauna how this place is still open to the public is unknown to me I will be canceling my membership effective tomorrow I will pay a few more dollars at LA Fitness but well worth the extra bucks.
Every time I am in Scottsdale I come in here at least once The food is fantastic and the drinks are great too I love the space & the dark wood beams against a light wall w/ dim lighting make it a spot for any occasion The staff is very friendly & accommodating & they will ensure you enjoy your visit I HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Salad & the duck (if available) but all the food is wonderful I highly recommend to anyone.
One of my local favorites  Avocado rolls are delicious and the selection of micro-brews should satisfy any beer aficionado's taste  Love the atmosphere and the service is generally top notch  (We had one experience where a waitress in the bar/booth section could have used a little more training is customer service and attentiveness)Food selection and quality/taste was superb  If you time it during their lunch specials and/or happy hours you can save some money.
i love this placeafter viewing films here don't know how i'll be able to return to regular theatersthe premium seats (automated recliners) are super comfortable the food and beverage service is quick and easyyou get free popcorn and a blanket and pillow too.
Best pizza and wings by farbeen eating hear for years thought it was time to write a rewiew.
One of the best breakfast joints in the valley.
Tried this a few weeks ago and ever since had a hankering to get back for more Only problem is their stupid hours Who closes at 7PM on the weekdays 2PM on saturday and isn't open on Sunday Guess when you're sitting on a gold mine you can do what you wantBurgers are big and sloppy and awesome That's really all there is to say Decor is kinda cool I posted pics if you want to see some Food is cheap and fast a big plus Its right off the Thomas and Central Lite Rail stop so if you're looking for good eats Lenny's is a good stop Only problem is the hours but hell if I was old Lenny I'd need some time for golf too.
I have been to this place 2 times in the past few years when visiting AZ And both times was amazingThe service and the food is Amazing The Texas Rose is super yummy The Ribeye was cooked to perfectionI wish there was a Lone Star in the California Bay Area.
I was visiting the Scottsdale Gun Club recently and decided to grab lunch afterwards I ended up going to "Pasta-N-More" because it looked like a delicious local small business the type of place I love to support The outgoing owner instantly welcomed me into the restaurant and his staff all treated me like a member of the family I knew from the first moment when I walked in that I had found a new favorite weekly spot to get lunch The prices were reasonable and the menu was massive I tried two items because I couldn't make up my mind the sausage roll and the meatball sliders The sausage roll was amazing think of it like a new twist on the traditional calzone The meatball sliders were equally mind-blowing truly one of the best ideas I have ever heard of If you like meatballs or sliders you have got to try these This place is one of the cleanest and friendliest small businesses I have been to in a very long time I was honestly surprised to see how clean the tables and soda machines were This is not common in restaurants these days No one takes the time to do this anymore and it drives me crazy This place will put any "supposedly" clean restaurant and soda fountain to shame I guarantee it This is one of my big pet peeves and I always make a point to check the machines and tables out Take a look for yourself and order some sliders while your there.
I cannot begin to say just how intensely pleased I am with the service I received with Chris and Phoenix Body Works Had body damage on my fender and bumper from a blown tire on the freeway and when I was calling for quotes everywhere I called was giving me prices way higher than I could manage and most of them offered sub-par customer service  When we called Phoenix Body Works Chris gave EXCELLENT feedback on what we were looking at and asked us to email him pictures of my car He called back later that day just to say he hadn't had a chance to look too deeply at it but to ensure us he would call us the next day How's that for customer serviceWhen he finally did send us our quote he was several hundred dollars cheaper than our next best offer and that was including paint He had offered the most feedback and advice and the best customer service to that point by far and with the huge price difference we were sold When we brought the car in he also offered an alignment for an additional $65 and warned us that with additional small parts (bolts etc) our total may come to about $50 more than our original quote and that he would try to get the paint to be as close a match as possible but made no promises We felt that he was really doing all he could for us and agreed that a mismatching car was better than a non-driveable car so we agreed to the jump in price and resigned to the paint situationBUT WAIT When we picked up the car (which was completed very quickly) it looked PERFECT The paint was a perfect match and even the broken pieces that were only repaired and not replaced looked brand new You'd never know my car was ever damaged AND our total was even lower than our original quote in spite of the extra work he did PHENOMENAL I fully intend to recommend Chris and Phoenix Body Works to everyone I know He did such an incredible and professional job and gave us unparalleled customer service along the way.
I used to live about a fifteen minute walk away from the famous Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Heights It was a little bit of a tourist trap because everyone knew about it thanks to TV shows magazines and the "Best Pizza In America" award I went 1 for 5 in my attempts to get in that line down under the Brooklyn Bridge and the one time I did manage to make it early enough to secure a decent spot the za was definitely worth the 40 minute wait With that in mind I was pretty intrigued by the prospect of a Grimaldi's pizza without the 2 hour line at the original location I think however that there are forces at work to keep me and a Grimaldi's pizza apart and they have followed me to PhoenixThis place is f*cking hard to find without a GPS It's hidden in a shopping plaza across from a movie theater with some of the most understated signage everThe service was pleasant enough and attentive The antipasti and drinks came to the table right away and I hoped within 15-20 mins our pizza would follow20 mins pass 25 Then 30 then 35 Where the hell is the 'za People who were seated after I was are being served tasty looking pizzas and I got nothin' I noticed that Honey Boo-Boo's family who were seated a couple tables away from me about ten minutes after I arrived were enjoying a pie that was identical to what I ordered Shortly after they begin devouring that first pizza they are presented with another pizza which is followed by some discussion with their server and what seems to be some sort of apology As if they had been given the wrong pizza and had begun eating it anyhow Yeah they were eating my pizza The server had goofed something up and within 2 minutes brought a pizza to my table that was not at all what I had ordered as if she had a clue I asked for my check The server told me the manager was coming to my table but no one ever showedShe boxed the pizza up for me (it was mushroom onion and tomato not pepperoni as I had ordered and I'm sorry but I think putting tomato slices on a pizza that already has tomato sauce is dumb and I am not down to become a vegetarian because you botched my order) and I never did receive a check for it but I did tip her what would have been 20% of the billPoor handling of my case leads me to believe they're all new and learning how to work together but I can't see coming back to this particular location Maybe I'll try Scottsdale instead or go to Barro'sBTW- when it comes to pizza in Brooklyn it's Carmine's or Lucali hands down over Grimaldi's anyhow.
i was  anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant- i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian though i do tend to eat that way but i enjoy good food and i really enjoy good diner food we went there at around 1pm on a saturday- they are open from 7am-2pm and it was still relatively busy we were seated right away- the decor is fun and kitschy the service was very good- all of our questions were answered and our server made us feel very comfortable i ordered the reuben- the marble rye was amazing the slaw for the sandwich was both sweet and sour and i definitely couldn't tell the swiss cheese was vegan my friend ordered the coo-coo (') banana pancakes- he couldn't stop raving about them and was very pleased that the side of fruit salad he ordered actually contained different kinds of fruit i'm only sad that i didn't order the eggplant bacon- my boyfriend is now obsessed with it i can't wait to go back to try it  and a piece of their homemade pie.
We fell in love with OHSO immediately and we've been coming to OHSO regularly for some time with our kids for their $10 beer brunch on the weekends I love their breakfast burrito on the beer brunch menu On the regular menu my favorite is the brisket burger with a pitcher of something local or regionalOHSO is a great example of a locally owned restaurant supporting local breweries (while working on their own) and other local community organizations.
Almost didn't go because of the reviews about the service but went anyway because it was close and was in the mood for wings Food was very good (wings were cooked just right extra crispy) The best part was the service our waiter was on time with everything and best of all we had to sit outside (52 degrees) because it was a playoff game and showed up in the fourth quarter and we did not bring a coat for our five year old daughter so the hostess went into the back and let her wear a BWW sweatshirt We will go back for sure.
Breakfast burrito's are pretty much my favorite food in the whole world Fiesta's Country Burrito definitely contributes to this Fresh tortilla eggs potatoes cheese - add refried beans and their amazing green salsa it's a beautiful thing really   Plus they have the best Dr Pepper ever the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup It's also friendly cheap fast and a three minute drive from my house LOVE.
Lot s of Chick-fil-a stores around and all have the same food which is very good BUT this one on Stapley has got to be judged by the perfect service and their great people Even when the place is packed you will be eating within 5 minutes and they will even bring it to your table When you are ready to leave they ask if they can take your take tray for you and are always cleaning and getting ready for the next customer AND they will come around and ask if they can refill your drink for youIT DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THISMy assessment--chicken is chicken but the PEOPLE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE HERE Ted Christy is the ownerSouth of hwy 60 on Stapley at Inverness I moved into an office right behind them and love the locationBOB  STEPHENS.
I hate dealing with this bank  I've never liked their predatory lending practices and everything is a hassle the wait times are always awful  I would rather have dental work than to continue doing business with these people The final straw with these idiots was today  Wells Fargo issued me a refund check for $2700 in the form of a cashier's check for an overpayment I made  I went to this branch and besides waiting in the usual horrendous line because they have 2 people working the teller counter I was forced to wait 25 minutes for them validate their own check  They had to call a number of people to make sure my $27 was cleared  At one point the manager came out who didn't bother to apologize for making me stand there at the teller counter for 25 minutes while they fumbled with researching their own checkWells Fargo -- fumble with your back office shenanigans on your own time  I don't want to wait for 25 minutes to deposit a check into my own account  At least they didn't try to sell me anything this time I suppose I should be grateful for that.
Great service great pricingI'll return for sure They didn't try to force an additional sale on me.
Came here with my bf for a late breakfast Our server was genuine sweet and made sure we were taken care of We started with the giant cinnamon roll which was yummyI ordered the New Princess omelet with a side of corned beef hash Filled with bacon broccoli onion (and a few other things I can't remember) stuffed with cream cheese and smothered in hollandaise this omelet was hands down the best I've ever had It came with these breakfast potato chips on the side that were so SO good The hash was traditional just the way I like itMy bf ordered a begin waffle with a side of biscuits and gravy sausage links and French toast He said his french toast was eggier than he prefers but that might just be his personal preferenceOverall great experience- we will definitely be back.
Artichoke dip is best I ever tasted The Cobb salad was as tasty as it was pretty We will be back.
I have not had beer here but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about It's beer It comes from a tap or a bottle or a can If you think that is an amazing feat worth writing about come by and check out this killer lint I found in my navel It's totally sweet Bro The food was awful I don't know how else to describe it The group I came with ordered an assortment of things and we each tried a bit of the others food to confirm it was cold bland and stale I ordered a burger medium-rare It came overcooked and tasted like rubber The bun was soggy All the veggies on the burger were past their prime It had no flavor None I tried adding ketchup and mustard and it did not help at all I also ordered some Pepperoni Wheels They were okay but the marinara was off It was chunky Like salsa Sort of Large chunks of unidentifiable food stuffs floating in a vaguely red tomato-ish sauce I ate two Wheels and that was enough The ketchup was off too It looked and tasted more like cocktail sauce I don't know maybe the staff was running on a lean mixture this day and muddled up the sauces Who knows I sure don't One of my friends ordered some wings Those were not bad in my book but she didn't like them at all When you can still taste the vinegar over the hot sauce I can see how it can be a turnoff I can't recommend this place Never have I been in and out of a restaurant so fast before We all got to-go boxes which we promptly deposited into the outside trashcan by the parking lot.
I have been five times now Not once have I had a decent meal So if a friend suggests we go I will send them on thier way while I go somewhere good.
Yupha Thai is definitely a "yuppy" in terms of being a great spot to go to  There are not too many places to eat near ASU Research Park which is right off the 101 and Elliot  Yupha is about a couple miles west on Elliot off the 101 freeway  I entered in and saw the special of the day which was a pumpkin dish with whatever meat or tofu  Most Thai dishes are known to be pretty spicy and I was curious to try something more on the sweeter end  It was still right after Thanksgiving and it was an appropriate time to try a festive dishWhile I was waiting they offered us a soup and salad bar to get something to appease us for a few minutes  This is the first time I have ever seen this which is the main reason this rating goes from a 4 to a 5 star  The pumpkin dish was really good  The thai spices to go along with the sweetness was the ultimate complement  All of my friends loved their meals too.
This place is awesome  They have fun cocktails so make sure to sample a couple  For starters you simply must get the duck fat fries  They are the best I've had and the 110 minute egg they are served with is sooooo good  For dinner our table ordered the lamb burger seared ahi and the slow roasted beef - all entrees were delicious  The lamb burger was my favorite For dessert we had the butterscotch boudino and it was so incredible that I can't wait to go back and have another  We will definitely return.
Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food Pearl is an exception to the rule The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock I love that they have different flavors for edamame cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good All of that would equal four stars in my book fifth star is given to the staff Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive Always goes the extra mile I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
I don't know about all those other negative reviews but I seriously crave this place Pho The service is friendly the place is CLEAN which is a BIG PLUS and most of all the food is great.
At first I loved them I got a $50 groupon for X-rays a cleaning and a comprehensive exam A month later I get a bill in the mail for $574 So I'm young no insurance and not that much money This keeps me up at night The next day I leave a voicemail upset as anyone might understand This is my credit we're talking about I didn't get any sleep not to mention that I just can't afford to pay that Shannon calls me back admonishing me for getting upset saying it was a simple mistake an adjustment wasn't made She then continues to scold me and now I'm getting more upset to the point of tears This was your mistake I have a right to be upset I talked to four people in that office when I went in to make sure that I wasn't going to be billed for anything extra Hello Prime Dental when your "mistake" has the potential to affect my livelihood and I'm a struggling twenty something I'm going to get upset Will I ever go back now that I'm getting insurance No Condescending and paternalistic doesn't win patients Shannon was unspeakably rude and when she made me so angry that I was about to cry she hung up on me  I had to call back again to make sure that the mistake was corrected and I wouldn't be receiving another bill a month from now  You had me at that groupon You lost me and everyone I will talk to about this b/c Shannon talks down to the patients you scare the hell out of.
Excellent location of Fry's  Conveniently located just a mile south of the Loop 101 on Alma School Rd in Chandler AZ  Employees are always friendly & ready to help when needed  Store is always stocked up and items are easy to find  They just upgraded their self service check-outs to new computers  Very convenient and easy to use  Usually quick to get in shop and get out =).
I yelp therefore I am  I've been putting this Yelp review off for a while and after dining there this evening I feel compelled to quit procrastinating and finally put pen to paper (so to speak)  Liberty Market is one of my favorite local restaurants every meal that I have ever ordered there has been exemplary  The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and always extremely courteous   I've spent more than a few evenings there at the pizza bar chatting with Dave the owner/executive chef and he has always made me feel welcome in his restaurant and taken care of me The whole Liberty team is awesome and the entire place is a well oiled machine Here's a list of some of the items I have tried:Salmon BLT - DeliciousWhite Pizza - The best I've ever hadMolinari Pizza - FantasticLiberty Bowl - hearty and deliciousRed Velvet Cake - extremely rich and wonderful (get this and split it with your dining companions)And most recently the Weekender Burger which was cooked to perfection juicy and all-in-all just amazing (see pics)I have and will continue to frequent Liberty Market  Give me Liberty Market or give me death.
Tried Sens this weekend and I'll be back again and again  Ten of us took the big table in the back and ate till we were sick  Everything was outstanding and I don't think we missed any of the Tapas  The New Times said that the spiced Pork on a sugar cane skewer was flavorless but after eating 8 or 9 of these little guys - I'd have to disagree  They were one of my favorites (ok maybe not 8 or 9)Beef Ribs Duck Battered Fish Carpaccio and Tofu were all excellent with LOTS of Sapporo  This place begs for repeat performances.
I love this place They offer a varied menu and the food is really good The soups are to-die-for A full bar and many TV's for sports A heated(or not ) outside dining WE go there at least once a week you can get a great meal at a very reasonable priceThey are also doing cork recycling one of the few that doA definite 5+++++ stars.
My Aunt and Uncle were in town and I was tasked by my Mom to find a great place to eat My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in "oh and we want to eat outside" I looked for quite a while at reviews of places I narrowed my search to the $$ places and Tommy V's stood out as one of the top ones in Scottsdale I searched for outdoor seating and again of that list Tommy V's stood out I didn't see any pictures of outdoor seating on Yelp (hint hint Mr cool owner guy who I know is reading this) so I called to make sure they did have the outdoor seating and made a reservations for the 6 of us My first impression was a great one I would describe the decor as clean and classy No clutter just a perfectly lit perfectly decorated modern spot with the music to go with it I don't remember what everyone got but two of us got that Lobster Bisque which was super fantastic and two of us got the "Manila Clams Linguine" which is by far the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever had loaded with clams A few of us got the "Grilled Shrimp Risotto" and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her requestThe service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group Well other than me because I am more of whiskey kind of guy We all had a fantastic time everything we ordered was excellent and the added touch of the owner coming out to see how everything was makes this place an easy 5 stars and a place I would without reservation recommend to anyone Oh the other thing I noticed when I was doing my research was the consistency of positive customer experiences A lot of top reviewed places in Scottsdale seem to be hot or cold depending on your server or the night you go Tommy V's seems to have a formula for getting it right all the time.
This is a wonderful independent establishment in a sea of corporate-bland food  The food is very fresh and quite reasonably priced   I almost always order the pho but the steak salad is just as good on a hot day  Like all great soup bowls you are encouraged to add as much spice basil and lime as you like  Don't let the small size throw you off this place is GREAT.
Michal is fantastic Been dealing with her for years followed her all the way from Chandler Mall No pressure best deal the first time and genuinely cares about her customers If you come here ask for Michal you won't be disappointed.
The concept of this place is perfect- eating healthy food designed by Dr Weil a foremost physician dealing in true Hippocratic medicine (food) The dishes are indeed healthy and very delicious most of the time This particular location had some inconsistencies with their food preparation that left me unimpressed The server was strange and intense which didn't help My five star review is for how the manager handled our gripes Ryan the manager took care of us very well and was able to assure us of fantastic future visits My husband and I love this restaurant and hope the next time we're out in Arizona they live up to their usual reputation of great healthy food Thanks Ryan.
This place is such a great find and so close to my house I can take side streets all the way home:)  I love that it is BYOB Michael and I brought a bottle of wine with us and proceeded to have one the of the best dinners I have had in a long time  We started out with the Calamari Friti which was so tasty  I cannot bring myself to eat the little octopi but Michael has no issues with that and gobbled those little guys up:)  I stick to the fried little rings and I am fine  Then we shared the meatball pizza I was kind of hesitant because I thought it might be whole meatballs on a pizza but it was not and I am still dreaming of this pizza the flavors and the crust were amazing  I cannot wait to come back and try the pasta dishes and the calzones  We ended our dinner with the Tira Misu I think the moment our waitress set the desert down it was gone in 5 minutes  This was such a great dinner and the price cannot be beat including the $500 corking fee the bill totaled $3500  Not Bad.
The food was great but the service was horrible 1) When we made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion which it was: my birthday (Yes I had a separate party with my friends but this was my birthday dinner w/ my parents)  At the end of the night the manager asked if we enjoyed our complimentary dessert but it wasn't complimentary We paid for it At the end of our meal our server said "oh is it like a special occasion I saw that on the reservation but you all are so chill I didn't believe it" 2) Our server flirted with the patron at the next table the entire night No joke We had to actually interrupt their conversation to get our check It was awkward For us.
This was a Groupon gamble for me After visiting the website the thought crosses your mind as if this will be a good idea for a non Korean but I figure this is Phoenix I love karaoke and so do my friends I have nothing to lose so "Buy Now" it is Go figure I wait until it practically expires but our roommates b-day was coming up so we figure perfect timing You have to reserve the room in advance which I did online and set everything up though a couple emails (they were very responsive) Note: This place caters to ASU students pretty hard core so it's fairly empty in the Summer and you might be able to get away with not reserving At this point I'm the only one who has dealt with the biz so we pull up with all our friends and the place looks closed We walk in and its completely empty but an employee walks out confirms my name and takes us to a room He gives me a quick "how to" on the machine and off we go ***Here are 3 main reasons why you should try this place over Guitar Hero at home*****1 You can bring your own liquor We just bought the sodas from them and mixed it all ourselves 2 They have tambourines and maracas in the room Adds to the fun for people who are not singing and when was the last time you used a tambourine or maraca3 The experience I don't know of any strictly karaoke places in the valley Another group or two showed up and we all kept crossing paths when we had to order more drinks go to the bathroom and by the end of the night I was having shots with one of the guys from the other room Everyone in our group had a blast The setup was all there with the 2 mics speakers laser lights our own liquor What else do you need Protip: Plan on taking a taxi home so everyone can drink and you'll unleash a whole other level of fun.
3rd stike I will never return to this location This is the third and final time I will set foot in this location Todays encounter was by far the worst My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go She replied yes we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation She said "OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY" I then asked to speak with the manager whom happened to be walking up I stepped to the side to address the manager I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often From the start the manager was very condescending I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake) After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply "oh well" while staring blankly into my face I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand "I'M LARRY WHITE THE OWNER I AM LoLo' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground childish attempt to display authority I politely informed Mr White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me I thanked Mr White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request As mentioned my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location It is really sad that the level of service is not the same But here is a suggestion maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do HIRE MORE STAFF Or better yet turn down the music and have the DJ help out It's a restaurant not a night club But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak.
The rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room 1 Wacom tablet and mouse1 button down shirt (yes a shirt)  only noticed the shirt missing then when I returned home noticed that my Wacom tablet was missing as I needed to edit some images I only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me (it's a messenger bag) Waiting to hear back from the hotelif it's not what I want to hear then I'll file a policy report I fault myself for not noticing right away but I've never ever had this happen to me before Not good times.
There is no question that Yelp did me a massive favor in finding Miguel Flores My husband had decided it was time to take the plunge and have our AC replaced Flores AC was not the first or last company we called but between crazy sales tactics tirades about competitors no shows etc he is the one we chose When I originally called it was a Saturday morning and Miguel said he could be at my house in a couple of hours He showed up on time and astonishingly my husband really liked him Everything was very straight forward We told him what we wanted he explained what he would do and said he would email over a quote That quote was to us later that day with the exact model number information which allowed us to research it as much as we wanted I was not at home for the install but a glowing report came back from my husband He showed up as he said he would with his crew which is a family affair My husband stressed the word professional to me several times in describing their work and the care they took of our house He spoke of the efficiency of which they worked together how one would say the tool needed and where it was and the other went directly there to get it He mentioned they took care to cover all the areas they worked in Miguel mentioned that if we called around we would find his price to be the best We never did get pricing on the same model so I couldn't say it for sure but we feel that we paid the right amount to the right company.
Chicken mole tacos crazy salsa bar HORCHATAI have been living in San Diego for three years and had never once had homemade horchata loaded with fresh strawberries and cantaloupe pecans and cinnamon But now I have and I'm not sure that I can go back to the soft-drinky stuff of various fill-in-the-blank-bertosThey could start a lucrative business just selling that horchata but the food is amazing as well My friends and I slid through the door about half an hour before closing and were immediately greeted with menus and chips We ordered then proceeded to raid the salsa bar It wasn't at its full glory at the end of the night but 'twas still extensive Honestly I'm kind of a ho when it comes to condiments so trust me when I say we looted that baby Hard I can't pick a favorite but I was particularly fond of the avocado-cilantro as well as the chipotle salsa Them tacos is the stuff of dreams Layered corn tortillas rich and steamy chicken mole fresh onions y cilantro For all of a few minutes I was in heaven And then I was in a food coma Two tacos don't sound like much but it is definitely a good amount of food Especially if you've been sucking the life out of your horchataService was fast and friendly the dining area was clean and pleasant and I am officially crowning La Condesa my favorite taco shop of all time Big words coming from a California girl I know but I wasn't even drunk when I went (FYI I got drunk after and it all stayed down) I will be back La Condesa Mark my words361 miles can't stop my love for you.
I am no expert on Korean food and I will never be Oxknee soup How does one eat an animal's knee HuhWhatever What I had was wonderful I had beef in very hot boiling broth with cabbage and carrots Also had pork which was more flavorful than I was expectingThere's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me so I cannot vouch for the more exotic items they offer But if you like Korean and/or want to try something new (and really good) then check this place out.
My girlfriend and I stayed here this past weekend for a girls weekend away  I totally forgot to get an early check in so I called from the airport and they were able to do it no problem  Front desk and concierge staff was so friendly  Jenny sat down with us at length and helped us figure out hiking and eating  Our first evening they left champagne and snacks in our room as a happy birthday gift So sweet  The shuttle was great and the drivers nice and helpful  The pool was perfect and not too crowded on Saturday afternoon  They were very accommodating when we needed scissors bandaids extra bags etc  Our only complaint was no elevator as my friend had a huge bag since she was flying internationally for work from our weekend  Also - the location cannot be beat  Wouldn't stay anywhere else when I return someday.
This was my third trip the the Wy-Knot Café since they recently opened in January  On my first visit it was love at first bite with the signature turkey and brie sandwich and the Mediterranean beet salad on the side and the ordered the iced mango green tea which was made right in front of me with the perfect blend of loose leaf flavors  Second visit the black bean soup and a side of my "newly favorite" Mediterranean beet salad were the perfect combination of soup and salad served with flatbread on the side  With a bit of feta and green onions on top my meal here was once again "freshalicious"  The third trip I took my family in on a Sunday for a breakfast  My husband ordered a delicious iced caramel macchiato and I knew exactly what I wanted I had been waiting for the perfect moment to try their Cupcake Cappuccino ever since my first visit  I have never tasted "Cupcake" coffee syrup and with the barista's suggestion a white chocolate cupcake soy capuccino was born  It was everything I dreamed it would be and more  The soy foam was thick and on top colorful sprinkles you would find on your favorite cupcake  You must try this With a helpful suggestion from Jackie the owner I got the Tomato Basil & Roasted Garlic Frittata  It was the a bountiful plate and the frittata was infused with that crazy good triple cream brie seasoned roasted red potatoes whole grain toast fresh greens & fruit  With my foamy Cupcake latte and "freshalicous" meal I had an outer body experience that took me from a sidewalk café in Italy then to the Greek Isles on to a breezy bed and breakfast in Tuscany  Back in Phoenix my husband enjoyed his BLT and seasoned potatoes my son was presented this Cinnamon Swirl French Toast where a colossal slice stood 2-3 inches high and was swirled with generous cinnamon ribbons  No this wasn't the Stuffed French Toast that many have raved about but it was absolutely the best French toast my 10 year old has ever had and the 2 thick slices of bacon were truly savory  (I couldn't help but break off a nibble)  My 3 yr old daughter got the pancakes and they tasted like something between a crepe and a pancake  Very distinctive and yummy  I can definitely taste the fresh herbs and spices in every made to order meal and I love the endless menu options including vegan Oh yeah Wy-Knot Cafe is definitely the home of the Cupcake Capuccino and Latte  I can't wait for my fourth visit.
This is my least favorite bar that I have been to in Old Town for one main reason  THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD  WHAT IS THAT  THE MUSIC IS TOOOOO LOOUUUDDDD  I CAN'T HEAR YOU WHATTTT  HUHHH  (Hand gesture to the door) and you leaveThe biggest joke I was told was that this is the "#1 Lounge in Scottsdale"  There is no way that is the caseI can't stand this spot  The bartenders are good but they can't even hear your order  I have yet to have a good time here and don't think much about coming back to this spoteven if it is busy.
I love this CSA They have always given me more than what I bargained for Now we can add on bread beef chicken eggs and dairy SO AWESOME I rarely need to go to the grocery store because of this I've never received anything rotten In fact everything has lasted MUCH longer than store produce  For the cost I believe this is the best CSA out there Also i don't feel guilty about throwing the left-overs in my composter since it's all organic.
My previous review says it all when it comes to the meal and atmosphere but it lacked an opinion on the dessert Well now I can add my opinion Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of tiramisu It's moist flavorful and amazing They also serve Nutella deserts cream puffs and more I've decided that dessert is a must here.
For reasons I don't fully understand I gave this place another shotalbeit my last try was in Phoenix  Well if nothing else they are consistently bad regardless of the localSo what's my beefFirst the table was filthynot dirtyfilthy  At fist we thought it was just sticky but as my wife wiped it down with a baby wipe it turned black with god knows whatNext we ordered coffe  Coffe and cream (milk actually) showed up and after we poured it into the coffe we found some sort of an orange substance in the cream pitcher   The waitress speculated it might have been crayon  CrayonreallyWe told the waitress we wanted to look at the menu for a few more minutes   Fifteen minutes later and she never came back  While we were waiting the wife took another baby wipe and wiped off the exterior of the coffe carafe  Well that was something that hadnt been through a dishwasher in quite a whileSo what to say here  Service bad  Cleanliness and this is in the parts of the restaurant you can see worse I can only imagine what's going on elsewhere  Food couldn't tell you  We never got that far but some how and based on my experience at the Phoenix location I'm well certain we didn't miss anything.
this was the first time in this place we wanted pizza and stopped herethe pizza:the crust had to be frozenbarely cooked and so disgustingly saggy in oilthe sauce was the most horrifying experience in my life so grosssweeten with sugar it must be because they are definitely using can pizza sauce the cheese was not cheese it tasted like rubberi picked up the stupidly cut small square and the whatever was came off all togetherrubberwe order half spinach and half pepperoni it was so damn oily the spinach was very salty and the pepperoni (very little) probably the cheapest brand you can geti was very surprise how busy they were i just can not  understand why a person that like good food (like me) would come back in herethis was the most disgusting PIZZA THAT I EVER TRIED IN MY LIFEfrozen pizza from walmart is 100% times betterand the damn thing (i can't call it pizza anymore) was $22 for a 16"waist of moneytime and my stomach hurt like hellTERRIBLEDo not go.
This place is great We've been coming here for the last few years and they always do a great job Reasonably priced prompt service and friendly customer service What more could you ask for The owner of the company is often in and is very friendly and often the one checking in the clothes and ringing you up - it's nice to see a hands-on owner that cares about his customers Always happy to support local businesses.
I just ordered delivery  It came hot and tasted delicious  I will order delivery again.
The jade red chicken is amazing The cookies are the perfect ending to a meal.
I have to give another yelp out to Jeff and A 1 Minute Key Service Jeff changed out my locks earlier this year (see previous review) and I recently needed his services again I locked my keys in the house on a Saturday while my husband and I were outside Jeff was on his way to another call and then came straight over He let us in and even fixed a lock that had been sticking due to the warming weather while he was at it I can't say enough great things about him and his services He's the only locksmith you'll ever need.
Have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn't change in any way  Everything about Donovan's was outstanding - from the time we arrived to the time we left it was nonstop wonderful food ambiance and service  We enjoyed:Crab cake appetizer:  It was more like a crab continent - this thing was big   Big and full of crab meat goodness without any filler  Crab crab  and more crab  Spinach salad:  Light blend of spinach mushrooms bacon and a tangy dressing - a great transition into the main courseFilet with shrimp scampi:  My filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through  Entrees come with vegetables (snap peas and carrots - crunchy and flavorful) as well as a choice of potato  We both chose baked potatoes which were garnished with all the fixin's tableside  YumWine and water glasses never went empty - every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask  The team made us feel both appreciated and pampered  I wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detailMy only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert  Guess a return visit has to happen soon.
I love love love Baskin- Robins Again another place i grew up eating ice cream at ever since in Elementary school so definitely over 15 years  I love their two scoop ice cream sundaes with whip cream hot fudge almonds and cherry  I typically always chose chocolate chip  They make it super fast  So if you ever want just regular ice cream and not yogurt i would go here  I've also purchased ice cream cakes for birthdays and they are sooo good.
I ate here once about a week after it opened and stopped by three other times to sample beer because they had an outrageous tap beer selection for Chandler Service was  how do I put this lets say very unprofessional I met the owner on my second visit and understood why I bet my wife that this place wouldn't last a year She said 13 months to hedge her bet   I have since heard it has shut down and reopened as the "Watersedge"   Update (1-09)  landlord has locked the doors  Guess the name change didn't help things  Enough said.
This review update is for the food only  I ordered the short rib since I had not eaten a thing all day so a hardy dish was what I was craving  OMG  I never would have imagined how good it would be  The short rib melted in your mouth  The Parmesan bread pudding was wonderful  A little on the salty side but I LOVE salt.
Breakfast or brunch at lon's is consistently delicious Good service Great ambience Solid menu Priced right for food and experience  Go when you have time to relax and take in the experience.
My friends at the Anytime Fitness told me to check it out So one day I ventured here after a workout and what can I sayI am hooked  Love the airy atmosphere  beautiful holiday decor so many areas to sit choices galore for drinks food looks delicious and the price is nice $4 & change gets you a 24 oz latte and its so good Live bands too amazing  A new addiction.
I've been to plenty of gyms Here in Phoenix and in the east coast This has been by far the best gym I've been to It's not huge It's a local central Phoenix gem However all the equipment is in stellar condition It's always clean The staff is incredible The patrons are always friendly And the fact that I can knock out my training and taning all under one roof is awesome The environment lens itself to training as well It's really pushed me to actually start getting some results Lastly although I have not utilized any of the trainers they all seem to be quite knowledgeable Unlike some of the other gyms I've been to before You can't go wrong here Great place Great value.
I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle What a beautiful performance The scenery was beautiful the dancers were great the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training overall it was amazing This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again Very professional and very entertaining.
This is a great place Very fun barlots of tv's for sports And most importantly the BBQ is awesome All smoked on site and all different types Definitely worth checking out.
I love this restaurant I love the atmosphere and I love the food but I have been extremely displeased with this place in one area I love places with primo cards and member cards where you can accumulate points for free money Which Half Moon does which is great BUT the past 2 times I have gone to RECIEVE my ten dollars off my meal my card was restarted and the server said it was used on my last visit I also order the same meal for my boyfriend and myself and I also pay the same price I go there often to receive points so I can enjoy 10 dollars off every so often and the past 2 times I have not received Very displeasing I feel like the servers are going after I pay and adding the ten dollars off and keeping my tip I would hope not-After several confusing incidents with my promotional card the team of half moon really took the time to work things out with me I appreciate it when Customers have an issue and management takes time to address it so I'm changing my 3 stars to a five star.
The food the decor the happy hour "sigh' I will miss this place as much as I will miss my friends out in Arizona I just came back from visiting & I am so glad we went to Blue Wasabi I'm not going to sit here & list everything I ate All i'm going to say is EVERYTHING I ate was good My friends & I ordered most of the Happy Hour menu To drink I had a cherry bomb Words can not describe the happiness that was my lips & tongue JOY JOY JOY I have NEVER had a drink as good as that one & trust me I've had ALOT of drinks Don't be intimidated by the fact that the guys behind the bar are not Japanese They are trained sushi chefs & have years of experience If I could I would move to Arizona just so I can be closer to the Blue Wasabi Oh & the customer service was on point GO.
There are three people that regularly work here Pretty normal The 40 year old lady with the glasses is pretty cool She seems like the bosslady Like most Circle K's this one is cleanNo jalepenos in the hot dog area Apparently "they spoil too quickly" Oh yeah this place has a different type of 44oz fountain cup every other day.
I feel Spanish Fly is one of the best things that has happened in Scottsdale in terms of adult entertainment for quite some time - especially during the hot summer months  In the past if you wanted to go to a pool during the day you would need to get a hotel room at the Valley Ho W etc  Spanish Fly offers: Typically no cover great house music quaint but beautiful grounds and lots of people from all walks of life  just having a good time  I have just as good of a time here at the pool parties as I do at the larger local hotels or Vegas resorts - often even better as it's so convenient  Nights too can be enjoyable but more chill - feels like you're at some small club in the Mediterranean  Can't wait for the summer pool season to start.
Glass Creations is one of the most beautiful stores Not only does it have beautiful glass but they also specialize in beads purses and art Owners are extremely friendly and helpful A great place to buy gifts or something for yourself They always have the latest in holiday trends Bought my first Christmas gift here and plan on going back.
Bookmans is the best  I cringe every time I have to buy a book anywhere else  The selection is huge the books are in great shape (and don't smell weird) and the prices are awesome.
Best  fitness gym around Matt is a fantastic supportive coach Classes are fun and very enjoyable Would recommend to anyone wanting something more no matter what level of fitness.
Being from Cali and had the oppertunity to watch movies at the premier sites Of course this place does'nt match up to them But for being a local theater that offers Tues and Thurs specials I have no problem with this place I usally come here during the week days late to watch a movie with the family to stay away from the kids who would rather talk then watch a movie The D box is ok to try once but I will not be using again.
Best place ever The product is amazing and the is friendly knowledgable and made me feel welcome.
Small simple and accommodating menu  Excellent service ambiance and portions = phenomenal value  I highly recommend the house cheeseburger with "fondue" style cheese sauce and side of fries Perfect date nite with the BF  We'll be back again soon.
The front desk delivered tacos to the room from Jack-in-The-Box at 4AMIf that isn't service I don't know what is.
The team at Robert Wesley Jewelers that helped me marry my beautiful wife is first on my list I worked with Bobby (Jr) throughout my search for the perfect engagement ring and his dad was always available to give his stamp of approval when we made a decisionBobby had the patience of a saint considering 6 months passed from my first visit until we finally had the perfect diamond and setting We first had several loose diamonds flown in and Bobby educated me on their differences After a few visits we found a perfect diamond within my budget Then the real challenge began I was searching for a halo setting in yellow gold Bobby emailed me each designer that they carried and we started with dozens of options and narrowed it down over the next several weeks We found "the" setting at least 3 separate times until we finally brought in the female for a viewing While I tried on a Rolex or two they directed my now wife to the rings and were able to find the setting she really lovedWe had the perfect engagement ring and she of course said yes After the engagement we were all able to work together on the wedding band This was custom made so the diamonds went around the entire band but still matched the engagement ring perfectly I have since worked with Bobby for a custom engraved gold pendant for a Christmas gift and a set of diamond stud earrings for my wedding gift These guys are the best in the business for an engagement ring There are no high pressure sales tactics just a beautiful store with folks that truly have a passion for customer service This has been family owned since inception over 100 years under the same name I am grateful for the relationship I have at Robert Wesley Jewelers and for my happy wife.
Very helpful staff  They changed my tires and didn't charge me for labor.
After growing up in SoCal and having Tommy's chili burger whenever we wanted it was a shock when we moved to AZ 9 years ago to not be able to have a Tommy burger anytime we wanted {or needed like after a night of drinking} Well I think all that has changed now that we 'discovered' Chili Billy's I think it's as good as Tommy's but my wife thinks it's even better than Tommy's He definitely has an excellent recipe and the chili works so well for a chili cheese burger I can't wait to go back  I almost forgot the fries they are the some of the best I've ever had anywhereThe owner was very friendly and talked with us about how he started and other items he had on the menu the pastrami sounds really good {Sorry but I forgot his name}.
Stopped in Casablanca on 8/16 I was in town on business   It was winding down with very few people   However I liked the decor and feeling Kyle and Sarah were excellent  Next trip I hope to catch the live music.
One of the best sandwiches in this town I eat here every Friday Fresh bread with fresh high quality ingredients You get what you pay for It's worth it.
Let me start off by saying it was a awesome massage I didn't want to leave But be aware that it starts off a bit odd thankfully I was with a great friend which made me way more comfortable than if I was alone Starting off no one really tells you what will happen you simply lay down & wait The men are in & out of the room several times bring a warm water foot soak coving your body with a large towel warm neck roll & a towel to cover your eyes  But but when they start the start & it's fantastic I really love the pressure point relief It was priced very reasonably  $20 for 30 mins & $30 for 60 mins  I will defiantly go back & next time my husband wants to join in the fun.
Just had a wonderful experience at Dee's They were very understanding of my daughters body shape and fitting her into a leo that fit her beautifully and left her feeling confident Could not have asked for more-.
A great Italian deli on par with the best Italian delis in the US I  tried 6 or 7 dishes I was thoroughly satisfied with how authentic and fresh the food was This is a standout Italian eatery amongst a lot of competition in Scottsdale.
We love Peruvian food--the simplicity the flavors and the way it seems to naturally bring friends and family together  We are very happy to have found ContigoThis very unassuming restaurant sits quietly in a suite of a typical suburban strip center  I learned long ago never to discount such places and I encourage others to do the same You will otherwise miss little delights like ContigoWe were greeted upon entering the door as if we were family  It was no surprise to learn that Contigo is a quintessential family business and one of the quintessential American dream--a family leaving their ancestral home in Peru for the promises of the United States and opening a business doing what they do best:  preparing authentic Peruvian food and creating a warm inviting atmosphereand it all begins with the Pisco Sour  This national drink of Peru uses Peruvian Pisco as the base liquor and the addition of lime (or lemon) juice syrup ice egg white and Angostura bitters  DeliciousAll of our usual favorite dishes were present and accounted for on the menu and since we were with our own friends and family we passed plates and tasted everything  We whet our appetites with a nice variety of fresh ceviches which perfectly led us to delicious main courses including Saltados (lomo pollo and mariscos) Tallarin Chaufas and Suprema de Pollo  All exceptionally prepared  All extremely reasonably pricedSo make your way to this nondescript corner of this nondescript strip center in suburban Chandler and enjoy this exceptional gem of a restaurant  It's comfortable casual and very much like you're dining with a warm and welcoming Peruvian family--because you really are.
A drive through that's  open when you're hungry and everything else is closed Score Good food clean facility good service and lots of choices on the menu We eat here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed Love the Carne asada plate and the tortas Yumm.
ok finally went back to roka last night and im speechless im not sure if it was the amazing service by the GM Joy or one of the greatest servers ive ever had Casey  They sat us in a small table in the back corner which was great  When i came in i knew everything i wanted to order but that soon changed after casey started to tell me about their specials  We ordered the rock shrimp tempura which is half the price as what we are used to  paying at NOBU in LA and 10000 times better here at roka  Next came this scallop flamed seared with king crab avocado and who knows what else see the pictures every bite was pure happiness   Casey helped us to decide on some great sashimi selections  The salmon sashimi there is out of this world its hard to explain that a piece of fish in the AZ desert is fresher than anything ive ever had in LA or NYC But it was  then came our steak i wish we had went for the a3 waygu but my GF decided to only have the filet  Here again who would believe that steak at roka akor is BETTER than at masteros or Morton's  The steak melts in your mouth its unbelievable  Im not a big fan of desert but this huge desert platter was served for my GFs birthday  And im sure i was eating what other reviewers called the "snozberry" i hate coconut everything but found myself eating it all i couldn't stop  January is Steak month at roka so we will be back shortly and if i can ever find the time i would love to do the sushi classes  Bottom line thank you Joy for changing our minds and if you want a server who will give even the best foodies a run of their knowledge ask for CASEY  OH and anyone who complains about the price get real this is some of the best food you will have and the prices are 1/3 what you will pay in LA or NYC with food that is out of this world delicious.
Bosa kicks ass Every donut i tried( a lady never reveals her number) was delicious Awesome variety as well and super duper cheap wallet friendly prices They also have a nice assortment of drinks alsothey even have boba drinks donuts and boba drinks available 24 hrs a day not sure it i will ever crave these two things together but now i know if the feeling ever comes over mei can get it at at the drive thru at 3:13am in my bath robehow is this not good news.
I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past SaturdayWe finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime  I was amazed at how natural it tasted  There was nothing artificial about it it just tasted exactly like it should  These are very good very simple cheesecakes  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from all at very fair prices  YUMMY.
Not a review on their food or drinks (don't really recall) but their service  I was flipped off by my waitress after leaving the restaurant  (My friend paid the bill since we were out celebrating my b-day so no clue on tip other than there was one)  I have no desire to go to a place where an employee would do that to a paying customer and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.
this place is great small fantastic service a dang good bar food met a couple of friends there for lunch today excellent fish and chips the girls had salads nice leafy mix greens good size portions and like I say GREAT service.
Dr Perry Fraiman is the most caring and accomodating dentist you will find  Several years ago my husband needed two front crowns replaced  My husband asked for my help choosing the right tooth color  Dr Fraiman said for us to swing by his office and he'd show us the choiceswe even went outside to look at it in natural light  Now where would you find a specialist who would do thatVery recently I had a huge mouth sore  He asked me to pop in at my convenience 3 week in a row to check on it He also gave me a very helpful prescription  His dental work is amazing and his staff is always happy and helpfulCheck him out.
It was alright I was there with real good peeps so it made all the difference Food was pretty good Wings were grilled and kind of different However i MUST say they forgot Shrimp in my friends shrimp-something-pasta-special I mean C'mon We did get free desert out of this and of cuz they replaced his dish My own Miso Salmon was not bad but i think rice it came with was super buttered up but tasted good And all food came out blazing fast too What i was really bummed about that my Mojito as basically lemony water I sent it back 2x till 3rd one was ok JUST OK I did get charged 2x for this though and did not feel like making a scene being with friends and all I did not come there for a crowd but there we some girls in tight jeans there and some dudes and some couples I do not care much What is unacceptable is that Bar/Tavern has watered down drinks That is BAD I mean B A D  I am not a picky person but this is BS pardon my English AND i ended up paying 2x for this water Bleah doubt i will be backEDIT: I thought about it compared to my other experiences i had at some other similar joints and i am bumping this one down a notch Sorry The Vig get your act together Swanky decor aint cutting itEugene.
Worst service everdo you have ALL DAY new teller each time I go the manager in her office on the phone "every time"with the door closedis she aware of her customers at all  The first year they opened was greatnow it seems as if they wish we would all bank on line instead of going insorry I like going in but will go to Bell and Grand insteadchao bambina.
Guess what I try the Gyros and I got hook  Fresh and tasty  Home like environment They also provide you with free refills and WiFi  What a deal  Give Pita Kitchen a try you Got nothing to lose.
Yum yum yum  My friend and I accidentally happened upon this place for lunch and we were pleasantly surprised that the food was so good  I'm not a big fan of Italian restaurants but I will definitely be heading back to this place  They have lunch combo specials where you can get pasta and a salad or pizza and a salad for $9  I had the Sicilian pizza and the Misto salad and my friend had the Pasta Rustica and the Misto salad  Everything was delicious  The crust on the pizza was delish and the sauce used in the Rustica was very fresh  They also bring out some fresh warm doughy bread with olive oil and balsamic before your meal  We also learned that every Monday and Tuesday they serve spaghetti and meatballs for only $5 -- dine-in or take out  We've already planned another trip back during happy hour so we can test out their drink selection :).
This dennys has changed a lot in the past 2 months It appears a new manager or corporate finally came to visit and cleaned the place up No more mad waitresses or 50 minute waits for 1 plate of food Way to go.
Why am I reviewing a grocery store for crying out loud Because this grocery store is a foodie theme park How many grocery stores do you know where you can just hang out with people This is the best place to meet up with friends and the shopping here is not half bad eitherCons Well if want to actually do your grocery shopping here regularly you better buy some extra stuff for friends because you will soon be missing rent payments and living on their couch For the basics it's just impractical to come here but for the occasional "splurge" purchase I would come here over AJ's ten out of ten times Really I treat this place more as a great meeting place with things to do than a place to shop.
Called and was told they had clear con-tact paper First of all if you work in "kitchen" you should know the brand con-tact Showed up and it took 3 employees to take me to the con-tact section and I was then told they did NOT have clear They all walked away talking about how they were going to get drunk tonight  They DID have it  I found it on my own .
I thought I would update this review because after over two years this is still one of my favorite restaurants I have never had a bad or eh meal here and I have always had great service My favorite is still the orange chicken The crab wontons are still amazing I also now have a few new favorite there The sweet and sour chicken is actually pretty good and I am not usually a fan The five vegetable fried rice could be a meal in itself The berries flambe for dessert are really good The duck is good but not fantastic like the other dishes I also like the wonton soup It always has enough pork and wontons in it and has a nice kick If you sign up for their newsletter you do not get bombarded with emails but will get a coupon for your birthday and emails with announcements for holiday specials about 3 times a year For the holidays they also offered a gift card special.
Loves me some Trader Joe'sOnly disappointment I have is their tortellini  Thank god I bought it for myself and not to make for companymore than half of it was garbage  Oh welleverything else here is great--including the staff.
The cardio equipment is in a constant state of disrepair  It is not uncommon to see at least 6 "Out of Order" signs on just the cardio equipment  Even when I actually manage to get on a machine that's not out of order I usually come to find out that it is near breaking to  Wobbly steps on the elipticals peeling treadmill belts squeaky bikes and the list goes on  They are desperately in need of making some investments in their equipment.
Great food Nice Lighting Attractive bartenders Amazingly concocted martinis Love this place.
I had a bad address for today's restaurant outing & ended up warily sticking my head in the door at this nearly windowless place  I was promptly greeted by "Mother" (in her 70s)  I liked her & she told me they have been there for 32 years so I decided to give it a tryThis is a cozy comfortable dimly lit place & there were already a lot of customers well before noon  I started with the "all-you-can-eat" salad bar where there was a lot to choose from but you have to fit it "all" on a small plate & you only get one trip so I stacked it up like Mt Vesuvius  For the entree I ordered an open-face hot turkey sandwich which comes with mashed potatoes & cranberry sauceWhile waiting for the sandwich I was anticipating only 2 or 3 Stars for this place & frankly wishing I had gone somewhere else because I was annoyed by the "one trip" salad bar rule but then my main course arrived  OMG it's HUGE  :-))   It was totally delicious too as was the generous serving of mashed potatoes & also the cranberry sauceWhat a great lunch this turned out to be & it's probably a good thing you only get one trip to the salad bar because Mother here feeds you what amounts to "all you can eat" by the time it's over with anyway  My server was great too & it was only $828 for the whole shebang  Yum.
For a nice relaxing hike not too far from Phoenix the White Tank Mountains are a great place for it I've hiked the Waterfall Trail twice -- the first time in early spring when the waterfall was dry and the second time today early winter after a week of rain  This time there was a nice amount of water trickling down the rocks Not a gushing waterfall but as good as one can get in Phoenix The rock formations around the waterfall are amazing and a bit awe inspiring to think about how long it took for the elements to create such magnificent crevices out of the tough granite stoneThere are quite a few trails in the park area but I thoroughly enjoyed the Waterfall Trail It is a pretty short trail -- maybe about a mile or so -- well-paved with little "real" hiking involved There are informational placards along the trail that explain the history of the area and the different fauna and animals inhabiting the area It is a great opportunity to see tons of Saguaros Cholla and Barrel Cactus  And beside the awesome waterfall there are some fantastic petroglyphs carved on the many rocks along the trailFor some great scenery and a little history I'd highly recommend taking a few hours to walk/hike/jog the trail It's kid and dog friendly and well worth it in the end -- especially if you get to see a real live waterfall in the midst of a desert.
How can you not love Charming Charlies in generalI love that this Tempe Marketplace location exists (now I dont have to drive to fashion Square or CenPho)My only complaint about this location is that if youre here in the afternoon and trying to look at things on the east side of the store the sun will blind youThe staff here is very helpful and thats great cuz lets face it CC can be very overwhelming This is the 1st CC ive been to where I havent encountered an attitude from one of the employees Kudos Keep up the good friendly work.
What a wonderful experience We actually were told about this local gem by a waiter at another restaurant Then we found out that they had also been featured on one of my favorite shows Diners and Drive Ins so I figured if it got raves from Guy I couldn't pass up a chance to visit too From the first friendly hello when you enter the door you are treated as if you are an old friend even if  you're a first time visitor like I was  The food is amazing Homemade pasta is so yummy Be advised portions are very generous-so share or be prepared to take home leftovers which is not a bad thing Everything from appetizers to deserts can be shared and you will still leave feeling very satisfied and very happy that you have been to Giuseppe's on 28th.
Always delicious and always there when I need it Here is another place that I am a creature of habit Side by side salad no pico and extra salsaFresh and tasty  The side by side salad isn't on the menu but they are always ready to make the exception and create my favorite meal  Lettuce mexican cheese sliced avocado grilled chicken drizzled with their green tomatillo salsa  Of course I make a visit to their salsa bar and add some hot red salsa lots of cilantro and a few squeezes of fresh lime  Ahhhhhh Baja FreshI Love you.
I've been here many times Today they had a new menu I like seafood so I get a pasta bowl I tasted it and the noodles were chewy I mentioned it to the waiter and he spoke with a manager Manager came right over and explained that it was a new noodle with a very different texture He understood  I wanted a more usual soft noodle and replaced my meal without hesitation And that he would remind wait staff to mention the new noodle difference The replacement was great So kudos to great service and understanding  They also do still have the make your own bowl which I might stick with next time :).
Great fast service No lines In and out quick Convenient I will be back.
Oh my god Such a wonderful place With tons of options and great service our family went home happy :)Usually we find it tough to find a place with both veg and non veg options plus kids options This one fit perfectly for everyone.
We love this place The service is great and the food even better We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes but it is worth it.
I had a great time here very friendly people  great drinks  and the best spinach salad I have ever had  I had the chicken picatta ohhh man soooo good   Kudos to our waiter Ken for the great service and tips on the chardonay it was the perfect matchIve eaten there probably a dozen  times love the happy hour specials my fav is tuscan muscles the wine selection is outstanding the bartender AJ had us laughing for hours We really enjoy going there  great patio when the weather permits.
The vet down the street had referred me to Poverty's Pets as we had found an abandoned doggie I had not heard of Poverty's Pets before so I checked out their website and was moved to see how much they have helped other dogs I met up with Kim for some assistance in placing our rescue for adoption -- she was AMAZING No like seriously amazing Great organizationmake sure you like their Facebook page I love love love seeing all the great work they do to help connect doggies with "Forever Families".
I woke up late one morning & did not have a chance to eat breakfast so my husband swung by my office & gave me a scone to eat It was the best scone I have ever had so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's I had to go and check it out myself I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places) but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go But the coffee was not even the best part They had 2 different kinds of scones today Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch Great little place to stop in the morning This was the perfect start to my Friday I will definitely be back.
Absolutely horrid We ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver The main dishes were ok it's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki The fried rice was the worst I've ever had I can't believe they even choose to send this out The crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just Philadelphia cream cheese alone The eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste After waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing We will never order here again.
I went here while on vacation visiting my friend Neither of us had been there before but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast so we gave it a try The staff was totally rude Before we went we called to check the hours The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special If you're going to have mediocre food you better have exceptional service Double fail.
You can expect: cold fries  gross or uncarbonated drinks  cold burgers that have been sitting there ect I usually don't write reviews but with flu  fever  and gross food I'll be going hungry tonight Save yourself a trip and go to Ellsworth.
What's not to love about Camelback Ranch I'm a Dodgers fan so of course I'm going to love it here Been coming here for the past 3 years for spring training Love the way it's set up and you get to see the players practice in the outer fields before the game starts (get there early) It's great because you get some great pics of the players Love the food Yummy lemonade Great seats anywhere and easy to get to It does get hot in Phoenix so we got up a couple times to stand under the shade Will be coming back for sure They have Dodger dogs :))) NOTE: Do not park in the dirt parking lot when you first come up on the ranch It is pretty far from the entry and when you leave at the end of the game you will be stuck in the parking lot for a LONG time Keep going down the street and you will find closer parking to the ranch Have fun.
There is not much more I can say that has not been said by previous Yelpers This place is just plain awesome We went to St Francis with another couple for dinner and we all just loved this place The open air dining room lemonade cocktail cauliflower & curry soup the pot roast on Texas toast the service - all five star and I wasn't blown away by the check Mmm I am salivating for more of the soup as I sit St Francis will the first place I think of when I want to "show off" the culinary options of Phoenix to visitors.
I have not been in the store so I can't speak on that but they have a great selection and will go out of there way to find a book  Prices are high but fair if you're looking for a 60 year old book in perfect condition you're not going to find it for the jacket price  If I ever get out to AZ I will stop by.
Can't wait to go back  I love the Monday deal it is genius  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins) we had a blast  I love the Brie Apple and Fig Prosciutto Fig and mascarpone Tomato jam bruschettas  I had the Teira Zinfandel which was perfect.
I think this place is great especially since the new owners took overMaria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendlyGood drink (GREAT MARGARITAS) and very good traditional food Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisineGreat placeThanks guys.
I heard great things about Hillside Spot from a friend I will never consider his recommendations againThe service was terrible Our waiter fucked everything up everything Forgetful messed up each order The family next to us had similar problems but worse Waiter gave all the kid's food to another table So the parents were already done eating when their kids finally received their grub The food was nothing special Maybe worth 25 stars This Spot was boo boo I've had better experiences at Waffle House.
Best wings around Being from Buffalo NY we are used to the best wings and this is it Pizza is OK.
We didn't get our normally great rate that my travel agent wife is able to secure but wanted to get away and thought to stay here anyway  What makes a resort world class or 5 star  yeah the property needs to be well cared for and of course clean but more importantly are its people  From the moment we arrived and asked for the nearest restroom their response:  it's up the escalator passed the second set of elevators to your left don't forget second set of elevators but more importantly "welcome"  and welcome I did feel every interaction after that was just as warm and pleasant  They made me feel like I expected and then some given how much their rates are  The furniture  the art the backdrop and the amenities were all high class  The kids swam in the pool slid down the slide a hundred times we shot some hoops played ping pong borrowed the bikes and watched some men shank their balls on the beautifully manicured golf course or watched tennis pros give out lessons all within the comfort of this grand resort  Camelback mountain provides a great backdrop and next time will serve as a great place to hike too for us :) We will definitely return  the service was as we say in our hood off the chain :).
The Tempe location got a nice bit of redoing and is now a lot bigger but the southern half of the place is still hilariously and charmingly small I love sitting so close to the cooksTip: they half bake pasties for the next day late at night so if you order one then it's noticeably different The super fresh 11pm cajun pasty I got after (during) my bachelor party may be the most delicious thing I've eaten The bar's got wonderfully cheap car bombs and they leave a nice note on the receipt when you get one.
I looked all over for a lamp repair store  It seemed that there were no such establishments  It then occurred to me that some of the Ace Hardware stores in Washington did light repairs so I took a chance and called the Litchfield Park store  The manager Odis told me to bring it in they would see what they could do  I did they worked on it for at least 20 minutes to a half an hour took it apart replaced a 54 cent something or other and put it back together  They charged me for the part only no labor  They were courteous helpful knowledgable and all around Boy Scouts  I haven't been so impressed by a culture of customer service in I don't know when  I felt like I had time warped back to the fifties  Thank you to Odis and Mick you made my week and saved my antique mall bargain lamp.
Worst OB office I have ever been to Originally I thought they were great but as my pregnancy progressed they were a NIGHTMAREThe receptionist girls are extremely rude both over the phone and in personThe Dr and PA do not take any health issues seriously Even after a hospital stay they still did not pay any attention to my health needs Their solution for everything is jamming medications down your throat instead of finding the root cause of the issueEven worse these medications are not safe and several of them were Category C which are known to cause birth defects After a few trips to the pharmacy where a Pharmacist told me NOT to take them a change in dr was the only solutionDo not trust your health or the well being of your baby with this office.
I sure hope my trainer Bill Crawford at Basic Training doesn't follow my reviews  I know I shouldn't be eating Bundt  Cakes but I don't care  These cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them  I recently had the blueberry one and it was really tasty  My favorite is red velvet it is rich and has cream cheesy icing on top Seriously if you need to impress thank or present someone with the best cake everthis is the place   I wish I had a wedge now.
This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Tempe especially on the weekends I've been here over ten times last year with 0 complaints My favorite breakfast is the chipotle egg burrito which includes avocado bacon cheese potatoes and more My only complaint is that too many people like NCounter and thus it is always super filled But who cares When the food is good I'm always there.
I call this place the "G" spot (and I know I'm not alone)  For good reason  It is amazingly delicious some of the best gelato I've ever had Sooooo fricking YUMMYYou can try as many flavors as you want too  So naturally I try no less than every flavor available- haha- (they are more than happy to oblige you) whenever I go  I have gotten pints to take home it's that good  It's a wonder I don't weigh 500 lbs  I try to exercise some self restraint or I probaly would be  But hey isn't gelato supposed to be better for you than ice cream Something about the density so you eat less  )Try it you won't be disappointed  I've only been to the Camelback location although I'm sure they're all good.
This is my favorite spa in the world Hopefully I'll make it to othersbut if I could only get to the Camelback Inn I'd be in heaven Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured I drink some water and as I lounge there I order a small healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast) I swim a little lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year  If I have planned it I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time I reschedule.
Sushi: 4/5 stars It's always tasted fresh but a lot of rolls are deep fried I especially like the Phoenix Roll Rock n Roll and Volcano RollService: 5/5 I have no complaints Every time I've gone with my bf we've never experienced a long wait for a drink refill or ordering off the menu Everyone has been pleasant They have the Belly card and last time I was there our server offered to take it to the register and swipe it for mePrice: 5/5 It's already very reasonable at $150-$4 for a (half) roll and up to $5 for sashimi or uni sushi but they also have happy hour where it's 50 cents off a plate I found coupons in the Clipper (from the mailbox) as well as onlineAtmosphere: 4/5 It's a mix between a sushi bar and almost a buffet but the conveyor belt is unique and a fun change of pace I wish you could leave 45 I'll give it the 5 because for what it is I can't see room for improvement There are plenty of other places that are delicious but drain my wallet I come here 1-2 times a month happy to add it to my rotation.
Today Jimmy John's ran a $1 sub special from 11 am to 3 pm  This was advertised in a Full Page Ad in the Arizona Republic  We went around noon but the line was too long and so thought we would come back closer to the ending time for the deal ie 3 pmWe were there at around 2:45 pm and they told us that they were No Longer Honoring  the Deal  No consideration was given that the customer spent their time and gas to come there with the knowledge that the deal would be honored  The FULL Page Ad in the Arizona Republic specifically said it was till 3 pm and it did not have any exceptions or restrictions whatsoeverI cannot support a local business that clearly breaks its own promise  I will never step into a Jimmy John's when there is Subway Blimpie's Quiznos Firehouse Jersey Mikes Jason's Deli and so many more options.
Have been taking my son here for almost 2 years and he LOVES it They have everything from gym classes to art and music classes During a lot of the year they have "unlimited months" so you can go however much you want So convenient clean & the staff is great If you have a son or daughter you need to try it out they are always running specials :).
Best baklava I have ever had and I have been to Greece and Turkey several times  Baklava cheesecake also to die for if they have it in  Also a different hummus every day  We love trying them all  Dinner is great and pretty big but also pretty healthy  I would highly recommend  A great neighborhood restaurant.
Oh boy  My husband needed prgressive lenses  The girl who helped () us told me we should get the "premium" progressive as opposed to the standard  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME  She figured it all out nd showed my like a car salesman on a computer a price of $171  With insurance  When I said that was a lot she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30  Good luck with that sister   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance  Hold on to the wallet here folks.
Always great Coffee is excellent fresh ingredients etc  Christopher goes out of his way to make sure everyone's experience is wonderful  We normally go here for lunch and it is always fast enough so we get back to the office on time.
First time here came on a Sunday night for dinner The inside is fairly small but cozy They have a large patio dining area with nice lights up but it's too cold for that so no one was out there They have some interesting menu items that I've never seen before My husband and I got the fig and panela cheese salad the hibiscus enchiladas (yep the flowers) and the huitlacoche crepas which is apparently a type of mushroom or fungus that grows on corn Sounds like we eat weird stuff huh Maybe so The salad had nice bite-size pieces of dried figs and cheese with a balsamic dressing The hibiscus enchiladas had a sweet/tangy flavor to them with a nice side of sauteed vegetables The crepas were soft and tangy with goat cheese and pomegranate sauce I was impressed by all three  They also bring out chips with two types of salsa Good service as well.
This place had one of the best chocolate croissants I've ever tasted outside of Paris Their chocolate is not too sweet and it has just the perfect amount of chocolate instead of one "toothpaste" squeezed shaped roll you usually find in a chocolate croissants here You have to come early cuz it is really hard to find a place to sit We were very lucky to find a large table for 6 ppl  As everyone has been telling us to try their macaroons they are worth coming for The texture of the cookie is chewy instead of flaky and crumbly  I also like the croque Madame It's so great they don't put the ham on itThank goodness for that.
We ate there because of the good reviews on yelp and were not disappointed  The chip and salsa were fresh and crisp  My cheese enchilada & tamale with rice and beans were perfect   Staff was friendly enjoyable to be there  We try a different Mexican food restaurant every Thursday night for the past nine months and we love this place.
WOW I'm so glad we found an awesome Chinese food place I was so tired of all the other dirty slow bad food places The food is delicious and they give you a lot Every time I order I have lunch and a snack for the next day The prices are really good too You will not find any other place that offers this amazing food at a great price Give up your search and step in here or order for pickup/delivery You won't regret it.
came to this place after being recommended by my mom and sistersi have had a difficulty time finding a dependable and quality nail salon in scottsdale/tempe area i finally found onethey did a SUPERB gel manicure and pedicure they really take care and time in their work and the customer service is incredible competitive prices as welli will be returning -- best nail salon i've been to by far.
Zipps One of the Valley's best happy hour if you're looking for a laid-back atmosphere I really enjoy the layout of this locationA 32-ouncer and Golden Medium wings are a must But don't underestimate the strong margaritas Yummy Burgers and AMAZING foccacias A great sports bar to watch the bigger games NFL NBA MLB and college Although my boyfriend and I feel that there are too many U of A fans (GO DEVILS).
Happy birthday to myself enjoying Bruschetta and vino tinto Great ambiance and wonderful Food.
I can't say enough positive things about this location The staff is pleasant and helpful even when I come strolling in at 430am I love that this gym is fully staffed 24 hours a day and all of the equipment is immaculately maintained Most of the machines are also equipped to where you can just plug your headphones straight into the machine to listen to TV - super awesome The locker room is so clean and spacious At my last gym I dreaded having to get ready for work in the locker room after my workout but here I have no problems They have free wi-fi as well Check them out.
I love this property  It is tucked nicely on the side of a mountain and when you enter the property grounds you feel like you checked out of Phx and stepped into a nice tropic bungalow I think the pools are beautiful and the rates aren't too terrible  The rooms are very contemporary which made it very 5-starrish  But the price of the mini-bar in the room - STAY AWAY.
I found a great Groupon for this salon and decided to give it a try because of the good reviews I found online The receptionist was super nice when I called and booked me for an appointment with Miguel the next day I was greeted right away and Miguel was ready for me as soon as I arrived I don't think I've ever not had to wait for a stylist I showed Miguel a few pictures of what I was wanting and he gave me an awesome cut and style He's a wizard with the clippers I normally walk out of a salon with really big soccer-mom hair and have to wash it and restyle it immediately but I am incredibly happy with what Miguel has done with my hair The product that he used doesn't smell awful like most products and my hair is totally touchable I highly recommend Salon 1219.
I am updating my review since I have visited the BC and had another incident that you folks should be aware of Fraud and theftMy friends and I enjoyed our lunch and we thought nothing of it We all left fair tips and went about our day Two of my friends and I threw our receipts away without verifying the correct amount had posted to our bank accounts (we all either used debit or credit cards) Our other friend balances her accounts monthly and noticed that our server had changed the tip amount after we left She made a $2 tip into a $3 tip $1 isn't a big deal but it is fraudulent behavior and it is theft I'm sure it adds up It could have happened to all four of us that day but three of us didn't do our due diligence and check our accountsMy friend contacted the BC and spoke with Gino the manager He took the information and then asked if my friend wanted her $1 back Well it's not worth driving all the way down there to get $1 I won't post the server's name but everyone beware We don't know if she will remain employed at the BC but you can never be too safe If I were the manager this behavior would not be tolerated It hurts the reputation so badly Check your receipt and your bank account after you dine here Now I certainly will not be returning.
I am so mad Reserved two 90 minute massages as treats for my fiancé and I to celebrate finishing our first half marathon showed up and the told us they were only able to get one of us in Their idea of "compensating" was taking $17 of our next massage She had no remorse for failing to let us know that they couldn't honor our reservations and was actually pretty rude all together Won't be going back their ever again.
These folks are doin' DD RIGHT.
Blue Nile was good this is better It's really good guys I was really happy after the meal in the way that only food can do if something unhappy deep inside of you has been satiated The food is super inexpensive too There's an Ethiopian menu and a Mediterranean oneThe berbere mix they use here is pretty mild but I think it's better that way I usually prefer in-your-face-spice the kind that you know will make your taste buds gush and pop If not that I at least like spicy because it's interesting and makes the other flavors taste better This berbere was neither but the subtle notes of the spices worked so well together it produced the same effect This Ethiopian guy I met once told me you can evaluate how good an Ethiopian place's food is by the berbere--it's present in so many dishes The injera was OK the most important part to me was that it wasn't soggy like it's been sitting out too long I think injera is usually more sour and the flavor didn't hold up to the food's but since the food was so good it was fine I didn't get to try the Doro Wat (they were out) but I'm going back today to try itThe Mediterranean dishes weren't super Mediterranean-y seemed like they had an African influence on them Or maybe they were Either way pretty decentTechnique doesn't matter as much as flavor for this type of food but I didn't notice anything majorly wrongAnd the owner is really nice That doesn't make the food taste better but it makes a better restaurantI've had two great meals in the last two weeks--one in a top Zagat rated restaurant in Boston (for ~$100) and here (for like $10) My only fear is that since this place is new it's in a honeymoon phase and the effort level will drop off soon.
When I need a good mexican food "fix" and I'm at work I go here It is just down the road & it has always been good I always get their chicken tacos They hit the spot Plus I gotta say their chips & salsa are pretty delicious as well Yummy food.
I've been enjoying Gina's Homemade since I came across their biscotti at the Old Town Farmer's Market back in the season of 2010-2011 They slowly began introducing other products like Gina's amazing meat sauce and their fantastic cheeses and I was officially in love Since they opened their retail shop I've stopped in when I don't feel like making dinner but I want something special and always come out with more than I intended Gina's burrata is creamy silky and just perfect The lasagna made with fresh house-made ricotta is simple and old-school No frills needed--just great cheese pasta and sauce I also love the variety of pizzas they have available and have yet to pick a favorite honestly I also like that you can complete your meal with a bottle of great wine or grab some truffle butter for well anything (I'm a sucker for good truffle butter) If you haven't gotten to Gina's yet it's worth a trip--whether it's to their cute little retail location or to one of the local farmer's markets in Phoenix & Scottsdale.
This place was a disappointment First of all the food took forever- even though my bf and I were the only ones there They have only 1 gyro on the menu C'mon now every greek restaurant should have more than 1 type of gyro My bf had the gyro and thought it wasn't bad despite the grease that poured out the bottom of his gyro when he held it up However when I order a gyro with beef only (no lamb) they didn't have it They also didn't have the beef sandwich When I ordered the Italian sandwich I was in horror when it came out It looked like soggy roast beef (that surprisingly tasted very dry due to overcooking) served in an old hot dog bun No joke the bread was an over-microwaved hot dog bun that was too hard to tear apart nonetheless bite through it It tasted as bad as it looked and I resorted to eating only my fries (which were overcooked and hard I think they re-cooked a batch that had been sitting out since lunch three hours before we came in) Who messes up fries This was a horrid eating experience that left me going straight to Mickey-D's for something more reliable Save your money people.
I am a self proclaimed "Trader Joe Hoe" lol I don't care what anyone says Trader Joes is the BEST grocery store EVER The Arrowhead location is one of the best I don't see why people are bitching about it I shop at this location on a weekly basis and sure sometimes it's a bit crowded but it's nothing unusual from Walmart Fry's ect I've been a Trader Joeaholic since my days in Los Angeles The store locations are very limited in Phoenix but I'm just so grateful they even have stores out here Trader Joes carries so many foodie friendly products no other grocery store can compare A few of my top TJ products areTrader Joes Meditteranian HummusTrader Joes Dolmas (they even beat restaurant dolmas)Trader Joes GuacamoleTrader Joes Dark Chocolate Covered CranberriesAnd the list can go on and on Trader Joes carries a lot of vegetarian products as well which is pretty nice And for everyone taking stars away from this remarkable place due to the fact that it's not near or in your darn backyard  go take a hike to the nearest preservative packed Walmart and load up on pork grinds or something sheesh Trader Joes also has a raffle if you bring a reuseable bag when you shop They always have had many lanes open when I go and the wait is never long enough for me to remember it being long The cashiers are always really friendly I love Trader Joes Always and forever 5 stars baby :).
I have know Susan for over a year and have always found her very knowledgable about any questions that I have had regarding signage  I have referred several people to her and none of them have been disappointed with what they bought.
Love this place  Everyone is friendly and the coffee is so good  They have good frozen coffee drinks and pretty decent food for a coffee shop  Good urban environment also They also have a punch card.
Fountain Hills is an oasis in the desert marked visibly by its world famous namesake Quiet and serene the town feels like a entirely different world bordering the hustle and bustle of some of the larger cities in the phoenix metropolitan area A golfers paradise Fountain Hills offers multiple highly rated courses with greens worth the drive However golf isn't the only reason to cross the border into town Local eateries provide a wide range of style price range and atmospheres to choose from In addition twice a year the town becomes a mecca of arts and crafts enthusiasts when it hosts the Fountain Hills Arts and Crafts FairWhile its reputation leans towards that of a retirement community Fountain Hills has proven a wonderful place to raise a family Tight knit school systems provide the foundation to promote long lasting relationships between students and faculty while ensuring a multifaceted education With well maintained parks local sports organizations and outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy a safe and beautiful place to participate in a variety of activities Jungle gyms and small water parks provide hours of entertainment for the whole family Fountain Hills is the well needed escape from the growing concrete jungle surrounding the phoenix area while still being tuned into the culture and vibrancy of the cities it neighbors.
Great staff newly remodeled so the rooms are greatClose enough to the 17 to be convenient and still no freeway noise.
Great place to play golf while drinking beer Very laid back cheap and inviting Usually it is not too crowded but I tend to play during the hotter months (like most Phoenicians).
OKI've found heaventhe first four channels are ESPN  Oh babyBeautiful weather  Relish's at the Pro Shop was a great lunch stop  Camelback Mountain is right outside the window  Very friendly staff.
Flavors is easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley With friendly wait staff good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong Don't be fooled by it's humble exterior it's the food you're there to enjoy I prefer to skip the buffet as I like my food XXXX-Indian-hot but I have never been disappointed at dinner In fact the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if we'll have our regular even if it's been months since our last visit My absolute favorite is the lamb vindaloo while my husband has chicken korma and my daughter goes for the chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi Don't forget the rice pudding (kheer) for dessert You won't be disappointed.
Over priced yuppie garbagePoor unknowledgable servantsGo to the farmers market.
This place sucks balls I can't believe it is still open I went here one day while I was installing a alarm system in a house around the area Took them 45 min to bring out 2 slices of pizza by that point i was going to walk out the door blandest pizza i have ever tasted i don't know how this place is still open never again horrible service horrible food.
Don't waste your time Cost might be low but they do not stand behind their products Spoke with the owner about a verbally abusive employee that lied about their products He would not do anything to fix the problem but sell me something else The owner asked me if I was handicapped because I can't plan a tree Who asks a customer that This is the most unethical company I have ever worked with I have never been more disappointed by the way I have been treated as a customer Watch out for this company Make sure you get everything in writing and don't believe what anyone tells you there Even if you talk to the owner he will stand behind his employees that can do no wrong and not remedy the lies that have been told What a horrible experience and shame that this company calls themselves a "family business" More like a big corporate machine that doesn't care about their customers.
After a weeklong vacation to Arizona and three visits to Green within that week I can say that this is the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant I have ever been toTried a few new dishes this week including the mexicali burger the artichoke gratin the buffalo wings and three flavors of tsoynamis  All were so good  The wings were delicious and amazingly "real" in texture and taste  The tsoynamis are freakin' awesome - the first one I had a few years ago I didn't really think the texture was quite right  But I definitely think its exactly like a blizzard but with better flavors like fluffer-nutter (pb banana marshmallow fluff yum)But nothing beats the old standby of a no harm chicken parm with chili fries on the side  The fries are the best fries ever and the chili is so good  The no harm parm sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it  Like I said before if they opened up in my neck of the woods I could totally be vegan.
ATTENTION LADIES WITH LONG HAIRHave long hair but want style without cutting all the length off Paul is the stylist to see then He gave me the most AMAZING haircut it has layers but not choppy it has movement and it's still longFirst off he gives a relaxing scalp massage when he washes your hair and bonus the shampoo bowl is very comfortable no achy neck afterThe building he is in is super cute very clean and if you want your nails done a facial or a killer brow wax there are other studio owners that can hook you upPaul knows how to cut AND color not something all stylists can boastSo do yourself a favor and check him out it doesn't hurt that he has a totally sweet personality too.
This place deserves the accolades  As far as I've found it is the best bar in the greater Phoenix area  The huge patio space and limited interior means that it's friendly to both smokers and non-smokers which I think has had a large part in their popularity  It also just seems to attract an interesting crowd and I think that's what really makes it differentEvery bar attracts a specific average of people  Casey Moore's tends to attract those involved in creative fields like theatre film music etc  I don't want to say this means any one thing but it really does make the place more interesting  If you are creatively inclined you are far more likely to meet someone you might actually like as a human being there and that means a lot.
This really is as good as it gets for Bkfst outside your home here in Phx LOVE their blueberry pancakes and of course the wolfpack (hash browns eggs bacon cheese) so filling Great service this morning Looks like the menu has expanded since my last visit which was ages ago Will be back soon.
This place rocks Love it.
Dear God in Heaven there is a burrito here called "The Beast" that is hands down the best burrito I've ever eaten I'm not kidding WOW Also the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten A little pricey Sure Worth it I'd say so.
Southwest bowl is the bomb Fresh food Nice service  Truly DelishHowever they need more indoor seating space and extended hours.
I recently visited the David's Bridal Paradise Valley store while visiting my future in-laws after Christmas My future mother-in-law really wanted to be involved in the dress shopping experience so I thought I would make my first shopping trip while visiting her My future sister-in-law was in town too so I thought it would be a nice chance for her to be involved too I didn't expect to find my dress as I am SUPER picky and it has taken me MONTHS to find dresses for things before My wedding isn't until October so I had 10 months and wasn't too worried When I called to make the reservation for an appt at the Scottsdale store I was diverted to the Paradise Valley store as the Scottsdale location was under renovation Not a big deal as the PV store is only 20 min away I had a terrible experience with Sierra at the PV store They had warned me that the she would have another client and I had informed my future mother-in-law and my aunt of this as well It took her about 20 minutes to come greet me at the front of the store I didn't try on my first dress until I was 45 minutes into the appointment Sierra had pulled dresses for me but I was standing there in the slip and corset top they had me put on for 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting for her and had my aunt help me into the first dress It was a Vera Wang I had been interested in but I looked like a cream puff (not David's Bridal or Sierra's fault just not a good look for me) I tried on only one of the other dresses Sierra had brought out of the 4 because I didn't like the dresses she pulled I kept waiting for her to help me however Sierra barely ever came back She only seemed to come back when she was requested and only helped me in and out of one dressI had told her exactly what I didn't want and she kept bringing stuff that had things I didn't want She was VERY NICE VERY PROFESSIONAL and handled my relatives without getting frustrated However they were frustrated with her My future mother-in-law had to pull a lot of the dresses and most of her pulls were ones I actually liked Most of Sierra's pulls were ones I did not She pulled some silhouettes that were nice but nothing that wowed me or really impressed meThe dressing room wasn't big enough for the dress much less the dress and two people The store itself looked unimpressive Sierra just was not a good match for me They didn't have the Melissa Sweet line which was my fav dress when looking through magazines but Sierra told me the Scottsdale store had the line but probably not the dress She didn't take the 2 minutes out to call and check for me but I did  They had it and accommodated a walk-in The Scottsdale store set me up with Alison and she was amazing Even though she too had another client she made me feel like her only client and she was SO sweet and nice I really appreciated her and everything she did for me Because of Alison I found my dress (turns out the Melissa Sweet I loved wasn't it either) and I ACTUALLY feel like a bride now  I recommend going to the Scottsdale Fashion Square store EVEN IF THE Paradise Valley store is closer The rooms are bigger nicer and the seating is more comfortable for your family They have mirrors IN THE ROOMS and the selection is much nicer The store appears smaller than the PV store but it is SO MUCH nicer than the PV store Trust me you won't regret skipping PV and going straight to Scottsdale  (Ask for Alison too :)).
Loooove this place Yes it's pricey but good sushi usually is The guys making the rolls were friendly The atmosphere is nice Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll Seriously try it You won't be disappointed.
While I feel as though Teme is GREATLY lacking in the car wash department I feel as though this place really is as good as you're going to find in the area (check out my review for "Clean Freak Car Wash" on 44th) Their most expensive wash is $8 $7 if you have an ASU (or any university) ID Not only does the drive-through give you everything you need you have people IN the drive-through working on your car at the same time They have people to scrub your car down in the middle and to dry it off at the end You even get a complimentary air freshenerThey really take the time to make sure every area of your car is PERFECTLY clean and dry and won't let you leave until you are happy Wash Wizard is the ONLY place I will get my car washed from here on in I might go back to Clean Freak one or two more times just to get my money's worth (I stupidly signed up for their monthly package and can't cancel it until next month) But I'll always come back to these guys.
TURN AND RUNFirstthe staff is terrible and rude They talk to you like you are 5 Second- We ordered a rose gold band to match my wife's rose gold engagement ring 3 months later we discover that the band is actually sterling silverSTERLING SILVER They charged us $700 for a sterling silver ring that may have been dipped in rose gold The receipt says ROSE GOLD CUSTOM BAND I am appalled and have filed complaints with the FTC BBB and AZ Attorney Generals Office FM may be a great jeweler as my Tucson store was awesome The manager Diana is amazing That ring I purchased in Tucson still looks amazing.
Love love love this placeAnd this is several classes in after THE WORST YOGA EXPERIENCE EVER* at Phoenix Bikram on Camelback and Central Which is 5 minutes away and I happily drive  40 to Tempe for Bikram Yoga on Guadalupe and McClintock Serious hot yoga seeking folks-incredible experience I was very leery due due my experience with "Robert" at Bikram aka "Dic-kram" at Phoenix Bikram But I am totally blissfully loving Tempe Only place to go since Dawn at Hot Yoga (16th st & Bethany) passed away Namaste Dawn.
I love Bashas donuts and Friday is buy a dozen get 6 free  Now in my office we do not need 18 donuts there is only 2 of usbut I love their custard filled aka Boston Creme donutsYum Yumand they are sooo goodLet face it who wants a donut with a little creme filling Well you do not have to worry about getting only a little dollop  These donut will not leave you disappointed.
Inta Juice is a great place  I have been taking my kids here since they opened  I have gotten to know the owners by name (Tom and Anita)  They know my daughter by name as she is the one that comes with me most frequently  We all like the "Lime Your Mine" smoothie as well as the "Fruit Kiss"  I agree with Merle that I go out of my way to support the nonchain food establishments  I get a shot of wheatgrass everytime I go there  It has become an acquired taste for me  This place is great  If you want a smoothie go here.
Had another amazing meal here Some more recommendations include the Gulf Crab Dippair it with the Pinot Grigioand you have perfection Also my husband ordered the Cajun Prime Rib which I had a few tastes ofdeliciouseven nicer if you order it with the Shrimp My main meal and the dessert were the same as last timeand I think if it is possible the Rhubarb and Strawberry Cobler has managed to improve and taste even better than the last time.
Wonderful and warm people excellent service great trip this is the team to go diving with You are always taken care of with Scuba Specialties.
I usually poke fun at Olive Garden as having bland food for people that have no idea what Italian food should really taste like yet I'd still choose them over Nick's I've read and respect the other reviews and perhaps we just caught a bad night but Nick's was awful We began with a service issue however that was minor and not worth repeating That problem would have been easily overlooked if the meal was good Instead we got uninspired bland food that seemed like it came right out of the jar or box The are too many quality choices in the area or not too far from he that are much better I would not go back to Nick's.
Whoa  Whomever has been keeping this place a secret---shame on youThis deli was recommended by a friend and my wife told me about it when I wanted to go out for dinner instead of the ol' mac-n-cheese the kids were having  I was extremely hesitant as "deli" means different things to different people  For most places in Arizona it means "sure we've got processed meat"The Deli in Queen Creek is nothing of the sort  It is family-owned goodness  I was caught browsing the menu outside and immediately upon entering was greeted by regulars who said 'you won't be disappointed' -- What a compliment  A very friendly staff greeted me and I chose to take home the Cuban sandwich and the hot pastrami  First let me tell you the portions are more than generous  That's the sign of a good deli  The Cuban was fantastic  The pastrami was no slouch either but when put against the Cuban it was hard to measure upThis little place out in the south side of QC probably won't be quiet for long  The atmosphere inside is very welcoming for a nice night out with friendsThe specials they advertised the weekend I cam in seemed a little high for the type of restaurant but the sandwich prices were reasonable  They advertise fresh/local ingredients and it tasted like it -- it was fabulousI can't wait to go back with friends.
Wow  I loved the bobby  This thing was so amazing  If you ever want to fix your thanksgiving craving go to Capriottis  Thankfullybthwy had a yelp deal or I probably wouldn't have tried this place  YUMMY.
I've been driving across town from Pinnacle Peak area to see Dr Weinacker at this clinic for the past 4 of the 10 years I've lived in AZ I sure wish I'd known about him sooner because in my part of town all the vet clinics price gouge the heck out of you I have ten animals 3 dogs and 7 cats so I can't afford to start with expensive procedures and kenneling my animal overnight for 'observation'  for minor issues as many of the vets in my part of town want to do For example in my part of town a Valley Fever blood test  runs about $170 The same blood test plus thyroid/kidney panel at PVAH was about one quarter the cost Had I had just the Valley Fever test alone done it would have been considerably less than $170 When Dr Weinacker saw the receipt from my former vet in my account records he quipped that he should raise his prices DON'T YOU DARE  I greatly appreciate that he tries to keep my costs down by recommending lest expensive procedures first He knows he's going to be kept in recreation vehicles by my menagerie alone just kiddingDr Weinacker is a big tall man with an exuberant personality My dogs love this and respond in kind Some of my cats are a bit more reserved and may not be used to his exuberant style but it also serves to keep them docile while getting treated since they don't know himloves animals and some animals  but he sure keeps my female Heeler drama queen occupied while treating her and that's not easyI can't recommend this clinic highly enough.
$20 for a double Maker's Mark  Me thinks not TGI McPappadeaux  I was not impressed by anything that was there and will not only steer clear but may avoid the I-17 all together.
Pizza escarole salad and lasagna are perfection Sauce is unbelievable.
I just don't understand how this place would get anything less of 5 stars After reading some of the reviews on here I am so disappointed at what the main complaints are I guess some people are used to going to an over the top sushi place in Scottsdale where you get your ass wiped for you I mean seriously get over yourselves people Kabuki is THE BEST I love the veggie roll there the avocado and pretty much anything vegetable My boyfriends favorite is the Alaskan Dynamite Philadelphia and sushi tempura I have tried other sushi places (Stingray Sushi Brokers etc) and I can honestly say that nothing compares Friday night and Saturday nights yes it gets busy yes you may have to wait get over it If it's busy and it takes a few minutes for your alcoholic drink to arrive so be it it's JUST a drink I love coming to Kabuki I love that they offer the Red Mask Club so you can get coupons in the mail and over all I love the Reverse Happy Hour Buy one get one for a dollar Yes please :).
This is a great place if you love good beer  And life is too short to drink bad beer  They have a great selection of bottles that you can purchase and drink in the bar or take out in a mixed 6 pack  They also have a rotating menu of beer on draft   This is not a bud light drinker's bar They have great pizzas also.
I like this place It's clean the staff is helpful and they have a lot of toppings to choose from  This was my first Time here I have no complaints.
On my last trip to Arizona I noticed there was a Grimaldi's in the area  Of course I was doing very important research and had to check it out to see if was up to par with the one in Vegas  The service was friendly and very accommodating  Our waitress was very attentive and prompt with our every request  Refills were abundant and as usual the pizza was amazingI ordered my favorite combination:  Italian sausage ricotta cheese and fresh basil (after cooking)  The pizza was every bit as good as I remembered it in Vegas  There was nothing missing not even a hint of imperfection  Damn I love this pizza  Sure it's a bit pricey  But to me you just can't put a price on delicious pizza  Grimaldi's has pizza down to a scienceThe waitress also hinted that a California location was a possibility  I sure hope so  CA people are missing out.
I have been to a number of dentists and I was not pleased by this placethey kept us waiting for over an hour then didn't even get to finishing my husband's teeth They said they would reschedule him for the following weekend then cancelled and never reconfirmed his appointment When I tried to do it for him they wouldn't let me So disappointed.
this place is amazing  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread beer wine and cheeses  i was very impressed with the quality of their food espresso and cleanliness of their store  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts cards and books and other unique stuff   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices this place is very hard to beat  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle.
I just bought a queen trust firm mattress from Justin at Mattress firm He was very helpful and knew a ton about the mattresses he was selling The mattress I ended up with is great and sleeping on it has been wonderful.
Holy Delicious Food Batman Headed over to Grassroots on a whim while in town Stopped in on a Tuesday with the Husband and kids (13 & 8 - both kids are super adventurous eaters so I had no worries) It was busy but they got us in on a high top in the bar I know I'm going to love a place when the menu starts to blur because every single thing looks amazing We started with the Pork Belly (my husbands favorite food on the planet) Pork Belly with candied prosciutto  It was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten Could have stopped there and been perfectly happybut whyWe ordered short ribs (husband) shrimp and grits (me) seared ahi (Big) and chicken with hearts of romaine (Little) All of them were absolutely spectacular The short ribs were melty and delicious and fabulous The BBQ sauce was heavenly and the meat was ridiculously tender The shrimp and grits were nothing short of amazing I could have just done the bowl of jalapeño cheese grits on its own without the shrimp  The Ahi was Devine The agave ponzu was sweet and delicious and I'd like a bottle of it to use at home Or to drink whichever The hearts of romaine was yummy and Little cleaned her plate We finished off the meal (already stuffed) with a banana split that was creamy gelato topped with candied pecans Just yummy and wonderfulCan't wait to get back to Scottsdale to enjoy this place again Just a GREAT GREAT meal.
This place is great I have had a few pedicures in my time and this one is the best I'm a stickler for the calf/lower leg massage They added a hot stone to it which made the whole experience I might have to come back on my own terms and not with my wife Great place to go.
My favorite dog park in the valley Lots of great owners and dogs Let's start with just getting to the park I've never seen the parking lot full even on the busiest of weekends when softball games are going So great parking The park has 3 different areas 1 area is always closed to regrow grass which is nice There is an active area and a passive area Entrances are double gated and also have separate gates for if you are leaving or coming inside Once you are inside the grounds are maintained pretty well I've seen a few times that mud puddles have started from over watering but that is very very rare Each area has its own little play area One has a small selection of agility training objects 1 has a series of tubes that your dog can jump up and go through the tubes and the last area has a series of boulders to jump on Dog owners are attentive and pick up after their pets Although you will see the occasional poop in the grass So watch your step Also on the active side I've been happy to see some knowledgeable dog owners who know the difference between play fighting and an actual dog fight My dog is the most playful dog I've ever seen and enjoys doggy boxing leading to a game of chase The only negative thing about the park is the water fountain Water pressure is horrible and also there is only 1 fountain in each area On nights and weekends when it is super busy there is a giant crowd of dogs trying to get some water.
Absolutely my favorite place in town Best bruschetta EVERRR Oh and when you go ask for Miles -- he's the most amazing server ) and quite handsome too I might add.
Not much to say I absolutely love this Fry's The associates are always kind and professional They always remind you to use your Fry's card Produce is always fresh Prices compared to Albertson's are obvious savings.
I'm surprised this place doesn't have more lower rated reviews We should have sat in the patio because couldn't see our menus or even our food indoors Seemed every table was using their flashlight iPhone app I complained on deaf ears Chicken was dry food presentation nice (if only we could see the food on the plates) but lacked much else Way overpriced for what you get (tiny servings) Best thing was the side of beans (amazing) Next time will try the place across the street.
Some of the best veggi/vegan food around & def the best here in AZ Are you unsure of what meat substitutes are or taste like  Green really nails it& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll (so delicious) or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ  Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard) cupcakes coffee & more SO GREAT +++.
Freaking amazing A MUST tryI had the Prosciutto Wrapped Hawaiian Ono again AMAZING This place is awesome can't say enough great things about it The staff did an exceptional job Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions would recommend two if your creating a mealThe prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35 couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others.
This review is not in reference to Bink's food or service it is in reference to being lied to by Bink's employees My family stopped by for lunch yesterday with our new tiny poodle puppy in tow and requested seating on the patio Our puppy all of 3 pounds would stay on my lap the entire time We were told no only service dogs allowed on the patio due to "health codes" Now I 100% support a cafe owner's right to make their own policies regarding dogs on patios but it angers me to be lied to because (as a dog owner) I know for a fact there are no "health codes" locally in Carefree or state-wide about this within five minutes of Bink's turning us away we were seated on the patio at Carefree's sundial cafe surrounded by family's with dogs about to have lunch Kevin man up and tell your employees not to condescend to the public and tell the truth about your policies.
I've driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to stop in and see what the heck was going on in there  I had heard they had food to go or something like that  I discovered they had a few tables and I could eat in so I ordered the turkey meatloaf with side of mashed sweet potatoes and a side of garlic kale  Faithful Companion had a salmon cake with a side of garlic kale and a side of butternut squash chunksThe food was very fresh and well prepared  All the veggies were al dente and seasoned just enough  The two entrees were also very well done and neither left any oily residual on our plates  And all of that for 12 bucks and change Wow I'm going back as soon as I get hungry again maybe tonight about 3AM.
I spontaneously went to China City Super Buffet with the intention of trying something new  Ironically the experience that I received was far from what I was looking forAfter finding this location in the hood I was promptly seated and went for my first tour of the buffet  After discovering that the first plate was not clean I grabbed another and loaded up on some sushi  It wasn't great sushi but it wasn't bad either it just didn't taste that fresh  On my second trip I grabbed some mixed rice orange chicken beef and some cooked shrimp (with the head on)  Everything was quite lukewarmFortunately I was still using the chopsticks that I used for my sushi as I sifted my way through the rice  Then I found the special surprise of the day in my rice: AN INSECT LEGNow I'll gladly admit that I'm not an expert when it comes to bugs  I've seen plenty in my day from cockroaches to bees and even crickets  So I can't say for sure which kind of insect that this leg came from but I am absolutely sure that it didn't belong in my food  After discreetly taking pictures I called for the manager and showed her the evidence  She tried to act like the two-jointed leg was a black thread as she held it up to her black shirt  Good try lady- I may look dumb but I am not stupidLong story short I will not return and only recommend this place if you are really open to wanting any kind of extra protein in your diet  Two photos of the leg are attached for your viewing pleasure.
I had lunch there on Wednesday and I still cannot believe it was as amazing as it was Justin Y is dead on it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco The rolls are fun inspired and unique The seaweed isn't overpowering The portions are perfect Their lunch menu is awesome 4 pcs Hamachi 4 pcs Salmon 1 philly roll a daquari and edamame 2700 out the door  Great value in my book especially for something so fresh The guys at the bar are men of few words but they crank out quality I'm still beside myself with joy.
This place has a great atmosphere perfect for dates groups and girl's night I came with my parents for a family dinner We came on a Friday night without a reservation in mid-July and had only a 15-20 minute wait We got drinks at the bar and hung out At some of the tables in the bar area you can seat yourself if they're open A waiter came and let us know which was really nice of him We ended up being beat to the table but we weren't worriedI enjoyed a pomegranate martini It was delicious and I love that they bring you a chilled glass about halfway through Totally unnecessary but TOTALLY appreciated We shared the spinach/artichoke dip as an app Yummy I had the bleu cheese crusted filet which was perfectly prepared Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place Mom had some kind of salad and it was huge When she was done she barely looked like she touched it We tried the White chocolate banana cream pie it was a little weird Came on a crust that looked like a cookie Dad said it was okay but then I noticed a very small hair on the whipped cream We quietly told the waitress who immediately apologized and offered another Since we weren't impressed we declined She comped the desert and our appetizerFood was great drinks were great desert was just fine Service is where WCG shined We were really impressed with the way the waitress and the manager treated this hair Probably 4 apologies total It was nice to NOT be blown off for a small complaint or made to feel like we were making a big dealI would definitely return Yumm.
My go-to place for a special occasion The seafood towers are incredible the steaks are perfect and they make one of the best cosmopolitans around.
Excellent beer and wine selection  I love that you can buy a single bottle of beer - if you want to just try something out you don't have to commit to a six-pack  Great prepared foods section - I had a hard time choosing between a sandwich soup build-your-own salad pizza and sushi (just to name a few of your options)  I opted for the sushi and was not disappointed  Fresh fish made to order  I'll definitely be returning.
Nice staff.
Love home smoked quality BBQ Tired of chain joints that cost too much for gimmicky food Andrew's will blow you away in a smokey cloudNothing fancy: the way barbeque was meant to be served You go up and order at a counter in front of an massive open kitchen where you can see their smokehouse and talk to the pit masters as they work You sit down at simple wooden tables with a roll of paper towels in the center and your choice of home-made BBQ sauces You get served in baskets or trays covered in checked picnic paper You eat with businessmen and doctors shoulder to shoulder with landscapers and the smelly and bearded Everyone (besides those damn vegatarians) love Andrew's And why not Grade-A Kansas City Q being served up without any frills and bullsh*t Just what the valley neededThe fact that you're still reading this review means you've waited too long to go You owe it to yourself to put the best BBQ in AZ in your mouth Get in your car and go You'll thank me later.
I've been a fan of Simply Bread for awhile (Drip Coffee Lounge serves their bread) I had yet to stop in to the bread bar because they carry the same hours I do (9-5 M-F) I can tell you it was well worth it Very friendly and happy to give samples I bought a loaf of "The Don" and the chocolate chip cookies perfect.
Not good at all  Two beer selections on tap and only one bottle of the beer I decided on in the entire place  The meal was fatty and not tender  We overheard a server mention that it was under new management but that was over a year ago  This place needs help.
Just about my favorite place in Arizona I love to run bike or walk around at this park They also have boat rentals which I recommend Great for a picnic or having ice cream with friends The view at sunset is breathtaking They have events like beer fests marathons and concerts throughout the year And the best fireworks in the area for the Fourth of July If you love the outdoors and haven't been here you are missing out.
First time live down the street and decided to stop in for a beer  The comdedian on Monday nights was talking about carrying weapons and how funny that is  The bartender was dressed in a tie but don't let it fool you he's not polite  At one point he was threatening me with violence to leave the establishment  No reason  But beware this place feels creepy and sketchy  The beer was okay but a bit over priced and less than I would expect from a gambling establishment  My take on the place there is no way I would cross their threshold again.
The short: Pricey eclectic Japanese food Wish I lived in town I'd come backThe long: This place is located in heritage square and is set up in an old house Despite this the inside is very clean and they make the small space work The seating is cozy and intimate without being cramped The second thing you notice waiting for you table is the crazy imported Japanese beer offerings in the drink menu Personally I'm a beer snob and tried as many beers as possible They have a sweet potato lager and an oyster stoutWe came with enough people to try most items on the menu When I was there they had sticky rice with pork belly sashimi ceviche goat cheese cheesecake  It was all really goodThis place is really hipster/trendy I'm thinking the background music was Pandora with a Cold War Kids seedThe only real negative is the price But everything is spectacular The service is great they're all friendly they know the menu in and out The food is delivered right on time The food is great varied and will definitely surprise you They even throw in a trick candle if its someone's birthdayI normally grade pretty hard This is the first place I've given a 5.
We recently visited Saba's for dinner for the first time  The food is prepared fresh and many of the dishes were created by the owner George  We enjoyed visiting with George and learning of the long history of the family owned restaurant The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff very attentive We really enjoyed our menu selections and have many more dishes to look forward to  We'll definitely recommend Saba's.
This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart No sirree Bob if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water steamed buns and French's mustard you may want to keep drivingHowever if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook then this is your place Hot dogs with gouda cheese bacon and even peanut butter as toppings I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed themAdditionally at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as wellFinally the service was great Despite the crowds service was friendly attentive and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucksShort Leash Dogs - we will be back.
I dine out regularly and found my experience at Chelsea's to stand out above the rest The food was very fresh and prepared just as I had asked The fresh tuna tacos ROCK We also sat on the patio which I have to say is the best patio setting in town The staff were friendly and made our experience more enjoyable The energy inside the restaurant was upbeat and everything seemed to flow well I'm definitely going back.
This could be the worst food I have ever had The fact that people wait in line for this defines that many people either do not have any taste buds or simply do not care how there food taste My wife and I both ate one bite out of the meals and that was it Unless you are only trying to feel a void this is the last place to come Sorry farm house need to work on the food.
I love love love the Spa LamarI go whenever I get a chance They have a great deal The first Wednesday of every month you take a friend and get HALF OFF both of your services thats a deal if you ask me The staff is always amazing and professional I never want to leave Every person I have taken there has gone back and loves it.
Yard House the yin to my wallet's yang Beer selection: awesome Beer and food prices: highI'm a huge fan of draft beer While some like to play with Belgian lambics I'm still in the hoppy stages of youth swimming in IPAs and west coast bitters They have around 10 different IPAs to choose from and their beer menu awesomeness is well-documented in other reviews For all the shortcomings the number of high-quality beers and tasty food has my review eternally pegged at five starsSo let's talk about what I don't like Prices I know I've said it twice but it is the only reason we don't visit more often We once had an appetizer come out unforgiveably dirty But it didn't bother us because once we told our waiter no less than two servers and a manager came to apologize If they make a mistake they more than compensate and obviously care a great deal about customer serviceHere are some of the other things I like The turkey burger is to die for We've ordered it twice and will probably order it every second or third time we visit The fries are tasty crispy and wonderful but because they are thin the temp drops quickly We try to eat the fries before the burger but it's difficult because the burger is just so darn tastyMy wife isn't crazy about the pizzas I would order them again although I will never say it is the best pizza I've ever tried I think we've only tried cheese pepperoni and bbqBut the turkey pot pie The mac and cheese (with chicken and bacon their top seller) The Maui chicken The Avocado Swiss burger Yeah those are the best I've ever had Here are some more details: pot pie is huge covered with the tastiest flakiest croissant crust imaginable The mac and cheese is legendary a must try The Avocado Swiss burger was juicy had half of an avocado and the creamiest of swiss cheeses What I liked about the Maui chicken was that it was prepared not thrown together The vegetables were really cooked in a delicious sauce and instead of drowning in sauce they were imbibed with it Just perfectionObviously we will be going again Love it Can't get enough.
This place is legit Straight-up dive pool hall And I LOVE itI came here with a friend for the first time last week to shoot some pool The place was pretty busy and it seemed to have a good amount of regulars One guy even offered to help us out since it was our first time there Get here early if you want a 8-foot table Best part - to get a rack for a table is only $3 for the entire nightWe showed up around 10 and since the tables were taken we jumped on a 7 foot table and played a few The drinks were good and cheapish and the bartender was really friendly- always adds a star in my book I'll definitely be back here.
Real simple chicken or beef or both and how much ¼ 1/2 or whole pound or birdI've never left with a bad experience and never left hungryThe pickled red onions are the best part of the meal  the great thing is if you want authentic Mexican food here it is if you are an uninetiated gringo this is a great place to start.
I had a terrible experience with Sterling Auto Body in Peoria After I was involved in a front end collision I had my vehicle towed to Sterling at the recommendation of my insurance company I was told that because they were a direct repair network shop the tow would be free  They ended up billing my insurance company $80 for the tow  After about three weeks I got a call that my car was done  As I drove it home I realized how dangerous the car was to drive The brakes were not adjusted properly after the car was put back together If someone test drove the car before they called me they would have realized how dangerous the car was to drive I immediately took the car back The second time I picked my car up I noticed that the bumper was not lined up correctly and it had a rattle when I drove  The bumper was fixed but I was told the rattle was normal because my car was "older" (2007 with less than 25K miles) After I picked up my vehicle the third time I took it to Firestone and explained that I had a rattle under the hood  They immediately noticed that a couple of aluminum plates on the fire wall were overlapping and fixed it for free on the spot  I had also pointed out to Sterling that the engine had a shake it did not have before the accident  Again I was told this was normal and it would probably smooth out over time  I took the car to my mechanic who discovered a hairline crack in a motor mount After several weeks of going back and forth with Sterling my insurance company and my mechanic the car is now fixed and running greatDealing with Sterling was extremely frustrating and I would not recommend them to anyone I care about  They dismissed my concerns as being too critical  I had to take my vehicle to two other shops in order to get my vehicle running the way it should have the first time I picked it up from Sterling.
Don't eat here unless you want to become violently ill  My boyfriend made the mistake of eating the salsa that was sitting out on the table  Now I have the joy of taking care of him because he has a really bad case of food poisoning as a result  Great way to ruin a vacation.
When I am in this part of town and want amazing food Awesome service and friendly faces CK's is where I want to go Sad to say that Tommy Pierucki is no longer there and has moved on to bigger and better things but he will always be credited with spreading the word to me and others about this amazing restaurant.
Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZINGI even turned my 'meat & potato's' husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  'just to please me'He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockworkWe are both addicted I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken ParmMy only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale(hint-hint).
BLEH Never go there Loud TERRIBLE SERVICE.
Burnt bitter espresso Bitterly disappointing This place has so much potential the pasties look yummy I ordered my usual an iced triple soy latte to jolt me awake and fend off the morning headache (Not iced in the winter)This was not drinkable I will not be backFair Trade Cafe Lux AJs(even Starbucks) I am so sorry I cheated on you.
This place is amazing  We eat there once a week and more often than not are accompanied by family and friends  The food is incredible very fresh creative and tasty  Whatever the special is order it  It's always good and I have found myself requesting a former item that was on special even though it is not on the menu  That's the other wonderful thing about SakeBombers: the service  The staff is wonderful  They have never steered me wrong with a recommendation and do not hesitate to accommodate any special requests that we have made   Yoshi server/bartender is always very friendly and welcoming  Their happy hour is amazing - $150 for delicious miso soup  SakeBombers blows other sushi out of the water.
After years of spending hundreds of dollars a week in dry cleaning I discovered Montecarlo Cleaners about 5 years ago  I love this place  I was a little hesitant at the beginning I couldn't believe they were charging only 199 per piece no matter what piece  I gave it a try and I was impressed  In five years I  have only had one incident with a piece being damaged however the owner himself Frank gave me a call and paid for my husband's shirt  They raised the price to 225 a piece now but it is still an awesome deal compare to other places  I don't understand why you have to charge almost $10 for a dress to be dry cleaned  I will gladly recommend this place to anyone.
If it's possible my love for Postino has only increased I decided to throw a baby shower for my friend here and it turned out beautifully I never had a problem with my calls being returned and the managers I spoke to were extremely helpful and friendlyWe had our shower at the front of the restaurant which utilized both indoor and outdoor couches We had the space for 2 hours plus they let us come in early to decoratePricing is wonderful for a larger party If you have the party inside the restaurant like we did regular menu pricing applies You could have it out on the lawn using the catering menu pricing which is an even better deal I also love that they don't charge for bringing in a cake You can order cookies through their sister restaurant Churn which is a great dessert optionI fed a party of ten 4 bruschetta boards a cheese board bottle of wine and "mass-mosa" (bottle of champagne + OJ carafe) for ~$10 a person plus tip I pre-ordered some paninis too but ended up cancelling them at the last minute and our waitress was very nice about itOverall it was a fun beautiful day and our baby shower went very smoothly I would host another party here in a heartbeat.
Really great flavors This guy is a mix master- comes up with some neat combinations Try it- i'm not even a Snow Ball lover and I liked it So did hubby and niece   Inexpensive and large sizes too.
Worst service ever Rude Don't explain anything and expect you to carry a huge bowl and an additional plate.
Such nice people -- all whom I met  Carrie especially  Good selection of healthy plants OK parking convenient to SR51   A nice experience -- especially after the cold shoulder that Willfill manages to show time and again.
This was my first time to go to Claim Jumper and after hearing all the hype from my friends and girlfriend I decided to finally go They seated is promptly it was 10 at night so not busy For the appetizer we got spinach artichoke dip which was amazing The chips were warm and it tasted awesome For main course our server recommended the tenderloin tips So we ordered that and the baby back beef ribs The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and it was on a bed of mashed potatoes That was awesome The vegies that came with it were covers in butter so I liked them The ribs had a great sauce with them and tasted good but would try their chicken instead next time All in all great food service and atmosphere Will be back soon an want to try a desert next time.
Let me start off by saying THIS WAS THE BEST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE I am appalled (In a good way) So my mother is always going on and on about "Pollo Campero" and makes it her mission to take me to lunch there today I've seen this establishment a few times while driving on Thomas Rd but never put much thought into having a meal thereWe arrive at "Pollo Campero" and right away the smell makes me savagley hungry Their menu included many sides from ceaser salads to white rice mixed with black beans While seeming like a very much Mexican themed restaurant i was surprised they served "yucca frita" and "platanos fritos" (fried plantanes) which are traditionally found in Central and South American dishes as well as Carribean dishes Every side dish was nothing like a fast food restaurant the rice and vegtables tasted just like it was home made (amazing) I must emphasize this again THE SIDE DISHES ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY I ordered the "5 Dollar Meal" which includes two pieces of chicken (grilled or fried) and two sides  and a dinner roll or tortillas I felt bad about paying so little for such a large and freshly prepared meal The ceaser salad was half of the plate and so crisp and fresh :)Another thing I have never been treated so well at a fast food restaurant in my life Again I cannot emphasize this enough The owner even came out and gave us coupons for our next visit after asking us if there was anything they can do for us The cashier lady walked over to our table to give us crayons and a coloring book for my little nephew When we left the entire staff waved goodbye Now tell me that doesn't sound like a cheesey Pleasantville skit only it's trueThe restaurant was decorated great with different pictures of landscapes on the wall The music was of excellent taste as well mixing different latin music from different regions of Latin American The restaurant was very clean and organized I give this restaurant a full 5 stars and recommend everyone to try it out sometime you will be amazed as well :) I guess this made me officially a "regular"(Quick recommendation: Opt for the grilled chicken you will never taste chicken the same ever again goodness :) ).
Horrible service I went for dinner and barely even made it to a chair There was no line at all but it still took the hostess a minute to get to us because she had some very important business to attend to on her cell phone When she was done texting or snap chatting or whatever we requested a patio seat because the weather was nice She pointed backward and let us know the "back bar" was open And that's how we were seated So my boyfriend and I wandered back while the hostess did not budge We arrived at what we assume was the "back bar" and sat for a couple minutes at a table near the bar in plain view of a bartender A server never appeared and the hostess left a bad taste in our mouths so we left and went to z tejas around the corner where we were actually seated and waited on Imagine that.
Excellent food Excellent service and great ambience Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona.
Tried several dishes for the first time loved them all I spent a lot of time in the far east and this is as good Today went for the dim sum kathie and I ate alot and the bill was less than $20 I would have paid double.
Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like "it's goodfor the area" but this place is just plain good I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai placesThat being said I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild ThaigerMy husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool For our appetizer we had the seafood pancake I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts scallions shrimp mussels and squid It was delicious and really unique For dinner I ordered the Decha Boar The description listed it as being perfect for the "true Thai foodie" With a description like that I had to order it The dish was spicy and flavorful I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods Different chiles effect people differently My husband ordered the Ginger Fish The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack I could've taken a bath in it Long story short: it was SO good I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors Check this place out.
A Big Breakfast with a small menuNote: this review is for the vegetarian optionsSmall cute restaurant in the middle of a neighorhood area that ALWAYS seems to have a line Words of advice- WAIT IN THE LINE Service- we sat at the bar which isn't huge (I think there were between 12-15 stools) and the  server was very friendly very helpful and very nice Our food was brought out promptly water was refilled before we could get close to finishing and we were checked up on every 5 minutes 5 starsAtmosphere- Really cute place that's always full It's not huge but it's not tiny either Everyone seems to be in a good mood and its a wonderful BRUNCH location It's fairly loud so not a quiet date location but great to come with 1 person for good food or with a small group for brunch at the tables 4 starsFood- And now for the best part The food They have a small menu which I don't mind because everything is well thought out and creative The cheese omelet (with Wisconsin cheddar of course) was well-cooked didn't have too much cheese to make it goopy and went very well with the sauteed onions The made-from-scratch Belgian waffle was DIVINE Every bite was delicious and the REAL maple syrup it's served with is delicious Don't drench the waffle so you can taste the amazing batter itself and the syrup to compliment it 5 starsDrinks- ORDER THE FRESH HONEY LEMONADE Wonderfully refreshing on a hot day fresh homemade taste and sweetened with honey to add that kick at the end 4 STARSBottom line- come early wait in line with good company try 1 thing with syrup 1 without and order the lemonade Go home happy.
The only place where movies are the most important thing in the world A legitimate 1990's dingy poorly lit video rental store Amazing.
I had been waiting with great anticipation for Five Guys to open when I first read the news last year  Five guys is one of the few things I missed about living in Virginia and my first meal there on the day they opened was totally worth the wait  Some points to consider: They aren't cheap They aren't fancy or foo-foo  They only serve a few things  But everything they serve is fantastic and well worth the price  For those complaining about the burger being too big get the little version For those complaining about it being unhealthy go buy a salad elsewhere For those complaining about it being expensive consider the sheer volume of food you're getting for the money  They don't nickel and dime you with extra toppings or add-ons you pay one price and get anything you want and enough to split between two people if you're not able to take it down yourselfThese folks are spreading the dream folks.
Brought my 2010 F-150 Platinum into them for two issues  The rear end was  clunking and the sun roof would not function  I had a 100000 mile bumper to bumper extended warranty that I had purchased from the dealer I purchased the truck from They did the work on the truck but would not release the truck back to me until the warranty company paid them  When I inquired about it  they told me they had to argue with the warranty company to get things covered because I was within 40 miles of the dealer where I purchased the truck  It would have been nice to get a call from Ford of N Scottsdale letting me know the issue  They chose to not inform me of any issues and instead inconvenience me by holding my truck  This will be the one and only time I set foot in this dealerDo not get your vehicle serviced here.
II highly recommend this place very professional and family oriented.
This place deserves a visit  You love Mexican  I love Mexican  but face it we've both been lazy haven't we  we go to the 'berto's places we have our favorite Tex-Mex neighborhood joints  and maybe we got a wild hair and went to La Parilla Suiza for a different style of Mexican food  but we haven't pushed the envelope and it's time we did  so get yourself over to Sunnyslope and try Los Reyes de la Torta  First of all brace yourself you will not get chips and salsa  and when you look at the menu you won't see your fave burritos or tacos offered  get over it  your mouth is about to be the happiest part of your body  they offer a wide variety of "tortas" (sandwiches to you gringo) and like any good sandwich place you order them with "The Works"  At Los Reyes that means a whole pile of ingredients and they're all suicculent  Agua Fresca  Just say yes and name a fruit within moments a giant margarita style glass will be placed in front of you containing a smoothie based on aforementioned fruit plus a giant garnish of same  I ordered the Mango version and cannot remember ever sipping  a more satisfying delicious concoction which went perfectly with my torta choice the Del Rey torta large enough to pose a serious challenge to Adam Richman on Man vs Food  In my case Food won but the torta containing pork ham beef eggs guacamole onions tomatoes cheese chorizo and yes even a hot dog was a glutton's wet dream  I suggest you come with a group of at least 6 people so you can order a bunch of different things and share them aroundTry this place.
Omgosh best burger in town By far The milkshakes are to die for The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the service was excellent I can't wait to come back.
Yum Another wonderful evening at Amano's Great food friendly staff and in case you didn't know Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle wine night We shared a fabulous Cabernet from their Great selection Hmmm See you next Tuesday.
We are not worthy So today I finally convinced my boyfriend to try to this place He is not a fan of enclosed food items But we were sold here Clean placeFriendly staffI get the fact that he primarily does catering and markets It's his business and it's awesome I am just thankful it's down the road and if I need one I can get one nowThe goods I had the Combo2 Mini Sweet Pies-Lemon Cream( uh lemon is my favorite so this was obviously delicious)-Spiced Apple( this one convinced the boyfriend to buy some to take home)1 Salad-Celery Root/Apple/ FarroI had no clue what farro was but I will eat it againThe PIEGreen Chile BOMB SO GOOD I loved the cliantro white sauce that came with it REALLY REALLY GOODThe boo ended up having a green chile pork and a bleu and buffalo He liked the green chile but was all about the buffalo Overall great place Good Owners Tasty food.
i can't believe how age and wear and tear grind on the body i use to be able to do this i thought much better i had an online coupon so i took my wife for some indoor rock climbing she had never been and is terrified of heights so i thought why notthe staff was friendly and casual and after a brief orientation video we were given a more hands on orientation by another staff member although i "knew the ropes"hahahahamy wife did not and since she would be my belayer i wanted her to know what she was doing the hands on orientation is very fast my wife started to glaze over as soon as she heard "carabiner" but she was able to attend and after several climbs i was without broken bones the gym is huge and full of difficult and not-so-difficult climbs we never had to wait for a rope there are storage areas for your stuff but no lockers they rent shoes chalk bags harnesses everything and if i'm not mistaken teach classes as well always fun for me and i hope my wife still loves me after making her climb a wall with rocks bolted in it with nothing but me holding on to her.
I have used McFarlands for quite sometime now and I have always been impressed They do a great job on rug cleanings and repairs I have taken dozens of rugs to them over the years and always  pleased with the quality of work They are pretty affordable too Would recommend to anyone.
Don't stay here unless you are single and under 30  You could hear conversations from the pool through the sliding glass windows and every noise (including knocks on other guest room doors) from the hallway  We stayed over night on a Saturday night and there was lots of "Night Life" all around us  It was not worth the $150 - $180 per night plus the $19 per night resort fee  Thankfully we purchased a free night for a charity event otherwise I would have another complaint.
I am hard to please  That said I am always elated when I dine at Chipotle--any Chipotle  And since I've been to this location a little more often than the others I choose to review this location  I am amazed at the quality of the meal--fresh ingredients plenty of meat clean interior--modernity at it's best  The prices are ridiculous--six and change for a huge fresh-Mex burrito with steak or chicken or pork  I just wanted to chime in on how much I appreciate 'em.
This review is solely for the employee whose name tag read "syd the kid" On Friday she wore a purple headband She is by far the worst restaurant employee that I ever came across My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiencesSyd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup I demanded a new cup and she was like "why do you want another cup" and I said cause you coughed into it She rolled her eyes and got another cupAt this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line Finally supervisor ordered her drink As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was Syd the kid said "who knows Probably a stripper" wrong Syd  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face Great impression of old town she must have hadWe both had the piña-kale-Ada which was okay Didn't taste organic.
My sister dragged me here with the kids but to mu surprise everything was awesomeThe valducci pasta with chicken was amazing it had olives artichoke hearts with penne pasta and a creamy tomato sauceMmmmm my mouth is waterin wishing I kept some fr lunch todayThe service was very good we had 4 kis with us so that's no easy task server was all over the bread and drink refills Thank you I will be cming back.
I'm not an expert on New Orleans seafood by any means but the mixed seafood grill was very good  Everything was cooked perfectly which is quite a trick especially with the variety of meats on the skewer  I would have saved some for leftovers but my hotel room doesn't have refrigerator or microwave :(The only thing I could have wished for is wild Pacific salmon instead of the Atlantic salmon but I guess that would make it less authenticI dined on the patio so I didn't much of a feel for the ambience inside but it did seem rather loud as I passed through the lobby.
Terrible CS will never go back Beware of terrible service Bad attitude Would not honor REI's return policy  I will take my business to a store that treats me right They make you think you are part of the CO-OP by buying in what a joke  I have been a member for over a decade and they have lost a loyal customer.
While I acknowledge I got there at 5:05 am - 5 minutes after they were set to close the complete lack of compassion of the people I encountered was quite surprising  Here I am 5 months pregnant with a sick toddler still in his PJs in an obvious rush to make it in the doors by 5 am  The lobby is completely empty and the front door unlocked when I arrive  I hear someone in the back say "that's not someone new is it"  and another voice responded "no probably just someone leaving"  Next thing I know I see the people who own the voices I heard - one looks like one of the doctors or nurses and the other like the person who runs the front desk area  All I get is "sorry we're closed"  With the fact that I didn't make it in time sinking in near tears (I blame the pregnancy hormones) I explain that I had a difficult time finding them in the strip mall where they are located and got stuck at a light  This time I get one word - "sorry"  I look up to see faces of stone  Nothing  Neither of the ladies offered any suggestion on where else I might be able to take my sick child to be seen by a doctor which we were obviously in need of since we'd come to their urgent care for that very reason   I say "you guys don't open again until 9 pm right"  I get a short reply "5 pm"  I then ask if they know when Phoenix Children's urgent care opens  Absolute silence  I know this is technically a competitor but if you care about kids wouldn't you want to ensure a sick child gets the care he needs irrespective of whether it comes from your company or another  I was so frustrated when I left that I did  start to cry a bit as I buckled my son back into his car seat and made my way home to wait the 7 hours until the next pediatric urgent care opened  On the drive home I tried to see the positive side of my encounter- maybe it was a good thing that we were too late to be seen since I wouldn't want such uncaring people to treat my son anyway.
Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich  Yikes  We will not return.
Second large group experience hereOut with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R we walked to Saddle Ranch  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10 but volunteered that since we had a wait they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house ()The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes but the bartender made great drinks food and prices were good and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots again on the house  I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyaltyEDIT: If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink the AMF is the house specialty  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long islandIf you ride the bull as a guy the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible  For girls however they go pretty easy on you.
do not order delivery hour and a half had to cancel.
Thuan Kieu is a Vietnamese restaurant that specialize in rice dishes  Although they don't have Pho they do have noodles and vermicelliI think their most famous dish is Broken Rice with (crispy) Bean Curd Skin w/ Shrimp  Needless to say it is very good I ordered a plate with the bean curd shredded pork steam egg and charbroiled meatball and my wife ordered broken rice with grilled pork chop  Both come with nuoc cham dipping sauce  I've never been impressed with other restaurant's shredded pork (too dry) and steam egg (dry & hard) but Thuan Kieu managed to exceed my expectationThe shredded pork is soft same with the steamed egg (without being soggy)  The charbroiled meatball and pork chop are also very goodWe also ordered Nem Nuong Nha Trang  They are spring rolls with charbroiled meatballs crispy eggroll skins and a bunch of veggies  I have to say they are the best in the valley I can just eat these for lunch (they come in a set of four)  If you want better Nem Nuong you will have to go to Brodard in LA Little Saigon I highly recommend this Vietnamese restaurant  Their rice dishes are top notch  Don't forget to bring some cash since they are a cash only restaurant.
Horrible Rude the minute he saw my coupon  Massage didn't even last 2 minutes Not friendly what so ever - go elsewhere.
Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado almost three years ago But for what it's worth this is the best most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far =).
This place is so stinking cute you should definitely pop by I was lured in by the smell when I was in the area on a Saturday morning and was greeted by the owner and her lovely daughter This family is so sweet and they let me sample a few flavors I've been to other gourmet popcorn shops in NYC but this was the first I've seen in AZ They had tons of crazy flavors like Strawberry and Blueberry Mojito I ended up buying two medium-size bags of Caramel and Garlic Parmesan under $10 total Definitely recommend.
To start offI am not a big fan of burgers It is about the last thing I will pick as a food option given a choice Well we came here for a burger one night and wow I was impressed The burger was delicious We both got the BBQ Bacon and Cheddar burger The best parts of this burger were the haystack onions and the bacon I got the BBQ sauce on the side The burger was SO juicy The fries were delicious The staff went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful Now if given the choiceI just may pick a burger as an option to eat so long as it is at a Smashburger.
Best country bar in Scottsdale Also its a cool place to relax your mind from a busy day at work Also the band that plays on thursday nite to saturday nite is awesomechheeeeehaaaa.
Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business Like almost everyone else who showed up early I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate What I found instead was that the management lied (they even admitted it to our faces) and guys were now $20 to get in (girls would be $10 after 10)Half our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long Am I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer Maybe I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway WHY Why was I even there and why did I give them my business Never againOh and the inside was packed like sardines They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right getting a drink was hopeless and bathroom lines were a half hour long People were hopping the fence to get in sick and tired of the line outside But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anywayWe stayed till midnight thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website and pass out flutes of champagne NopeThis would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix I know it's just a bar but honestly people we need to hold places accountable for deception My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined and half our party left fed up with the situationDon't go to American Junkie it is just that junk.
I love this place just noticed my review was removed Does anyone know where I can check that.
The land of "yes"  Make any request and it will be done  Killer infinity pool  Amazing view  Lovely rooms  One of my all time favorite hotels  Expensive  Go during off seasonUpdate:  Hmmm seems to be turning into quite the celebrity hideaway  The bartender used to tell me about Britney's stays  And I did see chef Mario Batali leaving one night  But most recently Vince and Jennifer were guests.
Yes we live in Laveen and 1 We are DESPERATE for some decent cuisine over here 2 HELP 3 WHY 4 HELP Anyway I am not giving this place 5 stars because of any of the above  if I was back in Orange County oh sorry the Oooo See I would do the same thing And we even have Thrifty Ice Cream there I mean let's be real The only real ace in the hold for Thrifty is that darn coveted chocolate malted crunch that seems impossible for anyone to recreate Scooptacular however has many many flavors that are great and maybe one day they'll find a way to rival the chocolate malted crunch icon The interior is adorable with a cotton candy style color palette There's even a Disney movie usually playing and some pretty decent seating I was leveling off some of my ice cream getting a bit greedy about getting down to my favorite part the rim of the sugar cone meets the melted treat yum The manager came by & said oh is everything ok & I said oh yes I just have TOO much ice cream & I want my cone if that's the worst complaint well there you go  I really hope everyone goes out & supports what is probably one of the best non-chain (ok let's be honest that's pretty much all we freaking have APPLEBEE'S ICK) places around.

Costco Tire Department leaves much to be desiredMy wife's car needed new tires  We like shopping in Avondale and headed over to Costco  The guy who sold the tires was nice enough and seemed knowledgeable about tires Installation was completed quicklyThat's the good news The problem we had was that we received an ad later than day about the same tires being available for about $25 cheaper  Went back to the store expecting the great service you hear about from Costco  I didn't find it  And I really triedThe store staff relayed that Costco does not price match  They then offered take our new tires as a return with a refund minus the installation and disposal fee  Asking why they would keep the disposal fee they said they wouldn't be able to find our original tires to put back on  I questioned how I would be able to drive away if they didn't give our tires back one technician said he didn't knowNot believing these to be intelligent answers I spoke with a manager  After talking it through she shared that didn't make sense but was all they could offer  I'm still not sure if that was supposed to make me feel better or worse  I emailed Costco customer services online and got no response after a weekBottom line: Not the best prices Don't stand behind their prices Offers a frustrating customer service experience Has service staff who are nice but unable/unwilling to do much.
This is actually a review of their Phoenix location which recently opened in COFCO plaza  I've never been to any other location Their food/cakes/breads are simply amazing I honestly consider this new location a slice of baked heaven They are open until 7:30 the food is always fresh everything tastes wonderful and the recipes are always consistent I tried a sandwich a chicken wrap and a strawberry smoothie today All of them were beyond delicious  I'm a huge fan of their Hong Kong Milk Tea as wellTheir customer service is phenomenal The girl who is always working there is very sweet and remembers her customers I hope that it brings more business to the slowly dying COFCO plaza I'm sure the bakery inside Super L is pissed - and they should be They have some heavy competition ).
I come here almost every morning for my breakfast smoothie Staff is always friendly and the smoothies and always good They are much cheaper then other smoothie places and you get more I personally think they taste better as well They also allow you to change up the ingredients in the smoothies to you liking.
Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good (Not the best but good) This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item Machaca breakfast burrito with potato  I've had this many times in the past but OMG  I could not even finish it  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it  How do you call it breakfast without an egg   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it  (Yes burger Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are  Er Used to be  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste  (How do you mess up a taco) I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon Beware this place may be on the way out.
Everyone on Yelp is right this place is great It's fast fresh and affordable I created a roll filled with everything I like and so I loved it I got: white rice seaweed spicy salmon green onion cucumber masago chili oil and sweet chili's Since I decide what went in it I controlled the calories My sister got one of their bowls We were both really happy with our orders.
Carrie is very professional friendly and personable  I always feel like I'm catching up with a friend  She does an awesome job and gives honest feedback.
This is about the saddest little kiosk I've ever seen Stranded in PHX three hours on the way to Cabo and four hours back I had enough time to browse four gates of culinary options Although there was one CPK ASAP that actually served pizza there were a few that were downright pathetic so small they only housed a fridge stocked with drinks and salad Isn't serving pizza the whole point Apparently not alwaysMy girlfriend and I did have pizza at the CPKASAP that served pizza There was a bit of a wait the seating area was pretty dinky and the pizza aside from the BBQ chicken toppings tasted to me just a half step up from Pizza Hut which also infests this airport Sure beggars can't be choosers and with limited options CPK may be as good a bet as any But it may do yourself some good to keep your expectations very very low.
Rude old man manager was a total scrooge this holiday season  Salespeople are too busy pimping nooks to treat customers w respect  Luckily the cafe workers were lovelyI miss the way this establishment used to b when it opened.
Yes  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness but it's twice as awesome  You get what you pay for at Lifetime  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym  It's the little things you don't need to bring a towel soap a locker key or lunch  The café has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast lunch kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu   As a vegetarian there are several options for me to choose from   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years I honestly could never switch gyms call me a snob  I don't care.
How the hell can this place be sitting on top of a Pei Wei and a StarbucksIt's a hip urban lounge Spacious lots of comfy seating including a wall hugging couch seat thingymabob Kind of a modern take on a 70's era lounge without the ferns but with the mood lighting They mix a damn good drink - especially their Margaritas which are made with a home made mix not the neon green shit from a bottle The music is aways downtempo The mood is chill I've only gone with friends so far but could see it making a good stop on a date It's def the kind of place where you want to BYOC (bring your own company) because there isn't much of a social atmosphere But for a fun classy place to go with friends it's awesome Once you're feeling sauced up head down the way to Bikini Lounge and cause some ruckus.
I was looking for a unique setting to have a Holiday party for my staff of 17  Heinrich was gracious and accommodated my request to have the function on the patio with heaters and surrounding the large fire pit  It was great  The wait staff especially Kristen did a great job making sure everyone had what they wished  I'm looking forward to bringing my wife and this time I can enjoy the wine menu too.
I stopped in their last night right before I hit up the Jamie Foxx concert at the Dodge Theater It's a cute little place Very clean and quite quiet on a Thursday evening But then again it was technically after hours (7pm) in the downtown area so unless major is going on it just may be like this all the time The guy that took care of me was really sweet I wish I would have gotten his name He was patient as I was trying to decide on the only slice of pizza I wanted LOL In the end I choose a huge slice of piping hot pepperoni and for under $300 for my slice not to shabby I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza I swear their was pepperoni in ever bite It wasn't greasy and the crust was just perfect He even checked up on me to make sure I didn't want a second slice My mind was screaming YES YES but alas I was good and politely declinedVery friendly very clean great prices and damn good pizza They have tons of specials so you can't go wrong Check this place out if you haven't already.
Oh my How have I NOT reviewed this place yet It is amazing This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there he is the best Always happy to see you and ready to chat while he cooks I have gone in here with my mom and sister with just me and Hubs and with my 2 little ones Every time the food is fantastic If it's just the girls working the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there but the food makes up for that Try the tortilla soup Made right there in front of you and ohhhh sooo good Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica mmm I think that is the best way to go And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for And if you throw in a dollar for them they ring the bell and yell "AYYYY" lol Also good prices especially if you split something which is totally doable since their servings are huge.
I cannot begin to express how elated I was after eating at this establishment Decided Sunday morning to try a new breakfast place and after a failed attempt at TC Eggingtons found this place via a Yelp recommendation for their Eggs Benedict Drove across town to The Gilbert House which is situated right outside of 'old town' Gilbert The minute we walked up to the front door we were greeted and seated immediately by their staff Our waitress took our drink orders practically as we had just finished sitting down and with our minds made up as to what we were going to order placed our orders promptly in the kitchen The food came out in a flash and the presentation of our dishes was phenomenal I cannot even begin to tell you how impressed I was with the cleanliness of this restaurant in particular their silverware I've been out to eat many times and never once have I had such impeccable service and food The owners of this establishment should be extremely proud of the wonderful staff they've hired.
Whenever the need arises to wash my vehicleAnd I'm in the mood for delicious slow roasted brisket ribs or pulled porkAnd I need to pick through the convenience store-like grocery case for some Nestle's Strawberry milkAnd I want to watch international soccer games in the car wash waiting area after the pulled porkwith a flavorful Starbuck's-like coffee creation from the coffee bar while my vehicleremember my vehiclethe one that needed cleaningis getting cleaned I come hereTom's Thumb Fresh MarketWhere I can satiate all my worldly needs in one fell swoopsave for getting laidBut I'm guessing if one got really creative he/she could throw-down somewhere on this huge property If you are going to have a go at it I wouldn't use the men's room thoughIt smells kind-of weirdcould sour the mood From this reviewer's perspective the only thing missing is a place to take a nap after getting laidA short nap after a furious jaunt is always refreshing and I think the proprietors could have thought through this a little more carefully when building their business plan because had they done so this place would be perfect in my book A place to get my truck washed eat barbecue drink a beer watch soccer drink latte's along with a fuck and a short nap followed by the attendant tossing me my keys Now that's the shitI'd like to summarize by suggesting how this place may very well be a mere fuck and a short nap away from heaven.
Da bomb.
I absolutely love Dr Finley She sits down with you and answers ALL of your questions always Not like your typical doctor who comes in does whatever you have scheduled and then leaves Dr Finley will sit down and answer all of your questions about your symptoms on that day or other symptoms you had last week She takes the time to explain things to you and genuinely cares about her patientsI have been seeing Dr Finley for years I have followed her to this new practice and will follow her if she moves again I recommend Dr Finley to anyone who asks She is great honest and genuinely cares I am aware that the Doctor can't control the paperwork that is required and needed on file and updated annually That kind of administrative stuff is left to the owner of the practice I also understand that Dr Finley didn't set up the prescription policy either again that is up to whomever owns the practice and their legal team I completely understand that it takes staff and Dr Finley's time and a lot of it to constantly be calling in new prescription For the amount of patients the practice has it has got to take up most of there day going back and forth with RPH and verifying the script gets there etc I don't mind coming in 4 times a year for the Dr to verify my symptoms and that I still need my maintenance medications  I wanted to touch base on Amber H negative comments:Yes her front desk person could smile more But she is in no way rude If you read my other reviews you know I don't stand for rude LOL Yes the pretesting is not in a closed patient room I've never been to an office that weighs you AND takes your BP in a closed patient  room Pre-testing is always done out in the open but behind the wall separating the lobby from the PT rooms in any doctors office I've been to  Maybe the BP is taken in a room usually although I have never been weighed and had my temp taken in the patient room Again this is not reflective of Dr Finley but of the owner of the practice and their desires As for the waiting when you are a new patient you come in early and you will see people showing up after you and going in before you because they dont have to come in early for paperwork I can tell you that when I come in for my scheduled visits as an established patient I never wait more than 5 min past my appointment time I would and DO recommend Dr Finley to all of my co-workers (as she is in network) and all of my friends who are in need of a new doctor.
HOTEL:The resort grounds are gorgeous  Unfortunately I did not have a great opportunity to roam the area since I was there for a work conference  The views are beautifulThe lobby is spacious and inviting with complementary iced tea and cooled water as soon as you walk through the doors  This is replicated throughout the common areas of the hotel (at least away from the lounge and restaurants) since it is so hot and dry  I found this to be a nice part of my stay given the need for frequent rehydration shows some level of caring about my stay by the hotelThe lounge area off the lobby is roomy and comfortable with outside seating also available  The bar area is a lightly staffed if there is a large conference but seems adequate for the usual level of lounge guestsRooms are spacious and comfortable  Beds are medium in hardness with a plethora of pillows I did note that there were several different grades of stiffness to my pillows not sure if this was planned or just luck  I do notice these things since I am not a soft mattress or pillow kind of person  The bathroom has a separate shower and tub for soakingThe concierge staff was extremely helpful in picking out restaurants and with transportation  All staff members were polite and helpfulThe only drawback to my stay was that the Marriott does not have free wifi internet instead it is a pay ethernet service in your room or a paid wifi in the conference area  This seems to be a Marriott thing rather then a site particular quirkCONFERENCE AREA:This was a small to medium sized conference I attended and went throughs several meetings in all the different areas  I found the conference rooms to be well maintained with a good AV system that was brought in and set up  The computers ran well for presentations and the projectors that were obtained were excellent  The bulbs were in good working condition so the presentations were not washed out or faded in appearance especially when showing darker images with subtle pointsThe acoustics were adequate depended on which particular room you were in at the time but none were bad  The audio system with the wireless microphone system worked well with minimal to no feedback (instances were more presenter problems then equipment problems)I felt that the conference area was excellent and I was happy with the presentations I attended and gave from a logistics standpoint  There was always staff present to assist should there be a problemThe drawback was again no free wifi for the conference although you can pay for conference wifi and give attendees a code for free (to them) access my conference did notThe disclaimer is that I am not sure how much of the conference set up was handled by the Marriott and how much by the organization holding the conference.
This place is simply amazingWe eat there at least once a weekFor many yearsDefinitely a place to go for people who appreciate good food and service.
Phoenix is a one of a kind city that is beautiful fashionable BIG and luxurious :-).
Great Mexican food with a friendly staff  Looks small from the outside but has plenty of room for dine in inside  Agree that the homemade tortillas are awesome  Brought some home for my family (as I am GF I couldn't try them but they reported they were awesome)  They have a great selection of food my favorite was machaca and eggsJust moved to AZ and live in East valley but am back here everytime I am in area (3xs so far in 2 months)  Highly recommend.
I'm from Michigan and remember Mr Scribs being my favorite pizza there So when I heard it was now in Goodyear I was elated  There simply is no better pizza around in my opinion It's absolutely perfect  Maybe a bit pricey -- but I'll bite the bullet or hope for another coupon in the mail With the coupon I used I got 3 topping 16" for about $10ish dollars Very reasonable with coupon Hoping they bring the cauliflour side to AZ  yum Anyway dont hesitate to try And wear your loose pants because you will eat way more than normal.
Ahhh gelatowhat would the world be like without it I don't want to know It's amazing stuff and this establishment has a great selection of flavors They offer sample tastings and although I could easily try all of them I figured two was socially acceptable  The decor has a euro-retro feel and there always seems to be somewhere to sit which is nice We've never ordered the Italian coffee although it smells delicious as well A great treat anytime.
Fun place tasty custard and excellent customer service  Both times I have been Keith has been behind the counter  He is very informative and was kind enough to let me try a few flavors before deciding on my vanilla custard with hot fudge  Will definitely be back:).
Wish they had one of these in Dallas We love the food so much and dined there at least 3 times while visiting The shiritaki noodles are amazeballs Acorn Squash pizza was nice as well I highly recommend coming to this place and trying everything out even the cocktails and elixirs.
Same great food new location  I like the leaner brisket but have tried everything at different locations and EVERYTHING is good  Forget the sissy sause and just go with the good stuff BUT this stuff is so good try it without first  There are no plates so just get over it the food wont be there long anyway.

The whole experience was perfect Was here last Sunday morning for brunch and was so thrilled with the choice in location for our get together The staff was great Our server was very friendly and patient with our party of 15 The server decided to split up the order which was a fantastic idea The food for the other side came out right after she had even finished taking our order Love when food is quick but not at the burden of the quality of food This was not at all the case The restaurant was pretty empty but we did not have to wait long for our food Typically it's a waiting game when you have a large group I ordered the breakfast panini which was delicious I've actually been craving it ever since I was there The panini had egg mozzarella tomato and spinach on it The bread was fresh and the potato wedges were to die for I was told to try their pesto sauce and fell in love Dipping my sandwich was exactly what I needed The mimosas were tasty Wished that the Bellini would have been on special also but that wasn't a problem Mimosas did the job They had a live band playing at brunch He was very talented and the level of sound was not too loud for us girls to chat I will be coming back to this restaurant because there are so many delicious looking options or maybe I'm just ready for another mimosa.
I adore Maizie's Good burgers and drinks Sit at the bar and you will be well taken care of The last time I was there I had a watermelon vodka spritzer ONE ONEand I was done The bartender is always so nicehappy and recommends what she has had and likes THAT is a plus to me Laid back and trendy Good date spotor friends hanging spot.
We decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15% off for first deliveryperfect  so i ordered on line with a  delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him knowperferct so came the delivery timeplus 10 minutesplus 10 more minutesplus 10 more minutesso i called back to find out where the order wasshe said   oh were sorry we thought it was for pick upWHAT THE HELL so i can't tell you how the food is BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT ANY ended up going else where A return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice.
I have followed Hayley for 8 years now I drive 45 minutes out of my way just to have her do my hair once every 6 weeks She is extremely detailed and is a perfectionist when it comes to color cut and style Habit Salon was located on Southern in Mesa but recently moved to Baseline in Gilbert The new salon is a lot larger brighter and sleek looking inside  They will also be opening a new braid bar blow dry bar and a new concept called "a try me bar" The try me bar is where you can come in to test out new products in your hair I'm not sure if the salon has their new phone number listed yet however you can reach Hayley for an appointment at 4802162718.
My review is not kind the doctors are fine however the cost issue for me has been a nightmare I only have a 1000 dollar a month social security check with no other income and no insurance at this time I am a cancer patience in remission always in need of follow up xrays however I am doing reasonabley well However it was discovered that I have a heart issue and require a ct scan I bearly could scrape up the 10000 dollar co-pay for the surgeon For this ct scan it requires 29000 dollars that I could not come up with I offered the DMG services half and ask if I could pay the other half when I received my next check For the second time a clerk simply told me that if I could not come up with the money I could not have the test I requested to talk with a supervisor and was denied and was told the policy will simply hold I brought to the attention of this clerk my health issues and the concern of the heart surgeon she said it simply does not matter  To make things worse DMG services has missed billed me more than once I paid them last time 15000 dollars for a service and have the receipt and they could not account as to where it went The same clerk finally had to conceid and correct the bill for the second time I have on file eight times where I made a co-payment to doctors and was sent a bill wanting me to pay for it again Just two days ago I went through the same thing over to bills I sent copies of my receipts for them to correct the issuesI am 63 years old no other income not married and I have a clerk making a decision about my life with no accountability I can only assume that Maricopa county has a kill zone I noticed they have a refugee area those individuals seem to be doing quite well of coarse younger I would like to apply for refugee status.
Been back a few times since and have had nothing but great experiences Our last visit was awesome because it was later on Saturday night and wasn't very busy at all Our waiter was really chill Lol I don't really know what adjective to use for him He was really quiet and reserved but he was also one of the best waiters ever Tons of refills he was there when we needed him and there was no forced small talk or unnecessary words It's like he could see into our souls Almost like he knew us better than we knew ourselves :OI have no idea what his name was but yeah he was pretty awesome The passion fruit iced tea was pretty good and he even offered iced teas to go before we even thought of asking for any Yeah I pretty much peed a lot that night way too much tea (If there is such a thing)That last experience really prompted me to bring this up to a 5 star rating I love Pita Jungle but other locations usually annoy me a bit This one is just too awesome :).
The best Breakfast I have had in at least 10 years When we walked in the whole place had this wonderful mesquite campfire smell The carne asada I ordered was amazing It had the perfect amount of charred smoky red chille flavoring and made this one memorable meal.
I've just found out about this place a week ago and so far it's pretty awesome Vietnamese food I've actually been eating here for the past 4 days Everyday for dinner Their seasoning is very palatable to the taste And priced very reasonable actually very cheap I've had the pho chao long Banh xeo com ga nuong Bo nuong la nho mi Sui Cao bun bo hue and they are all very delicious I don't know about the reviewer saying that the Banh xeo( Vietnamese crepes) was yuck he probably never had it before and don't know what it's SUPPOSED to taste like and making a review of something he doesn't know anything about But their Banh xeo is actually very good It's crispy which is hard to accomplish and has all the fillings balanced You're supposed to dip it into the nuoc Cham to get all the flavors out of the dish I'm Vietnamese and a very picky eater and this restaurant serves really good home cooked Vietnamese dishes.
My favorite sandwich shop period.
Four words: Tomato Garlic mushroom pizza Two more: Meat Lasagna  Been dining and ordering delivery from here since they opened Great delivery time and the food is always consistent I'm not a big fan of square cut pies so I always request it be sliced The toasted club tuna salad sandwich garlic cheese bread (OMG) and crinkle cut fries are also favorites Don't forget the made in-house ranch dressing that is the best ranch you can order out Pick up a bottle of red wine order the large meat lasagna to share with your sweetie and an order of garlic cheese bread - you will NOT be sorry Delish.
I came here for the first time with a friend We were really pleased by the great service from our server and the rest of the staff The owner was very welcoming and friendly which made for a great experience The food was just as good as the great service I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
This is a wonderful barre studio  I got hooked on barre at the Village but (at least when I was a member) there were only two classes a week  Karve has several classes a day - enough that there is no excuse for skipping  It also helps that Karve is right next door to Daydreams so someone can watch the little ones for me too Flexible schedule and babysitting - there go my excuses  Every single instructor is wonderful challenging upbeat and professional  The staff here is just incredible They really really know what they are doing AND there is usually at least one other instructor in the class actually taking the class  Got to admit - I like it that the instructors take the classes too and that they also shake and struggle through thigh work  I appreciate that there is a "formula" to the class but that even after about 50 classes I have not been bored  And finally I really like the other women that go to Karve  It is a beautiful place to spend an hour.
Freaking out a little Just got finished eating there Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor At least if I get sick tonight I will know why.
Best pizza I found so far in tempe A little pricey but you get your money worth I like the mamma's spinach CALZONE The mamma's spinach pizza wasnt as good Be prepared for some garlic though You may want to ask w/o garlic if you dont like it -)  overall really really good.
Great little frozen yogurt place The place was super clean and the staff very friendlyI got the raspberry-pomegranate which I highly recommend if you don't like flavors that are overly sweet There are tons of toppings that you can add including tons of freshly cut fruits and also the typical candy/nut topicsThe berries and kiwis go great with the raspberry-pomegranate.
Very reasonable priced service was nice and friendly family oriented  WiFi is free go on in and set up you can enjoy a meal and get work done at the same time.
Premium price but worth the extra cost if you have the cash to burn Fantastic place for date nights will definitely impress.
NOCA stands for North Of CamelbAck i love this place went with a few friends  The foods are such a delight Chris the Chef actually trained years in San Francisoco before coming to the valley their duck is crips and sweet and to top it off their Scallopsomg it is sweet and delicious it melts in your mouth (not a taste of dry or fishyness)  Definitely a must  They also have a private dinning area for small parties  I would suggest calling for the menu before going because their menu changes daily it enables them to serve up the freshest dishes.
This is a very nice store I have to say a bit more helpful than the one in ScottsdaleThis location knows what Nordstrom is known for Great Customer ServiceThis is a few days after Christmas now and there is still major mall activityMore I think than before ChristmasBut Nordstrom is still nice still easy to be there and to deal withI had to return a pair of shoes I had gotten for Christmas WhyBecause I just did not like them Nordstrom is great with returns as well They took them back  credited the account and I was on my wayPlus they are the nicest decorated store in the mall.
Wonderful country store Christmas time was nice with unique ornaments and decorations I purchased a table here not too long ago good quality and i constantly receive compliments on the piece.
unPhogettable is PHOnominal Ok bad joke aside this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting Although a bit far from my house I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again.
Had a wonderful time great food got to see friends there this morning and very decent prices :).
another visit another great haircut at a great price.
I'm in Phoenix and staying with a friend for a conference (TPE/NASPA) Never having been to Phoenix before I asked my friend for a few suggestions around the convention center area to have lunch/dinners with old friends and colleagues He suggested this place and informed me it is ranked #1 in the nation Being an aspiring foodie and someone who is very judgmental of pizza these are big shoes to fill Myself and a good friend went on a Friday around 12:15 I was a little nervous about getting in and out in the needed time knowing that it was a small place and could have hours of wait time for dinner Not a problem We were seated immediately and there were tables to spare We both ordered coke lights (apparently the Italian version of diet coke) and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty We asked our server if we could only order one pizza which one he would suggest He told us the Biancoverde with added prosciutto was the one to get so we went for it NO REGRETS This pizza was tasty Thin crust and oh so flavorful the ricotta and cheese were amazing and the prosciutto was yummy not overly salty like some can be It can seem a little pricey our one pizza was $24 but it fed both of us comfortably I definitely recommend and passed along the info to a couple friends at the conference as well I may even end up venturing back before my time comes to an end in Phoenixonly time will tell.
So good.
Great "quick service" Mexican food  Nothing too fancy the food here is great  Line can be long at times so I always call the order in about 10 minutes before I get there  Not everything is amazing but their best items can't be beat  In my opinion here are their items in order of awesomeness:1) Marinated Pork Burrito1a) Shrimp Taco (Fish is great too)2) Bombero Burrito  (very spicy so watch out)After those it's all about personal taste  Great place high recommended.
I am appalled at the other reviews of Dr Kozinn  My experience with him was nothing but positive  It seems like people just come here to complain  I was treated with dignity and respect at all times.
A bookstore in a mall genius  WRONG not when you work there and your General Manager is a selfish idiot   I have not been back since I left this horrible job but I do hope that things have straightened themselves out and that they fired that bitch Marcie    I  mean what kind of company keeps a General Manger who walks out of her store seeing a line that has grown 20 people deep with the phones ringing off hook and not to mention the lack of staff on the sales floor to assist those growing impatient customers  I can't even tell you how many times I had to take customer complaints about the lack of staff   As far as product they might say they have it but good luck at finding it  These high school seniors and freshman college students they hire have far better things on their minds (themselves) and could care less where they have shelved  that book you are now looking for   Now if it's a best seller you'll have no problem finding it since it will be displayed on tables and end-cap displays through out the store and depending on the season possibly displayed in a floor stack as wellafter all they did receive 50 copies of the book to begin with and receive an additional 12 when 1 is sold As for  CD's and DVD's since you are already at the mall I would recommend going somewhere else as they are far over priced at any BordersThe only thing I would rave about is the magazine selection  The Biltmore location will provide you with the widest variety but all locations have a ridiculous amount of titles.
- I was there March 16th      This coffee shop is AMAZING i love the vibe the artwork their freshness and of course their cookies     I have already been raving to my friends how good this place is and how we need to frequent coffee shops like this kind more often instead of our usual Starbucks     The service is outstanding as I walked to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and I bluntly told him that it was my first time there and that I was taking their Chai as well as a pastry but I didn't know which one He then started telling me that their pastries are freshly baked each morning at their downtown location and that he suggested the Chocolate Chip cookie as it was his own Fav So I told him You had me at freshly baked I'll take your chocolate chip coffee and a Medium non-fat Chai The only thing was that they didn't have medium sized drinks they only have small or large small is just too little for me and large is just too much medium is just perfect for me but no medium and I end up not drinking it all So I took the large and as expected I wasted about 1/6 of my deliciously large hot  foamy non-fat Chai :)    I will surely be back to frequent this spot everyone there was oh soo friendly :).
We were *that* family that brought a cranky toddler and a picky 9 year old to a fine steak house and Fleming's survived with style and grace and an excellent sense of humor  We enjoyed every item on their happy hour menu as well as a pile of cocktails and every single thing was absolutely delicious  I think the happy hour here must be one of the best values ever in the history of happy hours  Our server was funny - seemingly a little distant but in actuality totally attentive and on top of every special request we had  Our favorite was our bus boy who had the nicest manners I've ever seen on an 18 year old  His family should be so proud of such a great young manWish we lived in town we'd be regulars  Thanks Fleming's for allowing us to enjoy a white table cloth evening while still enjoying time with our kids.
Like the 80s group ABC sang "It's so hip so hip it hurts" But hurt in a good way (you know like nice naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice Are we clear I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming color splashed glass brick adorned room this was a major score in the Staycation category I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool Just posing around the pool Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin My extremely freakishly small nipples Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home HmmmfBack to the roomthe glass brick divided the room from the showerand what a fabulous shower Nice big pulsating head Honestly I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr Gonzales the stylist the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me Who needs TV It was very entertaining And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio Wait Wasn't that a B52s song So Valley Hoyou are hip But you're also great deal A great venue And yes maybe even OK I"m getting a little vaklempt a great friend.
Five stars no doubt for Brian the store manager I know you can't seek him out for everything because I'm sure he's busy Last night my husband had to have a water heater replacedGE agreed to replace it but had us take it to home depot and then have home depot call GE I thought it would be a nightmare and they would look at him like he was a nutBrian got right on it Had someone from the Customer Service desk call while he searched for the water heater (which was hiding btw he found it though) My husband doesn't go in to details about his experience at storeshe's just not that interested but he raved about BrianBrian helped us once before in the lawn and garden dept He was honest about the product and offered something more effective He must have taken some crazy advanced Customer Service class or he isnotfromthisplanet Seriously he rocksThere's a woman that works in plumbing tooI don't know her name I think she said her family owned a plumbing business at one time She knows her shit If it not for these two I wouldn't even rate that store because my mother always said "if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all".
I was in Scottsdale for a couple weeks about 2 months ago and decided to come here for dinner with a few coworkers one night what a mistake The service was horrible and slow we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow The place was not that busy so the fact that we had to wait that long for our food is unacceptable not to mention we had to wait up front for the hostess to stop talking to her coworkers at the bar to come seat us The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter It looks like a fun place from the outside but beware once you come in.
Trendy hip good looking staff nice outdoor seating option clean  Great place to grab a bite with colleagues  Great people watching and the food is really enjoyable  Definitely get the pretzels and fondue and the dessert with Carmel popcorn is another must have  Fox restaurants are consistently very good  Pricing is ok and not obnoxiously expensive especially for being located at Scottsdale fashion square mall.
Ate here tonight was sitting at the table next to another person who wrote a bad review  The coals in their oven died out from over use that's what happens when you are constantly moving pizzas in and out especially on a busy night  The guys making the pizza's did a great job cranking out pies as fast as they could but you can only fit so many in the oven at 1 time  The oven was not broken as another reviewer stated earlier  She also stated that it took an hour for her two pizza's funny we ordered the same time as you our pizza took 35 minutes and you received yours before we did  I'm tired of people acting like it's the end of the world when your order takes a little longer than normal  It's Friday night the place is packed you are there with friends and family enjoy your time out together or were you in a hurry to leave because your bratty son kept spilling his water and bumping into my wife's chair  The server had informed us about the situation prior to our order just like she did to the other tables around us  Pizza came out great as always and our server was very friendly and accommodating even when a 15 top of rowdy men were seated in her section  For a corporate restaurant chain the pizza is great  1/2  carafe of wine and a large pizza our check was just over $30  The location in DC ranch is beautiful but you end up with snotty btches like the other reviewer tonight  From what I recall she was in an 8 top with two children who couldn't stay in their seats most of the time the entire party were on cell phones and nobody seemed to be conversing I only saw 2 pizzas on your table along with 3 beers a salad and the rest glasses of water  So as an 8 top your check was probably around $60 which was  undoubtedly discounted after you made a scene complaining about how long it took  I will definitely be back the pizza is very good (much better than the Scottsdale quarter location) the staff is friendly just sometimes the guests need to lighten up if you wanted pizza in 30 minutes or less call dominoes.
My ABSOLUTE favoriteCame all the way from LA CA just to have some delicious breakfast.
I don't know what sort of seasoning they use for the chicken and steak shawarma but I thought it was disgusting  The gyro was decent and the baklava was ok.
THIS STORE CLOSED RECENTLY I'm really going to miss this little gem.
Sam is the best  I love how he knows and remembers is customers  A friendly face happy smile and just about everything you need for the perfect cocktail or all out beer bash  I am happy to support this locally owned business.
Went to eat there after hearing about how good their strip steak was We were staying at the pointe and had our two kids and two of their friends with us  After being seated by a nice host we were greeted by our server She seemed some what rushed although there was no wait tonight After letting the kids and my wife order I requested the strip steak I was informed there was none left  I was given no alternative or substitute which left me with a choice of doubling my meal price to a 24oz rib steak or something else Well the only reason I chose this place was because of the steak So after I gave the server some time to offer an alternative she just left with everyones order but mine  After no service for around 10 min I finally asked for the manager He was nice but offered no solution other than I order the $46-$48 steak or I could wait while he gets a steak from another restaurant  Which was nice but meant I eat after my family was already done eating I suggested giving my the rib steak as a half portion and he answered me with "then what do I do with the other half of the steak" I could not believe he actually said that So with my wife and  4 kids finished eating I was just getting my meal When the bill came is expected some sort of courtesy (maybe comp some of the beverages)  nope In fact we were charged full price for everything and had a 18% gratuity added to the bill already I was hoping maybe it was just a server having an off day but when the manager see's fit to make a comment like "what do you expect me to do with the other half of the steak" I am convinced it is more about poor leadershipOverall the experience was very bad the service was poor and we will never again eat there In fact I will be telling everyone that I know not to eat there We will eat off property during our next stay at the pointe squaw peak.

OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH-PRICED  food quality not bad but not that good either You can just get your sushi at Costco or Fry's and not feel you were    had Food portions are too small The serving size of the appetizers are way too small not filling enough even for a toddler We had to eat at McDonald's after.
All I know is that they make the best al pastor burritos and tacos in Phoenix They are just sweet enough just savory enough and I always want 50 more of them When it's sunny and not smoldering hot outside the picnic tables out front are a great place to have lunch Parking can get to be tricky when it's busy but you can go next door and thrift shop it up while you wait for your food to be ready.
Exactly one year later and I've been to V's all but twice in the past 12 months and only because of scheduling conflictsIf coming from the Supercuts Greatclips etc ad nauseum experience V's will seem different Gone is the spikey uneven hair on top of the head Gone are squared off backs with remaining whiskers below the hairline A licensed barber will provide the shape neck taper straight razor and hot towel experience befitting of the well groomed gent or young manIt pays to look well and this V's location and Darwin in particular get my vote for excellent work.
I'm not the type to bash someones way of making a living My wife and I went in there Sat nite We both ordered a BRC buritto and I also got 3 taquitos and she also got 2 drumsticks Her drumsticks were burned and asked to get others My taquitos were undercooked but edible Sun morning I woke up to really bad stomach isssues and my wife threw up I'm still not feeling well after 2 days and neither is she I'm really pissed off and feel bad for anyone else that received the same unwanted gift.
This place is like half movie theatre half bizzaro museum It's worth going to just for the weird statues and creepy wax figures that stare at you from every corner The movies are only three bucks so you can't beat that The theaters themselves are okay nothing fancy for sure and sometimes the sound quality isn't the best But hey it's three bucksI figure I'm paying $150 for the movie and a $150 for the entertainment of the statuesI just wish Pollack would open up a museum of his whole collection I hear he has a ton of stuff I wanna see it.
I have over the years bought hundreds of tires from this location for both personal and company truck use  The service is consistant  They don't make a major effort for you to spend more than is necessary for your needs unlike other places I've been  The company is also very good about honoring the warranty they sell on their tires with very few questions asked   I once when in after I had  blown out both  the tires on the left side of my car at once when I swerved to keep from hitting a child  The tires were two weeks old  No questions asked they replaced them for me  I only had to pay the negligible cost of a new warranty for each tireI am also impressed by the fact that you see the same employees here at a later date  In this industry to keep the same employees over time is quite a fete I believeMy only complaint is that during rush hour getting in and out of this location is a challenge   However it is a plus that there are some many places you can go if you don't want to have to sit and wait while you get your tire situation resolved  That's a real plus in itself  I just suggest going in off hours if you can.
It is true I like their pizza - or maybe it's just better when you eat it here while relaxing and enjoying a beer.
Food- taste horribleService- 1-10it gets a 4UFC fights- plenty of tv's to watch the fights.
Love the small town and family owned feel of this place The staff was sweet attentive and prompt even on Mother' day.
Very good food Stopped for breakfast on a rainy morning on a friends reccomendation Great food and very friendly service I would recommend to anyone and can't wait till I am in the area again Best hash in town.
This place is terrible Staff is slow not familiar with things A couple days ago I came in alone ordered one smoothie The woman proceeded to take the order of the large group behind me before starting to make mine wasted ten minutes there Went back today got a smoothie and flatbread Opened flatbread when I got home took a bite totally smelled like cigarettes In the garbage it went I guess they don't wash hands or wear gloves Won't be back ick.
Great hidden gem for vegetarians + the best service in town While we veggie folk know that most Asian places will substitute tofu for any dishes in lieu of meat we also know it is hard to find a place where the tofu isn't a crappy tasting substitute that they don't really want to serve  This is not the case at Ling and Louie's The fried tofu in just about everything and in every sauce is delicious I kick it way up the spicy meter with 2 or 3 dishes of chili paste and mix that in with my (off the menu) Evil Jungle Tofu It is so good that I am actually happy that the portions are too large for me to finish I can nosh on this dish all night  well after I've left the restaurant I'm a pretty simple beer and whiskey drinker but I my wife loves the great drinks that they make here They come in blue red purple and green  I don't know what's in them but she loves themThe servers treat you like family and are always extra nice to our little one They don't put a hot plate in front of a 2 year old like most restaurants and have a vast selection of items for the mini me in your life The staff is always quick to grab a high chair a few crayons and a fun kids menu  Every time I've been it's busy  but not uncomfortably so We're always sat quickly and never rushed The decor is cool and it's casual enough for the entire family and nice enough to impress a date Don't miss out on this one A real 5 out of 5 - Jason -.
Z's has by far the best chicken pita I have ever had  They are very generous with their serving sizes  Along with their great food The staff is super friendly  My time at Z's always leaves a smile on my face and a happy tummy.
I have a serious crush on every Williams Sonoma but this one in particular is close to my heart The staff is always very friendly and welcoming to me anytime I shop there I've had fun buying items off our registry with gift cards and when the toaster we received didn't work they happily exchanged it for a new one Like other Williams Sonomas their quality of products is great but they also incorporate a local feel into their shop as well They host artisan and technique classes on the weekends and when they do they bring in local products to use during their classes and the local chefs to do the demos It's a great local touch.
An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party  They're always running a deal so look for one before departing  One year we did an annual pass  It was a good deal  There are also lots of special events that include deals  One time we met spidermanThere are lots of rides mostly for shorter kids  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall  There's a train carousel mini-coaster tea cup ride an up and down parachute ride several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (eg planes cars and helicopters and futuristic flying machines) and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides but not others and it also depends on the age of the child  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel but kids don't notice and have loads of fun  The arcade is really rundown but the ATM is really nice  There isn't much shade so be prepared  All of the staff are really niceThere are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game sand art and/or face painting  All are a big hit with the kids but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece  Everyone is a winner at ball toss by the way.
Amazing service from a family owned and operated business Their attention to detail is unrivaled We had to put a sick cat down this week Because of his problems he was urinating all over the house Scott and Chris Dial brought our house back to 100% in a couple of hours at a shockingly reasonable price Their enthusiasm for their craft is visible We won't use anyone else.
This is our new favorite place The food and drinks are great  On our first visit they gave us a card for a free appetizer or dessert So we went back on Sunday 8/12 and on top of the free appetizer we were given a manager discount of 20% off My fiance loved the tortilla soup I loved the cheeseburger on brioche bun The salads are innovative Can't wait to go back.
Another example of what a great spring training ballpark should be You cant tell that this ballpark is over 40 years old This ballpark has character along with great seating lots of parking and a team that should make some noise this season in the AL West Grab a beer and get comfortable in this gem of a ballpark.
What is up with crappy customer service in this town  I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot  Don't get me wrong I love spice we have a multitude of hot sauces chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection  My companion loves loves loves things spicy but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish just burning lava well it is simply to hot  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up  Um no please just take it away  He didn't even ask if we wanted something differentHere is the kicker when he brought our check the dish was still on it  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back  His response "Ohhh sorry  It does say spicy on the menu"  I couldn't believe it  I got charged $1495 for a dish we couldn't even eat  Totally lame  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off  I won't be back.
I love this farmers market  Sure it is smaller then some of the other markets but everyone is very friendly and they are ever growing  It is the best one in the SE valley for sure  Thanks to vendors such as Desert Root Farms One Mill Farms and Rhiba Farms (wheat grass specialists) it is a must for my eating and juicing needsThank you to the operators of GFM Jessa and Dan for a great job in keeping it friendly and to a high standard.
I d like to start off by saying that this used to be a great Hallmark for mailing packages until they hired this gentleman named Mike who runs the back mailing office I hardly ever write bad reviews on a place unless I feel there was a major problem that needed addressing in this case I have to say that Mike is probably the rudest individual I have ever come acrossI needed to mail off a package that was oddly shaped He overcharged me by almost $80 I thought this was way overpriced so I went home and hopped onto the USPS website plugged in all the dimensions weight height length etc right from the receipt Mike had given me It came out to a mere $39 and change That's a huge difference to I went back immediately and I asked to speak to his supervisor and he told me she didn' t  like to be bothered she wasn't there she's never there So was he basically telling me he could just do what he wanted back there I'm sorry but this person running the mail counter does not know anything blamed the computer and is more than likely overcharging customers on a regular basis I wanted to discuss it with him in a calm manner and he started getting very huffy with me and then told me to leave or he would call security I went to a different Hallmark store about 65 miles away that handled USPS mail and they charged me exactly what the website showed the first timeVery disappointed in this Hallmark and will not be returning I will also have to tell everyone I know not to go here either In fact my step-mother had an equally unpleasant run-in with this same clerk about a week laterIf you don't like customers Mike then I would recommend a job where you are not required to interact with them.
My husband and I used to eat at La Parilla in Mesa often However our last experience was the worst ever We had out of town guests and took them here for some good Mexican cuisine Our waiter was incredibly rude and acted as though he could not be bothered with us Everything was an inconvenience to him We asked for extra napkins and refills on our water and he acted as though we asked him for a kidneyHe took his time bringing us water and forget about getting a refill on our chips Apparently he could not be bothered to do his job We were mortified and embarrassed at how we were treated His name is "Rodriguez" (at least that's what was printed on our bill) The food was delicious but the waiter's attitude ruined what would have been a great eveningI tried to let the management know what happened but their email has conveniently been full for weeks We will NEVER go back to this place We'd sooner eat at Taco Bell then to be treated as poorly as we were FIRE RODRIGUEZ.
Let me preface this by sharing that I don't even live in Chandler and I'm sure I will be back at Brunchie's Yep it's true My fiance and I deemed this spot as worthy of the 45 minute drive it takes to get there from where we live in North Phoenix But I'm ahead of myselflet me begin by sharing that I was not a happy camper this morning as we left for our Sunday Brunch tradition Late start unexpected stops blah blah blahit seemed like everything was preventing me from getting food in my tummy Despite my grumpiness we made it to Brunchie's and sauntered inside I was pleasantly suprised by the short wait which my grumpy self was extremely grateful for (but note that it was about 12:30 when we arrived) The joy of perusing such an appealing menu while we waited also helped tremendously The bad mood was subsiding Then our food came and seriously I couldn't remember being grumpy in the first placeThe fiance tried the special of the day the Wild West Burrito and he was more than impressed The size of the burrito itself was hefty and every bite had a generous portion of fillings This place was not sheisty with their carne asada Bonus points in my man's bookI ordered the most hearty meal that my empty stomach was craving - chicken fried steak Ummtalk about homestyle comfy cooking The gravy was legit - creamy flavorful and with bits of sausage The biscuit was large and in charge and just as legit as the gravy on it Even my potatoes were delicious - definitely not the Ore-Ida frozen in a bag kind The chicken fried steak had quality all over it down to the perfect breading and thickness of the cutlet Imagine the Denny's version on super steroids - better quality and flavor for sureThe fiance and I even shared a short stack of pancakes (so we like having both the savory and sweet parts of brekky can you blame us) which were fluffy and hit the sweet spot craving Obviously we couldn't finish all the food in front of us and honestly that was the only thing we were upset about - NOT being able to eat every last bite because we were so happily full alreadyLong story shortwe were happy with our Brunchie's experience From the short wait the service and our food we left the place extremely happy campers We felt like we had just had a great huge homestyle meal just like the ones my dad makes when we're visiting How much more comfy and happy can you get Like I said we plan on making the trek back here again in the future because it's THAT good.
HUGE fan of the Tempe location from my days at ASU so was psyched to hit up the Scottsdale location when I was in town last week Still hard to beat the Schwarma lavosh wrap Would love it if they opened a location in SF Come on please.
Absolutely the best pizza in all of Arizona Locations in Ahwatukee Tempe N Scottsdale and North and Central Phoenix you have NO EXUSE not to go My only complaint about Spinato's is I eat way way too much every time I go God Bless the Spinato family.
Great taco shop Must get the tacos Been back a few times and haven't found anything that I wouldn't order again Great food fair prices.
LOVED LOVED LOVED this spot that works great for lunchThe clean fresh decor was very inviting service was phenomenal and the FOOODDD was fresh flavor-able and great value for the priceThey have only been open 3 months and I hope more people will notice that they do a great lunch service as well as Happy Hour and loungethat serves food until 1:00 amI had the House Dynamite that was aptly named because it was DY-NA-MITEThe sweet-spicy sauce on moist chicken and crunchy vegetable was perfectly prepared  My friend enjoyed the Pad Thai with tofu that could have used a little marinading but the noodles and sauce were perfectWe will definitely be back.
The Najaf sauce was excellent We loved the enchiladas and the nachos It was so gooood Love the margarita mugs too Definitely will go back.
I don't scare easilybut I'm not immune to dread:)There are a few things that make me break out in a cold sweat:* Circus Clowns - I mean reallywho thought this was amusing in the first place* Any of the "reddish" colored PT Cruisers - Careening around always filled with 90 year old snowbirds and always micro seconds away from hitting somethingI just don't want it to be me:)* Outlaw motorcycle gangs - as opposed I guess to non-outlaw or in-law motorcycle gangs:)* The Maricopa County Sheriff - "Your papers are NOT in orderve haf vay's uf makink you talk"* Airlines that have lost the will to live - United Airlines comes to mind:(I have a lot of miles logged with good old "Untied" Airlinesfor a few years I flew in excess of 250000 miles per yearthat's more than many of their pilots:)And they treated me wellalways in the front of the busfree use of the Red Carpet Clubextra miles for flightsall kinds of nice stuff:)Then I hit a milestone with UALa million mileswowa million mileslifetime Premier 1K statusyayThen UAL hit a milestoneand it hit it hard:(All of sudden I wasn't 1K anymorelifetime or otherwiseI wasn't flying very much and the program that they had in place "vaporized" at some point during UAL's lean years:(and because the service was crappy and the attitudes and pricing at UAL were worse I pretty much quit flying them altogetherLet's fast forward to nowI've been flying a bit more lately and found myself back on UAL a couple of times recently (heyif a client is buying my ticketthey can put me on whichever airline they wantexcept for Aeroflotthe only airline that truly I'm not even kidding terrifies me)UAL has really taken a tumbleI have trouble coming up with anything positive to say about them other than "we landed safely":(I've seen cattle being trucked to the slaughterhouse treated with more respect and dignity than UAL and its employees treat their passengers:(I didn't see any smiles or witness customer/employee interactions that were pleasant the last time I flew these guys (a couple of years ago)it's worse now:(It seem everyone that works for UAL is unhappyPolite requests for information ETA's ETD's are met with snarls and stony facesinquires about seat assignments are greeted with smirks and almost open derisionthere are no "pleases and thank you's" in the cabinapparently the sole objective of the flight attendants is to keep you seated and quiet or to collect revenue:(On my last flight with UAL I saw a rather substantial flight attendant (in her early 70's I estimate) intentionally ram the drink cart into a man's anklehis crime was dozing and having a foot in the aisleshe snarled at him to keep his feet under the seat in frontso unpleasant and so nasty:(and so protected by federal lawthe same behavior at Safeway would get her arrested for assault:(It makes me wonder about the pilotsare they so unhappy that one of them could decide to see if a 767 can bore a hole through a mountainprobably notbut the thought scares me just the same:(I understand why all these folks who work for UAL are unhappythey've all had their pensions ripped away they have taken massive salary cuts their dreams have been dashed (it may even be that the only people still working for UAL are people that couldn't get hired anywhere elsesadly:(So they are not going to be giving their bestmaybe they are even looking to take it out on someoneI don't knowI fly other airlines that have had financial problems (Frontier to name one) and the people you meet are all still friendly and helpful:)And there are still good airlines around that treat you pretty well and get you where you need to go with a minimum of grimacing:)At UAL it seems that it has become all too easy for the airline and its employees to take out their frustrations on the passengers soone sad little star for the founding member of the Star Alliance:(.
FREDS SCOTTSDALE  Great place quiet atmosphere no kids no teensdining in this is the place to just relax and enjoy  The staff the chefs andthe management is great   The food is wonderful i recommend this place all the time  You will not be disappointed at all.
Love it  Have been going here for years and they have never disappointed  YUM.
I agree we should have tried it a lot sooner  Great food  Every thing is very fresh  The chicken gorganzolla is made with a real cream sauce you can taste that clearly  The fried calmari were tender and delicate  Very friendly and competant service.
Great pizza nice crispy thin crust great sauce best I have had since moving to the valley  Service was also good will be back for more I highly recommend giving them a try.
Funny there were more flys than customers in the Starbucks just a tad bit uncomfortable.
I have been eating at Los Dos Molinos for over 25 years can't get enough New Mexican style hatch chile flavor (HOT)  The food taste awesome but beware it will make the back of your neck sweat  Enjoy.
After seeing all the good reviews of this place on here my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try She ordered the veggie roll and I tried the What The Heck roll The presentation was very good and both of our rolls were simply delicious we'll definitely be coming back.
good pizza good service.
Since Jeremy started fixing my computer it has worked better than when it was new  My computer was just a year old when I lost the hard drive and DVD/RW  It was still under warranty so I got the part and left the rest to him  I am not computer savvy so I am glad I found him  He does amazing work and does not cost near as much as any of the large size computer department stores.
So Yelp is so solid an' rarely lies on stuff it's so great I moved to Phoenix in the recent past and of course needed a new "go to barber" I am MUCH MORE particular than the average guy I guess when it comes to haircuts so I think that should say a lot for those who aren't and need a solid cutTHe first time I went I decided to go with Arsen(he cuts hair at the end furthest from the door) Not only was he good and has never disappointed since I been back but he is even known for cutting a fair amount of famous peoples hair Especially around Spring Training when all the ball players are around (GO GIANTS) =)Anyway if you want a guy who will fade your hair perfectly do exactly what you want AND even suggest ideas as well Arsen and Scottsdale Barber Shop is your place.
It was real treat finding a local restaurant with so much history and tradition The Stockyard is a landmark and I'm so glad I dined hereOur waiter was really informative since he's a native of Phoenix and knew the history behind this establishment Check out the the beautiful hand carved Mahogany bar in the saloon It's pretty amazing that this sits on what use to be the largest cattle auction stockyard in North America This stockyard would pass 40000 cattle through here per daily during cattle auctions  Enough history on with the foodI made reservations for 7:00 pm and we were seated at a plush leather booth I really enjoyed the decor here from the stain glass to the large ceiling lamps which contained hanging branding irons We were greeted with a relish dish baking soda biscuits and corn poblano muffins The raw veggies were fresh served with ranch dressing and the biscuits and muffins were warm and incredibly delishFor my main entree I chose the 12 oz prime rib which actually seemed larger and was a thick cut The entree included soup or salad and a side which is a rarity now a days with all the absurd priced Ala ca rte steak houses The house salad was solid and the blue cheese dressing delicious My prime rib was cooked to perfection - medium rare with hot Au Jus and the potato gratin was also delishCurrently The Stockyard was offering the centennial dinner which was a bargain at $4000 it included a incredible tasting pear salad campfire sirloin steak with whiskey peppercorn sauce grits cowboy chili made with Chorizo and roasted corn The dinner included dessert and we went with the warm pecan pie with bourbon flavored whip cream - OMG it was the BOMBOverall a great dinning experience with excellent service and quality I would definitely return here again.
Ask Jimmy to make your burger spicy  It's AWESOME  Food and service is the best we experienced in Phoenix (and we tried all the big name restaurants).
Excellent food Remarkable service Beautiful atmosphere One of the best steakhouses I have visited n the last couple of years.
The service was appalling They left us on the back patio and forgot about us  When something was said they didn't seem to care  We left and went to Phoenix City Grill.
Visits to AZ are never complete without a stop at Four Peaks  Fresh beer great food great atmosphere and helpful staffWe have been to both locations and hands-down the Tempe location is where to go to people watch hang out sip some tasty adult beverages and eat some tasty food  On the weekends it gets packed with people so go early  Scottsdale was a nice place on a Sunday to watch football and enjoy a casual --albeit quite afternoonBoth locations rock  When the Mrs asks to go there (the salads and light adult beverages are her thing) that makes me a happy camperIn support of local independent breweries keep up the great jobHope to be there soon.
Best Dentist I have ever been to  Friendly yet professional  Dr Phan is awesome -).
I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again I would rather eatat the worst Applebee's in Americavending machine foodmy own fleshNow Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids Really How do you clean all that crap The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway So if you have kids who like to drink you might have a good time here Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.
Hamburger HeavenIf you have been searching for the ultimate char-grilled burger served with hand cut fries and kosher pickles THIS IS THE PLACE Not only does this 12 oz "slice of heaven on a roll" satisfy the most finicky of hamburger aficionados (like my boyfriend and I) they also have the most fabulous dinner menuThe atmosphere is rock solid contemporary comfort with hand signed guitars hanging at each booth The music AND the food is second to no otherthis is NOW our favorite place to "rock out" anytime we are craving a burger fix which is at least once a weekNOTE: my boyfriend claims that most reviews are not realso if anyone questions the validity of this review feel free to contact me as I assure you this hamburger is the real deal and I am NOT associated in any way with this restaurantDid I mention that WE LOVE THIS BURGER LOL.
Yumm That definitely hit the spotI was a bit confused by their menu but it's pretty simple There's not that much to choose from but everything on there is G O O DI had the combo and 1 dollar soda (free refills) This is a moms and pops shop I love it It totally deserves a 5 star C'mon ppl.
I had the unique opportunity to witness one of Anthony's Brush Parties for kids Such a wonderful concept to watch the kids experience art in a whole new level and have so much fun in the process Anyone with children should definitely consider this as a great option for a birthday partyand if you don't have children scoot on down for an adult party I will gbe coming back for one of those very soon :).
Top Notch I went here with a friend after a nice early evening of window shopping around the biltmore looking at things that I would either never buy because they are hideous or just way over priced but I must say the biltmore is so choice because it brings out the finest people and oh how I love to people watch So after a rough day of browsing Enter stage right the Cheesecake factory  I don't exactly remember what I got but I do remember sitting at the bar The beer was really really cold which is a huge plus for me the food whatever it was was delicious and the service was excellent I will say I had a great time because some how the next day I ended up with a cheesecake factory pint glass in my freezerand I know I didn't get this at the novelty station :) In any event I am giving this place 5 stars I would suggest going there if you can for good spirits good times and good food.
My recent trip to Snowbowl had a bus breakdown half way through Of course not DSC's fault as anyone can have a breakdown but still made us lose time & they had to deal with a bus full of unhappy customers They handled it very professionally provided partial refunds and discounts on the next trip They provided extra beverages & did a good job at making a bad situation better They played movies up & back and all in all it was pretty fun I'll never drive to snowbowl again - this is a great service and I for one will tell all my ski buddies about it Sure the staff is young - but they're also alot of fun too Thanks guys.
I like this place I like the friendly helpful staff and their check outs Prices are reasonable for the most part good selection of dairy free alternatives cheaper produce then our local grocery shops Never bought anything that I haven't been happy with.
Island loco has the best crab puffs evercrab rangoonssaw them at 4 peaks brewerythe new one in the industrial park in tempegood beer and great streetfoodthey are there like once a week.
3rd ThursdayWOOHOO  what a concept I really love it I just wish I know more local streets to figure out and plan better for the game but it's tough for out of towner like me Still I had awesome time running boozing and chillin with likeminded folks in Tempe I agree with other Yelpers BEST to buy the shirt & beer mug kit before the race  Oh and store workers were great very knowledgeable and had good selection of shoes & items to empty out my wallet before my flight home thx Get some.
Thanks to Yelpers we took the leap and had lunch here  I'd seen it before  bright shiny and  looking conspicuously like a former Five-and-Diner on Baseline  I'll admit the exterior was a bit off-putting but Yelpers inspired me to give it a shot and I'm glad we did  As mentioned in other reviews the lunch prices can't be beat  The hummus was fantastic - strong tahini and lemon flavors  The falafel most certainly is not from a mix (or if it is I'm betting it's in a language I can read nor speak)  The rice is uber simple but fantastic  I don't know why  Perhaps they ground up fairies  Fairy dust or no we'll definitely be back.
This place rocksI tried BevMo and it was OK but Total Wine is the place to go their prices are the lowest I have seen their selection is great I like several types of liquor but have never been a huge fan of winesThat changes every time I come to this storeThe wine tasting has really taught me how to select wines The staff is great There is one person there (sorry I don't know his name) that I have gone to a few times and said this is what I am fixing for dinner and this is what my guest like I want something newHe makes recommendations (usually less expensive than what I was looking at) I buy them and my guests are thrilledIf you are looking for a relaxing afternoon out of the heat go to one of their wine tastings (some times they taste other liquor too)If you want beer selection go thereThey have several Gluten free beers alsoI have to stop myself from visiting the store whenever I drive by Its just that good.
Never Again My husband and I decided to try this place because we were in the area and wanted hot pho on a cold night My pho was terrible The broth tasted like it was ramen noodle broth which if you've had good pho you know should never be the case And then to make the experience even worst a cockroach started to crawl on our table and almost into our food The server who I believe is also the owner came to check on what was wrong and when we told her there was a cockroach her suggestion was we move to another table But at that point we had already lost our appetites We paid and left The server/owner apologized again as we were leaving but I was surprised she didn't comp our meal being that we didn't really eat If you want pho I suggest you go somewhere else where there is some attempt in making it taste authentic As for the cockroach wellI know Vietnamese restaurants are kind of notorious for being dirty so that should be your call if it's a deal breaker.
All I had was their Sangria so I dont know if I can really rate them or not but based off of their sangria definitely 5 stars Good service also My friend and I got a pitcher of sangria and its house made and the pitcher has a bunch of fruit in it no ice which is good bc sometimes the pitchers has so much ice and hardly any drink I was a fan.
Mas Vino I've been looking for another fun wine hang-out this may be it They have a huge selection of wine priced from $10 and up for a bottle (store prices not restaurant prices) They also have a vast selection of craft beers too Looking to have a glass while you are there - no problem They have 4-5 coolers of chilled beverages they have some non-alcoholic beverages too for the designated drivers Wondering about bringing a group The bar seats about 10 the various tables inside seat about 15-20 and then there is the big outside patiowith heaters mind you - that seats I'd say 15-20 plus lots of standing space so you can take turns with the seating if needed Food Selection is very limited for purchases you can get a little cheese plate for $10 It's a wine bar afterall but they seem to be cool with bringing in your own food so that's coolI was told on special event nights they do have a selection of appetizers though They have a TV behind the bar I'm sure you could talk the bartender into putting on a game etc when I was there a movie was playing Staff is nice our first visit we had Patrick helping us out behind the bar He also helped us to find a bottle of wine based on our needs and description so don't hesitate to ask there are so many bottles to choose from and they know their wine I'll be back Cheers.
Hmmm Bait and switch Got a flier from a representative from this place and they won't honor their advertisement It's says that you get a custom pizza and salad made from scratch all at a respectful price of 775 I thought that was a great deal until I called and the guy who answered said it was either or not for both Sucks because I heard that their pizza is not bad but I'm not going to spend my hard earned money at a place that won't honor their mistakes Good luck Fired Pie.
Fantastic location for a nice dinner and a great place to host an event The food is awesome and the atmosphere of the restaurant is darling It's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a good meal with some Southwest flairWe had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and reserved the Cocktail Patio Admittedly it was hard at times working with John who is the group events coordinator However the extra time and patience does pay off because our rehearsal dinner was a very fun evening in a beautiful area reserved for just our party with great food The service was just okay we had much better service when dining normally at the restaurantmust be because of that automatic 22% event gratuity Some standout dishes:- Three Sister's Salsa & Trio of Hummus: They both come with the same AMAZING fry bread that is a must I personally thought the salsas were on the bland side and much preferred the trio of hummus which were more like thick brushettas as opposed to traditional hummus-  Entree Salads especially the Harvest Salad: These are the biggest salads I've ever seen The Harvest Salad is exceptionally - tons of macrona almonds fresh fruit delicious cheesea really refreshing and filling salad- Vegetarian Gemelli Pesto Pasta: Delicious vegetarian entree There are a good amount of vegetables bathed in a wonderfully creamy pesto sauce It's a very satisfying dish- Ancho Chilli- Rubbed Filet: My husband loves this dish He says the flavors are amazing and the meat is cooked perfectly I can attest that the side dishes it comes with are delicious.
When I first dreamed up how this review would go I intended to say "Chicago dog fans your savior is here" and leave it at that The problem with that is I've tried some of the other offerings of Lobby's and have realized how much more they have to offerYes absolutely this is THE place to get a Chicago-style hotdog There are other hotdog joints but none of them seem to offer an authentic Chicago dog experience You will not find a single ingredient missing and it is all made fresh right before your eyesHaving said that there is far more to Lobby's than just the dogs Their fries are amazing and extend into "how-will-I-ever-eat-anything-else" territory with the addition of chili and cheese They also offer a burger made for bragging rights: 3 lbs of delicious cheeseburger Finish it quick enough and you'll have your picture added to the hall of fame Plus the staff is always very friendly and the place is always immaculateWhen my 3-year-old nephew dined with us here he had a plain hotdog He smashed the bun flat against the hotdog and told me it tasted better that way That's not particularly important for the review but I wanted to share that anyway So there you go Lobby's has quickly turned into one of my favorite go-to restaurants.
This is a beautiful and great grocery store/ deli I would compare this store to a Bristol Farms maybe Everything was clean and put together really well We were greeted by one employee who asked us if we wanted a wine tasting and so we did and we were happy to find out thetasting was free Awesome I came out of his store really wishing we had one in californa in my neighborhood Next time I'm in AZ I'll shop here again.
I was surprised that they have such a great happy hour they call it Aloha hour  But come early because it gets packedThe chocolate souffle is a MUST every single time I go to Roy's  Order it early because it takes them a little while to make the oozing cakes of goodnessI could live off of their souffle  Can't wait to come back for more.
I eat at this place all the time when my family is hungry and for something fast I'm not going back and I don't recommend to anyone We went there tonight with our kids for there 50 cent cones and play in there new play area The kids ran into the play room to play while my husband and I went to the counter to order Barely anyone inside and no one at counter by us There was only one female in grey uniform who had head phones on came up to counter my husband said hello and she did not give us the time of day took a cookie and walked back to kitchen We stood there for another 10 mins and no one came up to us and said anything We took our kids out of play area and went to McDonalds down the street I will never go back and I hope they fire the lady due to her poor customer service.
Came here for a celebratory dinner for my friend There were about 15 in our group and we were seated outside on the well heated patio We had five heaters around usWe had two servers who were super efficient They got drink orders in and out with each guest/s that arrived at all the various times The group started with 2 orders of the chicken nachitos loaded with yummy guacamole that were quickly devoured For my main entree I ordered the surf and turf tacos which consists of lobster and filet mignon I like the fact that Chelsea's Kitchen offers gluten free options without extra charge but I still went with the corn tortillas that come standard with any taco entree option Holy delicious I can't even accurately describe the party that went on in my mouth The dish came with a kale salad guacamole and pico de gallo There were two dipping sauces aioli and a salsa type the aioli came out on top and landed on every bite that went into my mouth I really wanted to lick the little container it came it but I had to pretend to be a lady The filet was cooked medium but looking back I should have gotten it prepared at the medium rare temperature because the outside was pretty cooked For dessert I split the sundae with a friend and I love that you get to put your own toppings on When you order the sundae you get two sauces: carmel and chocolate and three toppings: rainbow sprinkles (or jimmies for my East Coasters) Oreo crumbles and chocolate and peanut butter chips So fun to create your own dessertThe service and food were spectacular (especially for a large group) and I can't wait to come back for another meal.
Great great sandwiches.
Oh man  So good  Went here on my birthday and went all out with the rock lobster and filet combo  Holy crap  It is amazing  We also had crab cakes as an app and my boyfriend got the crawfish ettouffe (sp)  Everything was super yummy the server was great (Thanks Alex) and the restaurant ran like a well oiled machine  Can't wait to go backPS- get a Bellini.
WOW I just drank the grossest most vile beer of my life   I've seen Frat initiations that were less gruesome OK Take a beer feed it to a paying patron Let the ass of it mold and dry out then use that old moldy glass to serve your next customer When I showed the waitress she looked terrified and tried to make up some excuse that it came from the keg when clearly we could see what took place here Later the manager came over and apologized as he was shocked I had already consumed most of the vile beer before looking into the infectious glass Oregano's you should be ashamed Feeding honest hard working people this sh*@ is disgraceful And I hope this post helps another hard working family avoid such a dreadful experience.
This place is incredible  Really great service delicious food and drinks and the manager even came by to thank us for coming in  The fries were amazing the chicken and waffles was amazing the beers were amazing the pretzels were amazing  the only thing that wasn't so amazing was the check at the end of the night but I'd say it was worth every penny.
Rory and Kristen take care of you like family  AND they take care of your car tooI have never had a problem with the fixing my carand it is ALWAYS cheaper than the next place  They care about their customers and want you satisfied with the work that they do.
Great place - friendly staff great live music love the couscous & chicken I keep saying I'm going to try something else but then I know I'll miss this tasty dish Best to order it & share w someone who orders a pizza Such a gem Love it.
Exceptional food and serviceTook my in-laws to Christopher's to celebrate a retirement and had an even better experience the second visit  The food was perfectly prepared top quality and tasted superb Josh was our server and managed our experience perfectly-- courses landed together drinks never emptied he was great with our 4 year-old and was intimately knowledgeable about the preparation of the options  Couldn't ask for a better dinnerOnly odd thing is that this restaurant is in a high-end strip mall and splits with a small bar  Not bad things necessarily  Just not things one sees often  Then again ZinBurger is also in that mall.
It is what it isIt's not a bar or a night club  It's a big brewery with a tasting room  And as that it's perfect  It's in an industrial warehouse setting with an interior view overlooking the production equipmentThe place is about parking your butt for a while sampling their brews and getting a chance to try new stuff that is hard to find elsewhere while cooling off and munching some pretzels      They do offer grilled sandwiches which are remarkably good and an excellent value at $5-6 eachI try to stop in everytime I'm in the area and I think you should too.
Thai Mix (red curry) I dont know what this is but it's not Thai  Bland and not even similar to Thai red curry  If you want Thai food hit Royal Thai Grill or Thai Rama  I would have been better off going to Panda Express which makes me cry a little on the inside.
I've been to a number of car washes in this town and Lindstrom's is the finest As a self-professed neat freak and perfectionist I can assure you that your car will be well-groomed at Lindstrom'sThey are not in the habit of upselling and pressure tactics - just pressure washing They are friendly willing to accommodate my needs and clean without frills I have been coming to their car wash for some years and continually come back (even when I stray wash my own car or pick one of those gas station car washes on the fly) Lindstrom's seems a little sad these days and emptied Not sure if it has to do with the recession the brutally hot Phoenix summer or the recent raid on their service staff by the Sheriff's office for "identity theft" But whatever the case Lindstrom's provides a superior service and is a local business and for those two reasons alone please frequent this establishment Your car will thank you.
I love this park always something fun going on  I love the ponds and I like sit by the waterfalls and think  My dogs love going there with me and they love to check out the ducks  One of my favorite places in Gilbert.
I really love this place It never fails to be high quality and delicious My only complaint would be the amount/type of seating but that is just a mere location issue And as far as cheese wiz vs provolone or whatever people use on their cheese steaks I think it's however you prefer it and I know people from Philly that take it both ways.
This has become my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for a nice dinner out  The menu was very unique and they serve generous portions unlike most of the Scottsdale restaurants  To start our party had 5 people and we had reservations on a Saturday night  We were seated immediately upon check-in something that many of the nice steak houses and other restaurants still can't quite figure out  We all started with a glass of beer which they have a great beer and wine selection  They carry many great choices at reasonable pricesOur group split the quesadilla of the day which was very good  It changes so I can't remember the actual ingredients but one of the better quesadillas I have hadFor the main course I had the pork porterhouse which does not appear to be on the menu currently  It was great  The side came with potatoes au gratin but was a very unique taste and this alone would bring me back  I also sampled the mushroom pan-fry their signature dish  This was absolutely great and I may order this when I come back againOverall a great restaurant in Old Town  Make sure to have reservations though.
I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey melty fake cheese  Also they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings)  Very tasty.
I'm a regular customer of Fair Trade and I usually have nothing but good to say about it Just ten minutes ago though I stood at te counter for about five minutes watching one employee talk on her phone When the second employee came out from the kitchen she returned to a plate of food I have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers but I left without being served and I wonder if I should ever return I have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service I will think very hard about going back which is too bad considering the many days I've spent there.
Perfect place for a staycationTo be fair I chose Hyatt Gainey as my top choice for my bachelorette weekend primarily because of their spa (see my review for Spa Avania)  While I'd been to Hyatt Gainey years ago (before their renovation) I had never really spent time at this hotel nor had I stayed there before  So needless to say I was in for a treat  And so were my friends that came to spend the weekend with meThe service at Hyatt Gainey was top notch from the bell men to the reception the barista at the coffee stand the servers in the restaurant  and at the pool and of course at the spa  The room we stayed in was spacious and perfect for our group  We had four girls on Friday and planned for five on Saturday I  know you're thinking that there's no way that many girls could share one bathroom and you're right - we used the spa to shower and get ready instead of the roomWith all of our festivities we ended up not being able to see the live music that everyone raves about nor did we get a gondola ride  More reason to return for another staycation spa day or just a visit for drinks sometime soon.
College Times is not just for college kids (damn I'm sure the sales account executives aren't too thrilled that *my* liking it undermines their demographic targets but whatever) Granted the first few pages would be of more interest to students because there are pictures of local events and stories that a non-student wouldn't care about (eg transfers class credits courses the bar scene etc) HOWEVER setting all that aside the "Calendar" section is still more informative and chock-full events than the New Times (Yes I'm referring to the 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times) The 'dead tree' paper edition of New Times only lists one or two events per day The 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times by contrast lists more events per day So their event listings are better The 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times seems to have much better - not infinitely better but noticeably more comprehensive - music coverage In addition to featured new releases of the week there's a "Weekly Six Pack" sidebar of notable new releases and another sidebar for "Download This" suggested tracks to download Their reviews also have "Similar Sounds" below the review which seems to be like the "RIYL" (Recommended If You Like) tags you see elsewhere Frankly I've always found RIYL to be unnecessary If you can't tell what a band would sound like without someone having to give you an example you're either seriously musically illiterate or whoever wrote the review is seriously musically illiterateIt would be good if some of the features like "Weekly Six Pack" and "Download This" were available on the online edition.
This just might be the best restaurant in Arizona Seriously.
Wow So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed It's really not that hard to please me with food especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night I ordered one of their specials which was the pork enchiladas When I got the tray I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos with mole-like sauce First I had to decipher if it was fried which was later confirmed Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label It had a sweet mole yet bitter taste with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream I know    strange you say The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split The beans tasted hallow if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry I am sorry to give this such a harsh review but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate pecan thing they gave at the end Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.
MOJO yogurt is just fab Love the flavors love the toppings love that it is all self serveThe only thing I don't love are the giant cups It always makes me buy too much And then eat it My favorite flavor so far is the cookie and the mint one.
Phenomenal meal as always We have a number of good Vietnamese restaurants in Philadelphia but we don't have a Little Saigon Make sure you don't miss this gem.
For a Bar Zuma has some excellent food Not the typical bar menu We try to eat at Zuma when we are in downtown Tempe or before events/concerts etc the Management and Bar Staff are very social and friendly etc  Love the bottomless Mimosa specials on weekendsHave not been there for the nightlife/late night but I hear they pack em in.
I've never had a bad meal here  It can get crowded once you taste the food you will see why  We love the entire appetizer menu  You could also try the vodka penne de parmiaeverything is so good  Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour from now on   YES  I wish we lived close  We would be here all the time.
Ate at TK's Urban Tavern several times and the food is great The pulled pork sandwich is a home run a must try Sampled the mac & cheese onion rings shrimp & pasta dish fresh roasted chicken homemade pretzel and the desserts- all were delicious The ambiance makes this a perfect place to meet and dine with family and friends Loved TK's Urban Tavern It's a wonderful dining experience Try it you'll love it.
Great bagels great chopped liver and very friendly staff  Great deli.
Best acai bowl in Arizona Jamba Juice acai toppers don't countI think they blend grapes into theirs which really thins them out Thrive makes them perfectly and uses fresh ripe fruit I would come here everyday but my wallet would protest It is a bit of a splurge for a broke college student but definitely worth it Friendly staff and great acai bowls.
I've been going here for many years Actually since well before the new owner(s) came in and renamed it Stray Cat For a long time I really enjoyed the drink and dinner specialsI've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year Earlier this year I brought some of my visiting family to the business because the food and service had been so awesome to that point For some reason they had a useless cook working that day who burnt everything he sent out to us  twice The owner on site was so embarrassed after we showed him what was served he offered us gift cards to cover our food My family vowed never to return I figured it was a fluke and was impressed that the owner acknowledged the problem and did something to address itIn June I went in on a Monday and ordered a basket of chicken wings To my surprise they were completely out of wings I ended up going elsewhere to eat that night and sent Stray Cat a private message on their Facebook account letting them know what happened A month to the day I received a response "That was a busy weekend for us We never want to let a loyal customer down Hope you'll be back to 'Fix' your wing cravings soon"In August I went in on a Sunday and again ordered a basket of chicken wings I was stunned because they again were completely out of wings I sent a followup message to Stray Cat via Facebook letting them know of the pattern and advising they should speak with whomever is doing the product ordering Their ENTIRE response:      "Maybe eat wings on Friday or Saturday when we're fully stocked"WOW I immediately went to the bar and requested to speak to the owner who had ironically "just left" I gave a printout of the messages sent back and forth to a server who knows me well told her what happened and asked to have the owner contact me No contact what so everIf this is how they treat a longtime patron now imagine what this place is headed for Save your money for a business that actually cares about the people bringing cash through the door That snarky message was it for me I'm done.
I was at a business meeting at a Starbucks in Scottsdale one afternoon and I smelled something wonderful I couldn't keep my mind on the business deal because of the aroma of some very delicious food Whatever they were saying was not even important I could only think where was that food smell coming from The meeting was finally over no doubt rushed along by me and I walked to a little eating place a couple of doors down I peeked in looked at the menu then cancelled my plans that night and came to a place that would become a favorite I still get a little tear when I remember my first ossobuco there Veneto Trattoria reminds me of the small friendly little places that I have been to in Venice where the food and the ambiance combine together for a memorable experience I have been there many times--alone with family with friends with business associates--and each time has been wonderful Last night It was a little cold outside so I had the gnocci to warm me up The plump potato dumplings tasted homemade and the meat sauce was delicious One of my buddies had my all time favorite Veneto Trattoria dish: ossobuco She let me taste hers and like always it was to die for The veal shank and the risotto make a perfect flavor combination Others at the table had the sausages and the pork chops Of course I mooched a taste of those too Mmmm Don't forget to have their salad with walnuts and goat cheese It's not on the menu but they will make it for you if you askHere's a tip: become a regular I go to Scottsdale for business several times a year and Veneto Trattoria is always on my list Whether you travel to Scottsdale or live there you should go to this spot whenever you can Once you've been there twice they will treat you like family.
Still head over hills for The Mission  I have even made a pit-stop on the way home to kill my sweet potato fries and grilled street corn craving (I know carb overload)  They just added a few new things to the menu one of which is the black cod loved it (hopefully that can help balance out my love of the carbs)  Be sure to make a reservation because the cat is out of the bag on the locally owned gem.
This place is so delicious It's such a chill environment dress up or don't it's totally up to you And the food Well it's delicious south-Mexico style food You must try The Español for an appetizer but you can never go wrong with the guacamole either And the paella is just delicious but be prepared for left-overs Oh and don't forget the drinks Bloody Michelada or a Margarita both are great.
Thanks to Flashbash my daughter's first birthday party was a success Allison came in and set up so quickly The equipment was so easy to use Their prices are great and they were very efficient Thanks.
What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale Has it all from ambiance to service They use as many local products as possible great bruch sparkling wine selections Prices are great and portions spot on This place is must try I will be going there again.
I am a fan of Top Shelf Mexican Food because of the chips and salsa and for their rendition of my all-time favorite food: a bean burro enchilada style The taste is awesome to me The waiter Nate/Nathan was very friendly He had the orders memorized for some of the patrons The burro is $495 with enchilada sauce (I like the red sauce) The drinks root beer etc are $250 and they have free refills My total was $812 for these two items I would eat there five days a week if my budget allowed it.
(Wait =7 min) + (Inspection = 3 min) = 10 minutes total I arrived at 6:45p on a Monday night There were 2 cars getting worked on  I've been at this location once before 2 years ago and I didn't have a long wait then either The manager was super friendly after I'm sure was a long day I will keep coming to this location.
We chose Mastro's on a whim last year when we were AZ for Spring Training We had such a great experience we decided to go back My husband and I shared a delicious shrimp cocktail and ordered the petite filet which was melt-in-your-mouth perfect Brussels Sprouts were excellent But then I nearly passed out--through NO FAULT of the restaurant When I became dizzy the staff stepped up to calm and care for me Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER If I was going to have an emergency this was the place to do it Everyone was so concerned and caring The manager called the next day to see how I was doing That being said I'm disappointed we didn't get to stay to for dinner as the food at Mastro's is superb.
Sorry  not impressed with the pizza  greasy  could not finish the 1 slice I ordered  Salad was blah  free popcorn had no taste no salt no butter  blah  not returning.
We love this restaurant Great service Freshest food in the west valley The pho is quite possibly the best I have ever had Try the spring rolls You won't be sorry Go therenow.
i just finished a two year lease at the Heritage honestly the only reason we stayed so long is that we were on the 3rd floor moving was a b---ch the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly the dishwasher sucks big time the pigeons overtake your balcony toothis place is not built very well they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything (however one time they did put us up at a hotel) there is no bike rack and you cannot leave your bikes chained anywhere outside your apartment the security gates are always stuck open so anyone can come in several of the residents are continual beggars and bummers of cigarettes and coins who loiter around the mail boxeshowever i loved the pool area as hardly anyone ever used it while i was there i did have some great pool parties but there isn't a restroom by the pool so it was a constant hike upstairs for the loo the windows are so thin that you hear each passing wind bird and rattle from your neighbors doors closing shut i would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the blackouts beggars and continual shake of the window if your an east coaster this might be the place for you because you can hear everything your neighbor is doing in their place too.
this was such a fun trail it's a pretty good workout it'll definitely get your heart pumping there's no water at the trailhead so plan accordinly also the hike back down can be pretty slipperly with all the gravel so be careful.
Everyone knows the spa is great but what about the poolI'm a bit biased because I don't technically have to crash this pool I have a key  My family has a home right next to the resort so I've had the ability to use their pool since I was bornPersonally I think it's worth it to spring for a spa treatment while your there and take advantage of the adults only pool  Otherwise the pools are not much to look at  The Jackrabbit Pool attracts more kids and poolside service ends at 8pm (sometimes 4pm in the summer) but I believe the pool itself is open 24 hours  The other pool the Garden Pool usually has less kids and also has poolside service Basically this is a valley establishment and that is why I like it  There are probably more exciting pools to crash but this is an old standby  Also it is currently undergoing renovationsUpdate:  I guess you don't need a key anymore- so feel free to walk in like you own the place:).
I have been  a client of Business Needs AZ for about five  years now Paul Demos is extremely knowledgeable and capable He has found tax deductions for me that I didn't know I qualified for I highly recommend him.
Walked in last nite around 630 sat at bar Dining room was busy but bar quiet Horrible service dirty glassware Rude bartender Mushy albacore sashimi coulda used a straw to eat itDidn't order a entree  left.
I have a love/hate relationship with this place I love that they have everything you could ever want for cooking or baking but hate that my wife wants to spend hours there asking my opinion on different types of rolling pins and cupcake decorationsThis place really is a one-stop shop for cooks and aspiring chefsRobert Pfeifer.
Carolina's has the best tortillas in town hands downI'm going to pretend like I didn't read some of the reviews about the place being in the "ghetto" and not wanting to be there after dark etc My office is just across the street and while I will admit that the neighborhood is different than the one I live in I've never felt nervous about being there Most of the residents of the neighborhood whom I have met and worked with are hardworking individuals just trying to make ends meet Ok that's the end of my soapbox tirade Moving on we eat at Carolina's quite often since there aren't a whole lot of other options within walking distance and I'll be damned if I give up my covered parking space in the summer I actually like the "cafeteria" type style of the place and will occasionally eat there instead of ordering food to go I love the Machaca burritos and the breakfast burritos are to die for (and at $3 a pop you can't beat it) Bottom line I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food.
I am a Gilbert boy and I have been eating here seemingly my whole life I take ALL of my out of town guests here especially when the weather is nice and we can sit outside Great vibe always super friendly staff and the best BBQ I have ever had hands down This food is made with love.
I'm flying from phoenx to orlando tomorrow  I have seat 33 my daughter has seat 16  I've been trying to weeks to get this changed  Now i've been told to get to the airport as early as possible.
Oh Hao Bao you so tasty I was finally able to try Hao Bao at downtown's Food Truck Friday and boy am I glad I did I ordered the Street Treats (chicken) and the original dumplings (pork and shrimp) The wait seemed forever since there were so many people vying to get some delicious food The truck was having some trouble keeping up with the orders but everyone was real friendly and the food tasted so good Definitely worth the wait I took mine to go and slowly savored it as I drove off Pretty soon my delicious lunch was gone and I was wishing I had some more Truth be told it was really filling and I could have shared Not that I wanted to but for future reference or if you are a light eater you might want to shareI'd definitely go again and can't wait.
The Barracho Burro is amazing  Also if you love Pollo Fundido then you absolutely must try theirs  They give unlimited chips and their own unique salsaIt's not really greasy and "unhealthy feeling" the way some fast-food mexican food can be  You get large portions with high quality ingredients that taste amazing  I moved out of state but if I come back I'm here for nearly 2 meals a day no joke.
I can't say enough about this great spot We were here for drinks and cookies (made next door) Even though this place is always busy it doesn't take us long to check out Everything is 5 star.
Outstanding coffee  Very yummy cookies available   Great coffeehouse atmosphere It's a bit hard to find - no big obvious sign this isn't Starbucks.
What a great place for lunch The pecan grove makes for a really nice setting for a picnic and/or a party and they do have them there The food is very good The Grilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich Curry Turkey Salad Sandwich and the Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich are all incredibly awesome sandwiches.
Good price and big facilityno sales pressure just good workouts.
My 10 year old ordered the chicken - after taking a bite and saying it tasted funny - I looked to see raw chicken - took back & complained - gave us a second order which ALSO came out partially raw  They didn't even check the 2nd batch  after a lame excuse and a manager that had no clue what to do we left -  DO NOT order chicken  Hoping my son doesn't get sick tonight.
Friend took me here when I was visiting and didn't have any idea what I wanted to eatjust that I needed some foodand a beer sounded good too  This place is great  Cool atmosphere and good brewsI got the Tap Room Tenderloin and a Hefeweizen to wash it all down  Both were very good  Also got to sample a piece of their tasty quesadilla  All good and I look forward to sampling more of the menu in the future.
OMG THE CREAMY RICE I can't get over how delicious it truly is some blend of white rice sour cream grilled onions and magical unicorn horns or something because it is awesome I always get the Chicken Fajita Rice Bowl and it's great every time The chicken is always tender and perfectly cooked the vegetables are greatand now we all know how I feel about the riceI've heard their fish tacos are to-die-for as well but I've never had the opportunity to try them because I'm so loyal to my beloved rice bowl The ambiance is super cute too this is just a great place for a quick bite to eat or for takeout The counter people/runners are always very friendly and helpfulsometimes almost too helpful We had one food runner who loitered near our table the whole meal and kept asking us if we needed anything it got to be a bit much - but that's okay I'd much prefer that to being neglected as customers so often are these daysThe Deluxe/Zen 32 folks have another winner.
Fast service seat yourself Got drinks right away and ordered food right away Place is nice and modern feeling Smells good Place has a patio and a bar Best background oldies music Not a fan of jalapeño Mac and cheese but that's just me:) The jalapeño taste is not for me But I'm sure people love it The fries were fantastic I ordered the brisket and it was amazing Wife had the pulled pork sammy and she loved it and almost ordered another Over all good experience we will be back regularly.
I love this place I've taken everyone I know and love here And no complaints from anyone so far My Anglo friends like the food and so does mi familia  Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja Rocky Point and Cancun you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs And with over 200 tequilas to taste I look forward to tryng something new every visit.
The coworkers were nice they recommend this delicious plate called the BBQ Katsu mix and the homemade sauces were amazing as well Will come back soon.
This place is the SH*T Alex the owner is cool as hell Real kick back shop and real professional I've had the same Berber for 5+ years but I moved north and the drive was killing me I gave "The Spot" a shot and homeboy delivered Great cut hot towel AND a shoulder massage (no homo) for $12 Even his little bald friend cut really good Hey if u live in the area and need a good fade or whatever then check this place out It's definitely worth it.
Awful food and service Went for breakfast Food was cold And bland Then they charged me for someone else's food and blamed it on their "system" instead of their incompetent staff The manager (Lisa) was completely unhelpful and never even apologized for their screwup I wish I could give it less than one starIn sum pretentious overpriced restaurant thinks they're better than you Skip it.
Rating the golf course horrible  Thank goodness there was no one in front of us and we zipped around the course  They clearly stopped maintaining the course  Bunkers are concrete after a few times in them I decided to take it out and not bother hitting it  No grass around the greens and the greens couldn't hold the ball worth a darn  One green did have gravel on it I putted the ball and it wiggled all over the place  I'm glad I only played there for 15 bucks which included the golfnow fee  If your a horrible golfer I'd play there.
For a while we have noticed that customer service has gone way down hill We had several bad experiences with the competitor right down the street from us and decided to try another store Not only was this store clean and the prices were very reasonable but the staff there is what makes this store phenominal On a random oh we need dog food trip we decided to go to Pet Smart on Elliot We walked in went right to our pet food with easy to find shelving and unfortunately they were out of the size we needed Within 2 minutes a polite employee walked by asked if we needed help we asked if they had the smaller size from a 35 lb to a 25 lb bag and he said he would check At this point we decided to try a different flavor but of the same brand it was at the price we usually spend else where and was the size we needed Upon the employees return he stated that they were all out but offered a solution which was selling us the smaller bags 3 which would equal the same amount as the bag size we needed for the same price as the bag size offered We did the math later and it turns out for about 24 bucks you get 5 extra pounds of food then you would normally going that route I was so blown away with not only the friendliness the willing to help but also the offering of a solution We bought the other flavor thanked him for his effort and made our way to the register which we were greeted by a nice employee who even struck up a conversation about the pet smart card which we forgot and asked what kind of pets we had When we got out to the car we both had smiles on our face we couldn't believe the effort the politeness the treating a human being like a human being It is now why we will only shop at Pet Smart Petco on 48th had some bad customer service but compared to Pet Smart it was horrible service Shop only at Pet Smart the cost and savings are better the employees actually want your business and are willing to help anyway they can.
Want to get a party poppin' With over 30 flavors to select from one can find a flavor for any occasion  I've been in there a little bit too much getting snacks for the office as well as snacks for clients/meetings  A mini is a great size to try out different flavors  From savory selections like Beer Cheddar Sour Cream and Chives fruity flavors Strawberry or Pineapple to sweet blends Kettle corn and Butterfinger  Love the Puppy Chow mixture of popcorn chex mix and pretzel sticks in sweetness  Can't decide Try the Scottsdale blendWhite Cheddar and Carmel YUMMY  Hidden inside the strip mall totally worth checking out.
WOWI love this Food Truck  Devin & Cat are everything you hope to encounter when walking up to a food truck for the first time  A real 'small business' eat local type feel and the warmth you would expect from a family run businessOn to the food:I have only eaten 1 item from Q Up  and as far as I am concerned it could be the last thing I ever eat in my life  This sandwich is RIDICULOUSThe Gangsta Grilled Cheese could quite possibly be the best sandwich ever created  It includes ingredients like BBQ Mac & Cheese and Sourdough  Need I say more  Anyone who doesn't like this meal is crazy  Also worth mentioning that the BBQ alone is top notch  The sauce is perfectly balanced and the meat is so tender and delicious I think it might be made from unicornsI could go on and on about how much I like the experience from Q Up but am getting hungry and they are not out right nowI am a bit of a Food Truck Junkie and tend to be a bit critical Q Up Passed with flying colors  Keep up the good work.
My boyfriend and I were apartment hunting in Ohio for a week and Brenda was an enormous help in taking care of Mo and Mew She came to our home even though it was a little out of her service area and made sure the girls were fed walked and played with Brenda is fast on her feet and even noticed some things that we had forgotten to take care of before we left Her communication skills are awesome and I felt like I knew what was going on at home while I was away She even sent me a text on one of the first days of her visits to let me know that Mo and Mew were doing great I really feel like my fur kids couldn't have been placed in better hands.
I needed a new starting motor for my 1981 Kawasaki They had one It took a little time to find one but I am guessing they have one of everything even for a 30 year-old bike Everyone is extremely friendly and knowledgable If you don't know how to replace a part they can definitely show you how They even test parts for you to make sure that the part you brought in was faulty I now need a new speedometer Bob's will see me again this week.
So my cousin and I decided to get tattoos in memory of our kick ass Aunt Leslie  My cousin is from Michigan and I am from Napa Ca  We were here for a short time  We found Lucky Lady Tattoo and immediately knew this is the place we should go because of the women artists  We called and Marge set our appointment for the next day the last day we were both going to be in Phoenix  When we walked in the shop we were instantly calmed by the decor very laid back  Marge proceeded with much care and caution  While I knew exactly what I wanted my cousin needed a little time to decide  Marge listened sketched colored edited with sooo much patience Marge's work was quick and beautiful By the time we left not only did we have exactly the art work we wanted but we felt like we gained a friend Thank you so much Marge.
It's the best Mexican food in the valley.
This place is awesome Delicious food Portions are slightly on the smaller side but the quality is so great that it makes up for it Seriously you cannot go wrong with this one Great atmosphere as well Cool decor.
My  ex-hubby and I used to frequent this place in 1991 when it was called The Lone Star It was awesome thenand it's still just as awesomeI moved away for 20 years and when my ex-mother-in-law came into town we decided to give Texaz Grill a try not even thinking that it was the same place Boy Were we pleasantly surprisedNothing has changed Not the decorations not the menu not the friendly staff not the quality of the foodNOTHING Ok I'm lying There was a different picture on the back of the ladies room doorWe all ordered the Ribeye with the house salad/house dressing homemade mashed potatoes and cream gravy I've dreamt about those mashed potatoes The steaks were perfect Juicy tender flavorful cooked to order Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this placeWe finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce Trust me you've never had bread pudding so good Full of cinnamon raisins and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauceIf you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill You won't regret it.
Decided to give it a try "which was the first mistake" got a burger with bacon and cheese Its amazing that how you can take a patty of beef and scare out all the flavor so it resembles something like ground up cardboard The bacon seemed like it was sitting around for 3 days I had to overpay for this I wont be back.
Small burger Small fry Small drink = $10Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good  Bun "collapsed" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger  The patty/cheese was fine I guessbut I didn't get any real flavor from itFries -- They use "real" potatoes but the fries are flavorless  But at least they're greasySoda -- Kudos for a good selection including two diet-caffeine-free choices something I've never seen beforeI'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys)In summarythis place is the emperor with no clothes  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're greatthe reviews are all over the walls  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying.
Thank you Ocean Air came highly recommended and now I know why Excellent fast friendly service Reasonably price AC maintenance and FAST response if there is a problem.
Such a Disappointment I love Fox Restaurants so I was uber excited to finally check this place out We started with the Guacamole It looked amazing but was bland and flavorless I ordered the ahi tacos and they were "meh" Now my guy and I LOVE desserts but were so disappointed with what we had why bother hitting a disappointing trifecta Great decor great service boring flavorless food.
We went to our first show at the Orpheum Theatre last nightI thought the theater was absolutely beautiful I loved the intricate architecture It felt old but stately It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere The sound was wonderful as well  We saw Jake Shimabukuro ukulele virtuoso there It was a perfect venue for him So beautiful stately quiet with great acoustics It really highlighted his performanceI found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles After a while it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997 They brought back much of the original design (moldings murals etc)Now it's just wonderful Anytime I see something interesting playing there the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw Can't wait to head back.
Secretos is our favorite to come to when we're here in Phoenix The food is amazing We love the booths and the service and hospitality  are first class.
RUN AWAY I would of given back the 25 dollar gift card if I could of avoided the food poisoning.
I used to come here all the time during high school Inexpensive food great greasy burgers the fries here are delicious They have many different flavors of milkshakes  I usually get the butterscotch  No restrooms limited seating space I recommend getting your food to go.
This is my favorite restaurant  Their chicken mole is SO GOOD  The papa con carne chili relleno and fish tacos are amazing as well  NOTE:  The Taqueria's are not as good as this the original restaurant  The quality of the food is not even close  I recently moved to another state but whenever I come to town to visit family they know that a trip to Tia Rosa will happen  I have to get my chicken mole fix :)  And I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and during the winter we always eat ourside especially at Christmas when it's decorated  Try this place atleast once  Don't get the usual chimichanga or tacos try one of their specialty dishes and you'll enjoy your visit so much more  ENJOY.
Went tonight and had an AWFUL time due to a few staff members All went all right before the horrible encounter with a staff member named Christina (a server) Got there early to play some games and then take up the awesome $799 unlimited bowling after 9PM Christina came up very friendly and nice on her first trip over but as soon as she realized we weren't going to rack up a large alcohol tab she soon lost interest After getting some water 10 minutes after we asked for it we decided we felt bad not getting anything else to drink so we ordered a Shirley Temple she brought that to us without even letting us know she just put it down and left After our friend finished her drink she was ready for a second We waited about 30 minutes before I finally had to go up to Christina to ask for more As I walked up to her I get to see her sitting with some customers on her phone She rolled her eyes when I asked for a drink and then proceeded to tell another server Stacy about how "rude we were for asking for a drink when she was clearly busy" As she is telling her she points us out and Stacy rolls her eyes at us as well We finished our games and it was nearing closing time so you would think she would be getting her tabs ready but no she was flirting with more customers sitting at their couches and ignoring her PAYING customers I then had to ask another server for our check who happened to be Stacy to my surprise she was at least friendly to my face She was upset as well to see Christina sitting on her phone AGAIN She made her get my check and I gave her my money and asked for change because we were not going to give her a tip clearly She slammed my change down and walked away without saying anything That was the point I realized I needed to let the company know that they have a bad seed ruining their paying customers experience at an otherwise fun and friendly place I then went up to her to check her name and the other co-workers name Her response was  said in an extremely rude tone with a roll of the eyes and a smirk on her face This was completely unacceptable I would LOVE to hear from a manager from this location to discuss the poor behavior this employee displayed as well as the poor experience that me and three others paid to have My email is rebeccarwoods@aimcom Please contact me.
My wife made us go here--right smack across the street from ASU  Sooocash only place-fine we knew this  Best flame grilled juicy burgers ever  My wife can't have beef so she had chicken breast--lovied it  My burger was the best everand the toppings buffet was ice cold and the burger toppings all well chilled  Just awesome  Left very very satisfied and happy she made us go  Will DEF be back :).
My daughter has been at Mountain View Christian Preschool since she was 4 months old (She's 20 months now) and I can't say enough about how much I love this daycare The church is Christian however the daycare curriculum is non-denominational Every single person at the daycare is passionate and cares immensely about children I know that when I leave my daughter there that she is going to be loved just as much as if I cared for her myself I've never had any doubts that this was the right choice for her and I'll keep her at Mountain View until I either move out of the area or she goes off to kindergarden The facilities are clean bright and newer and they have a nice playground with a shaded covering for playtime There happens to be a house right behind it that has mini-horses goats and sheep so the kids can watch the animals through the fence but they can't put their hands through It's sort of like having a zoo right in the backyard They do water play days during the summer with the hose and buckets and those are by far one of my daughter's favorite activies My daughter has gone through the infant room to the infant 2 room and now the toddler room and the developmental level and curriculum has been stimulating for her and she's learned so many new things The spend a lot of time coloring reading books doing art projects and learning to say please and thank you There hasn't been a TV in any of the rooms she was in so I know they're not just plopping her down in front of a video all dayI know every teacher there by name and the school arranges potluck dinners and get togethers so the parents can meet each other They make a real effort to make the daycare a community center instead of just a business Overall this place is the best I pay a little more to have her at Mountain View than I would have at other daycares but you just can't go cheap on something like this When I was pregnant I checked out tons of less expensive daycares in the area and was pretty scared Mountain View Preschool does NOT take DES vouchers and the clientele seems to be a little more upscale because of that This place is worth every penny and I recommend it to everyone I know.
Today I went to this location as well as the location at Arizona Ave to pick up school supplies for my kids  THIS location was very well staffed and I was easily asked 3-4 times if I was finding everything I needed or if I needed any help  Really great service and the place was very well organized - yes I was finding everything I needed everything that was in the back-to-school ad  Prices were comparable and often cheaper than Walmart next door  A successful back-to-school shopping experience especially with the $5 off a $30 purchase coupon teacher's discount and $2 per old binder discount when buying a new binder.
i was having a rough and stressful day and very hungry  i was craving chicken and only place near me  KFC what more is there to write about it says it all KFC  should i talk about rude employees should i talk about how dirty it was or maybe i should talk about how nasty the food it was ummmmm  well i was hungry and i was not planning to drive so i ordered grilled chicken  okay"sigh" here is the problem i didn't care much about  rude customer service place being dirty or order took little longer than usual  but all i wanted was juicy tender grilled chicken with my hot sauce and wash it down with ice cold soda  am i asking too much here can a man take the time and enjoy his life a littlenah i was asking too muchchicken was soo dry it can pass for beef jerky come on now at this point i realized and understood why some people gone insane and start shooting i really wanted to throw my chicken at the staff who prep it  now i know why they call it KFC killed for chicken.
This place is a killer find and I can't wait to go back again to try their new menu that they introduced yesterday  We went on Monday and the place was jumping  A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine (they have a very eclectic wine list) and the food was AMAZING  Although the bar is a totally cool place to sit the next time I want to sit on a patio I'm heading here  Great job.
Food is great and so is the customer service  The garlic lemon hummus is the best.
Great service  Great atmosphere  Did not eat so can't comment on that.
I grew up in the South eating copious amounts of delicious soul food and as an adult I have traveled a great deal in search of places that can still do it right and I am here to tell you: THIS IS IT folksThe food is indescribably delicious and well executed and the staff could NOT be more pleasant and attentive but one of the most important reasons to high tail it over to Lo-Lo's is because this place is a rapidly vanishing breed and a foodie experience you won't ever forgetAbandon your diet forget counting your cholesterol and treat yourself to a meal that will make you weep with pleasure  Life is too short for Subway sandwiches when a temple of deliciousness like Lo-Lo's graces this weary worldAnd this I vow: I will never visit the city of Phoenix again without stopping to eat at Lo-Lo's  And I can't wait to experience Mrs White's Golden Rule Cafe.
I love this place  I bought my car used in Phoenix and had it shipped to SF  Arcadia Car Wash took care of the detailing before it was shipped over and when my car arrived it looked brand new  Several of my friends even commented that my car had "new car" smell and were shocked when I told them my car was used  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a very regular customer.
My wife and I and our two son have for years gone to Haus Murphy for Christmas Eve dinner  We all have lived in Germany for an extended time and a German dinner for our family and our son's wive and girlfriend so a Christmas eve German dinner has become a tradition  The year before last the woman who runs the place didn't treat us very well (a party of 6)  We tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully  We all decided that our experience with Haus Murphy has come to an end  It's a shame but each time the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we'd made reservations for 7:00 but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door  Even something as simple as bread with dinner was with heldPerhaps any other time of the year but not on Christmas eve  If they don't want customers on the 24th they should just close for the day.
They may have the best pulled pork sandwich topped with delicious slaw in townEverything about this sandwich said finish me all and you'll be stuffed miserablebut you can give it a tryI might suggest they throw a little more fruit on the plate just to make it look like a decent attempt Otherwise I love this newly decorated spot and will definitely be back.
Best food super friendly staff and great prices Love it.
If you have someone in your life that has celiac or any type of wheat or gluten allergy this is the place  Their bagels waffles and herb bread are works of art made with love i don't know how they do it and I don't really care I just LOVE that they DOThe waffles are my favorite and my girlfriend that has severe celiac is obsessed with the bagels  She told me this is all she wants for her birthday forever The noodles that look like egg noodles are a little mushy when cooked so I won't be getting those again but I was going to fill up on bagels and waffles anyway.
Always come here  Nice location and great coffee and chai  Nice outdoor seating  Friendly service.
I'm somewhat against Yelp reviews but this place is too great to not say anything Revolver Records is a gem Great and comprehensive selection with amazing prices Pleasing selection for y'all hard rock and heavy 70s freaks I bought eight records here: Atomic Rooster (Made in England) Alice Cooper (Easy Action & Killer) Deep Purple (Fireball) Uriah Heep (very 'evy very 'umble & Salisbury) and SLEEP (Holy Mountain AND Dopesmoker)--all for 100 bucks Those Sleep records are hard to find and priced expensively everywhere else I've looked Over 100 bucks a pop online I also spied some cheap Bloodrock and Judas PriestAdditionally the guys working here are real nice Thanks for making my trip to PhoenixOh and I forgot to mention the sweet pin collection by the counter A bundle of KISS ones too.
Just had our first experience with TIMO Outstanding Food ambiance service etcThe tapas are terrific and the environment is great Try the bruschetta the lamb chop tapa's  the escargot and the creme brulee You won't regret itFans of Postino's will find it a worthy competitor/alternative.
AmazingI ordered the Spinach Tortelloni and the ricotta filling was bursting at the seams drenched in herb-butter sauce Oh it was divineWe went here on a double-date and sat on the patio There was no dirt involved or flies as some of the reviews suggest In fact it was impeccably clean well-designed and relaxing We went on a Tuesday night so it was not very busyI am a fan of all Sam Fox's Restaurant Concepts and this one did not disappoint.
this is such a long miserable story all i can say is pick another airline.
I have dropped Zoe's down to one star because it was catered in to a work event that we had recently and I was forced to either eat it or starve Fuck you Zoe  following me around town  showing up at my work You're like a psycho stalker ex-boyfriend What's next A dozen red roses and some slaughtered animal remains Bitch.
most authentic japanese i've had made by real japanese people  (if u don't know most sushi restaurants and japanese restaurants are actually owned by koreans lols)  the guy is an old-skool asian guy not grumpy but not nice  he does what he does  atmosphere needs some music but food makes up 4 it  if u order a dinner u get a yakitori skewer and OMFG it makes the meal  lightly crunchy outside juicy flavorful chicken on the inside srslythe only thing i don't like is how sweet some of the japanese sauces are but that's my own personal preference.
YUMMMMM The atmosphere is so comfortable I especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers The food is excellent especially the pizza and I think its hard to find good pizza This is a great place for date night or to bring the whole familywe do both :)Great food at an excellent value with wonderful service What more could you possibly want.
So being of Hispanic origin & a true AZ Native I would like to think I am somewhat of an authority on Tamales Not really but I know what I like & I have tried them all over town I do believe that these really are the "Best Ever" I love the old standby pork tamales but I thought I would give the chicken and  the corn tamale a try They both knocked it out of the park although the Chicken one was" very" spicy the blend of green chili chicken & monterey jack cheese was a beautiful palatable combination Then to cool things down I feasted on the corn tamale which was savory yet sweet  I love that they did not sweeten the masa for this delectable treat as I was not looking for a dessert tamale Kudos to the chef now perhaps they could work on the dining room a little Never mind I will probably just get my dozen to go anyways.
A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well If I lived in PHX I'd be taking all my dates here Gorgeous cozy romantic LOVE ITThe bartenders are all very friendly and they are fantastic mixologists I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes they have FernetLocated at Sanctuary Resort you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gazeSWOON.
All night happy hour Yep Can't beat it In addition to their normal happy hour during the week they also extend it to all day Sunday and Monday The only downside is its only in the bar and front patio but hey for that deal you can make it workI got the green chili pork stew on the recommendation of the waiter It comes with a side of warm tortillas and is the perfect size for a filling meal without feeling stuffed The pork was delicious and cooked perfectly The cheese topping and the extra zing from the chilis made this absolutely delectable Definitely a must try If you want a go to place that always has great food great service and good atmosphere this is your place Will definitely be backagain.
The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives all while having a merry timeWhat's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century  Once you pass through the gates you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days  Men women and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing shopping and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment jousting tournaments over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing leatherworking weaving woodcarving blacksmithing candlemaking and potteryOne specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it  Here a family of three (father mother and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press  The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning  The categories range from mythological symbols to astrological to even ancient Egyptian  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin they place a blank either bronze or silver between each dye and clamp it to a press  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin  What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol  Additionally what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away making the production a very personal thing for the consumer  If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon which I would undoubtedly recommend be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
Welcome to CentPho Los TaquitosBeen wanting to check out Los Taquitos other location for a while then I saw they opened up at 16th/GlendaleWent for the street tacos Had 1 carne asada 2 carnitas and one each of the other pork varieties All were excellent very fresh crispy fresh double-tortillas The hot sauce is delicious and they brought a squeeze bottle to the table for me which is a big plus I also tried the Habanero sauce - not too insanely hot at first but the kind of heat that creeps up The whole lunch was $8 so I will be backBOTTOM LINE: Welcome to PHX I will be a regular.
To die for food and the atmosphere is adorable Great date night.
Words cannot describe how much I adore this place Over the past month I think I've been here at LEAST once a week John and Dave are the best bartenders around - always so accommodating and friendly My friend is Italian and has grown up drinking negronis (I'm not a fan but she is) and is pretty picky about how they're made John does is perfectly I always get either a Moscow or a Gin Fizz - they're always delicious The tots and duck fat fries are delicious I mostly drink when I'm here but I've had a few things I've tried their pork belly BLT toopreeetyyy damn good It's not a super busy place and I'd prefer it stay that way I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this place since I don't want a bunch of people there crowding my space and I really don't want the Scottsdale douchers coming through here.
I'd have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this one After reading the great reviews I thought this would be a great place to drop by this afternoon after school I called and found that the price for a gel manicure was very cheap and with that and the great reviews I was in The technician was very nice but that's probably the only other good thing that I will say about this place First off it was dirty not the station where my nails were done but around it The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it It looked very run down Also the selection of gel polish colors was dismal Very dismal They did not have the color that I was looking for (which I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear She cleaned up my cuticles alright but left quite a little bit to be clipped off But here comes my REAL issue Filing The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy It left them jagged uneven rough and dirty I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark She applied the polish and I left Looking at my nails after the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails I guess you really get what you pay for which is a real shame Next time I will stick with my usual place and pay a little more so that I know it will be done right the first time.
In Phoenix for a business meeting and loaded the food network app to find a diners drive ins and dives This place was first on the list What a gem to find Hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten Taco Tuesday so I got the el pastor The salsas were awesome and the heat was felt for hours Just like I like it I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taco fix Too bad that they aren't located in my home town because I would be there every day.
stacey hoffman is the best i take my animals there when they need a second opinion all of them have been to see her she took a rock out of my bloodhound's stomach and he walked out of her office that day like nothing ever happened to him she has helped me with my cushinoid dog and another with multiple extrahepatic shunts and pancreatic insufficiency she always gives an easy to understand straight forward opinion and is usually avaiable to answer a question or two when needed we are really lucky to have her in phoenix.
This place was good two years ago when it opened  I used to love it  They have since greatly increased their prices and decreased the quality of their pizza  We live in the neighborhood and the last three times we ordered pizza it was delivered cold  The cheese was skimped on and the sauce was almost non-existent  The crust was burned  The wings were well done on one side and almost raw on the other  The price for this fiasco came to around $30 - with the delivery charge  It was so bad we had to throw it out  What a rip-off.
When my sister asked me to buy some winter dresses for my nieces I inwardly groaned because: 1 These are items that are best bought in person rather than online 2 What do I know about children's clothing I don't have kids so I don't know the best places to go Off to search on Yelp and I found Love Child Resale close to where I live The store is small but they pack in a lot of clothing and toys in it all very reasonably priced After searching online and in various other stores I found that for some reason it's hard to find winter dresses in the winter Luckily they had the perfect dress in my niece's favorite color at a rock bottom price I picked up a long sleeved Ralph Lauren dress in very good condition (No tears or stains only slight wear from washing) a dress that is $45 new for just $550 used hereItems were easy to browse through as everything is nicely separated by size If I need to buy kid's clothes again this is a good place to go.
I have known Jennifer Y for many years She is an amazing (and fast) groomer She is the only one I trust my boys with fully She can get both shih-tzus done in just over an hour (I shave them both down with a #10 blade).
I think I have died and gone to DVF heaven  (That's Diane von Furstenberg for you non fashionistas out there)  Seriously by the time I was three racks into Twist I was melting into a puddle of bliss  So many DVF styles and patternsit should be illegal to sell that many in one place  My poor heart can't take itAnyways after I regained my composure and continued shopping I was greeted with even more fabulous dresses and tops- Rebecca Taylor Plenty Lewis Choit was pure heaven  The store is stocked with great fashion forward piecesnot fashion 4 months ago pieces I almost sent a text message to Dorian G telling her to get on the next plane and come out here to this store  I selected 5 things to try on and halfway through the super nice (and cute) sales associate came by with a few more dresses to try on  Everything he brought me fit perfectly and was right on with my style  I seriously wanted to buy 8 things  I restrained myself to come back with my husband to have him help me narrow them downThe sales associates were super nice the store is huge and full of wonderful itemswhat more could you want  Oh yeah I got a parking spot right in front  That was cool too.
The service at this store was amazing and the saved my wedding dress shopping experience  The first store I visited was I do I do and it was horrible  The service at An Affair to Remember is awesome  They are very knowledgeable about their dresses and are a full service store that stands behind their product  As the previous review states they only carry two lines but they are decent lines with good quality dresses for reasonable prices  If you like Maggie Sottero or Casa Blanca then this is a wonderful store to visit.
2 catfish burritos (one grilled one fried) and 1 basket of cajun popcorn (crayfish tails)OMG Awesome The two catfish burritos are surprisingly different With the fried fish you can really taste the deep complex flavors of the rice and beans With the grilled fish the blackened catfish flavor really steps up to the front Either way this is the best cajun food I've had--I'm no expert though--my taste buds were in love.
My home away from home  I used to live in Scottsdale and many family members and friends stay here always happily  I will be going back again next week  It's true the rooms are basic but they are always clean  The breakfast is huge and the shuttle service is wonderful  One Saturday night the guy called in sick and I had ordered it for that evening so the front desk young man paid for a taxi without a blinkWhat makes this place work is the staff many of whom have been there for many years  It is like a family  The competition right next door is more aesthetically pleasing but the staff is terrible and that means a lotthese people really care and it shows.
Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):n/a Food10 **Drinks**10 Service9 Atmosphere7 ValueThis new bar spot was just opened by the owners of the next-door Breadfruit restaurant (Jamaican food)  Same as their restaurant everything here is amazing qualityThey also punched a walkway into the wall between the two places so you can order Breadfruit food over in the RumBar as wellVerdict: over 70 quality rums (working up to 108) = YES**NOTE: Their grand opening isn't until Jan 27th  Until then they are still playing with hours & drink recipes so during this time all drinks are only $6**.
Surprised this place isn't closed by now Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came backTheir ingredients are not fresh gyro meat tastes old and decrepit They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me Literally by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating.
We went here for dinner last night and it was so amazing that here I am  first thing in the morning writing my review In a word Posh is AMAZING So much so that I can't wait to go back  Sorry Mark and Eddie but I think I just found my new favorite place Oh I'll be back to you but holy cow is Posh ever good As has been described already in other reviews you get a list of proteins and you can let the chefs know what you dislike and they will build a menu based on what you do like I pretty much gave them carte blanche although husband was a bit more restrictive We opted for the full tasting menu his without wine pairing and mine included wine The service is absolutely incredible Everyone is very friendly and non-intrusive although with selecting the full tasting menu we saw A LOT of our server  Several times Joshua Hebert the chef/owner served our dinners and he is a delight--very sweet humble and a refreshing change from some of the pompously overbearing chefs here in town (cough cough Chris Gross cough cough)The food was fantasticsimply utterly completely fantastic With the full tasting menu there were 14 (no that's not a typo) different selections that came to our table including dessert I included the foie gras and while others disliked the pairing of it with the berries I found it quite a nice compliment to the richness of the foie gras Each selection came just as we requested it be prepared full of flavor and never over done  Our dishes truly crossed the entire spectrum of food ranging from fish to clams to beef short ribs to sweet breads venison duck lamb and beef  We had the most delicious endive salad which was a homage to the wedge salad only bite size And we also had an amazing sweet potato soup that was velvety and perfectly done The only dish I didn't care for was the duck as the texture just didn't do it for me Husband likes his meats prepared well done and he got well done every single time--not burnt--but still moist and delicious Since I selected to have wine pairing each dish came with a different wineso yeah that's 14 different wineswell 13 because 1 dish was actually paired with a very nice beer Each beverage was perfectly paired with each dish Having the pairing did enhance the flavors of each dish But I guess that my 1 complaint14 alcoholic beverages paired with 14 dishes and this Mama was definitely drunk by the time we got outta there  By the last 4 dishes  my tastebuds were so inebriated I don't think I quite got the full flavor of those dishes I can tell you that those last 4 dishes had great textures and I'm pretty comfortable to say I liked them  The dessert of crustless cheesecake with meringues was refreshing because it wasn't so sweet (at least I think so haha)  The next time I go back I will probably just order a bottle of a solid all-around kind of wine instead of doing pairing simple because I don't want to be drunk every time I go there The only other complaint I have is that the restaurant gets very very loud The room is a wide open space with nothing to break up the noise And be prepared for the obligatory arrogant Scottsdale guy who thinks he's far more important than he is out with a woman who is so out of his league that he doesn't realize she's just there for his money There were a few of those but it does make for great people watching If you are looking for something differentsomething where you can just tell the chef this is what I don't like now SURPRISE ME Posh is your place I can't say enough great things about this place and I really can't wait to go back.
Dear Egg Rolls how I do love you here at Saigon Kitchen You are delicate flavorful and SUPER HOT It's hard for me to wait when you come out of the kitchen but I MUST because you burn the crap out of my mouth otherwise :) Love wrapping you up in a leaf of lettuce and mint leaves Love dipping you in the wonderful sauce You complete meWe also enjoyed the vegetarian pho today and my son had the filet mignon beef stew The meat in the stew was so tender it just fell apart It was perfectly delish The pho is what you make it to be Add the fixings and make it what you want it to be and stop complaining about it being bland It's SUPPOSED TO BE.
Great gluten free menu and they have kombuchaThe staff were super friendly and they were very accommodating to special requests (like my smoked salmon and scrambled egg with gluten-free toast).
I like this Safeway although I don't shop here very much  Prices on household goods and hygiene products are much better at Wal-Mart  The store is always spic and span and the employees are pleasant and helpful   A tip to other shoppers-go early in the morning on weekends to avoid the wasps (ie the Brophy and San Xavier) momsThose ladies in matching sweater sets are crazy drivers with their carts and their Suburbans  in the parking lot  They stop in the aisles and chat with each other oblivious to others trying to get around them.
My parents stayed here and thought it was great and so I thought I'd try it too After a really horrible day of car trouble and such a long drive the staff was super helpful and made me feel so welcome They really made the day much better and I cannot say enough about their customer service The rooms are also nice too which of course is great I'm sure I'll stay again and will recommend it to anyone who comes to Phoenix.
The man needed a dress shirt to go with the suit he brought for tonight's event and lo and behold we spotted this place and didn't have to deal with Arrowhead MallWe walked in to a sea of young men getting fitted for their prom attire and a salesmen immediately approached us-grateful to see a few crows feet I am sureHe was great-non pushy and helped us get a shirt and tie that was needed He even steamed the shirt for us so we didn't have to deal with it ourselves$7500 and not a single problem or waiting in line with all the "boys" Great service and EASY.
We came here the night before our marathon after looking at the reviews and then seeing they made fresh pasta  We were excited as we walked in The place has a cool look and our server was nice Negative 1 - there was absolutely no hot tea selection and the server had no idea what tea they had I usually never get tea but decided to this time The tea was some cheap brand and was presented completely unorganizedNegative 2 - the chop salad is not chopped and its more like a side salad on a large plateNegative 3 - the beat salad was more of a greens salad with some sorry looking off colored beets on the side The salad tasted like one big biteNegative 4 - the meat and cheese plate that says a selection of such is not so We received to thin slices of salume and two thin slices of prosciutto The cheese was cheese sticks and the majority of the plate was veggies The artichokes were the best on the plateNegative 5 - the so called house made pasta is either not house made or the cooks in back do not know how to cook pasta We got risotto with shrimp and the shrimp was so over cooked that is was inedible  Then we got the trio of pastas Tasted like generic microwaved pasta And was like mush We didn't finish either plateNegative 6 - we didn't want to attempt dessert and i wanted itThis place lacks any food luster We were so disappointed and bummed We couldn't figure out how we spent $90 I suggest if you must go to just go to the barI gave them one star because of the artichokes and our water glasses were never empty In conclusion this place is just not good.
Not sure why today was better than all the other times I always remember johnny rockets in cali having terrible service Pretty damn good.
My 10 year old got a pair of boots from my dad who has als Obviously these meant the world to my little boy but the heel broke of one I first took them up the street parodies family who quoted 4500 I could glue the heal for 175 myself He said he need to do both pairs Anyway I decided to get a second opinion and came here They fixed the one by redoing it for only 1500  I'm very happy and pleased with them The boots were probably not worth much but I was treated as if they were.
Not much to say about FEZ except they have excellent food and drinks I usually go with the sirloin and potatoes and its always good perfectly They also have a good selection of spirits in addition to a few special made cocktails Atmosphere is perfect modern and trendy without any holier than thou feelings Happy hour is every day as well go.
I give this one star ONLY because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order An apology for my order would have apparently been too much instead I got a "are you sure you called this location" Ummm You have another location I've had better service at McDonalds.
Ordering looks like a challenge at first bit it's not  Highly recommend the JENRED pork it's like sweet and sour pork but with a spicy twist  Portions are good and they serve your meal with a snickerdoodle or chocolate chip homemade cookie  It's a hole in the wall with super awesome food.
Dr Estavillo was key in connecting us to a pre-marital counselor in our area.
Staff was extreamly knowledgable on guns Love the museum aspect of the store Hard to not feel like an american when you walk through this place.
The most relaxing bed and breakfast in Southern Arizona  Linda the owner is wonderful  She really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay  And her dogs are charming too  You get so much more than what you pay for  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt toast fruit juice coffee cereal oatmeal all kinds of good stuff  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless  My favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock spa with a little waterfall and a grill that guests can use for BBQs  Lovely place to get away for a night or twoand really feel like you took a vacation.
I've got two words for you people  Well technically one word and one hyphenated slang term  Regardless it is FREE WIFI  That's right at the freaking nail salonI realize that I have issues when I judge my nail salons solely upon internet access but it is a beautiful thing when you can get a pedicure in the middle of the workday and not get busted for it because you are fully functional from your laptop the entire timeThat said it is also a nicely sized CLEAN facility that is surprisingly inexpensive considering it's location on the corner of Central Ave and Camelback  I used to pay an extra $5 in Scottsdale and at least another couple of bucks in Tempe as wellThe nail techs are all delghtful and speak english as well which as most of you know is not often the case  I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes before I'm in a chair with my feet in hot water including New Years Eve which is pretty incredible  My toes always come out looking lovely which is the icing on the cake  Price is right quality is right staff is right wifi is oh so right consider me a customer for life.
When I got home one day after work I found out my fridge full of food was not working I immediately started looking around for an appliance repair company hoping I can still get a hold of someone before 6pm Thank GOD I found Del Tech They came over within an hour and quickly fixed my fridge The tech was nice and professional  He also taught me some maintenance tips that I can perform at home.
I was disappointed in our experience After waiting for an hour for a table we were taken to the bar section of the restaurant which smelled like a fraternity basement I was also offended to see the blue tortilla's made in an open public area by an individual not wearing gloves Gross.
I had to write about the Orange Tree Golf Resort because I own a timeshare unit there  I bought a unit in 1994 and back then they were 1 of about 4 timeshares in Phoenix  Now it seems there are dozens of timeshares in the Phoenix area Currently the resort is in the porcess of upgrading all of the rooms so if you book there ask for an remodeled room  I haven't seen the newly remodeled rooms but based on the old style the rooms are great  The bigest complaint people seem to have about the rooms are the lack of a full kitchen  But keep in mind the Orange Tree was not built as timeshares rather it was a former hotel that went bankrupt The old units had a "college sized" refridgerator but the remodeled units will have a full sized refridgerator and flat creen LCD TV The bathroom is the best part of the units with a two person water jet tub and a walk-in shower and television  The resort is in a great location just a few miles from downtown Scottsdale or about a 20 minute drive to downtown Phoenix The on-site restaurant and bar are great and if you are a golfer the course is fantastic.
Been a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright for many years I've visited Falling water and Knob Hill (which is simply fantastic) both in Pennsylvania Also toured his home and other locations in Chicago I've yet to be disappointed The guides are always extremely knowledgeable and they have great anecdotes which help to make the tours fun My parents have recently moved down (snow birds) to Arizona and I look forward to taking the tour again in the future  It is expensiveactually when I went last year my parent's waffled on whether to spend the money because they weren't terribly interested  In the end they decided to go and they were fascinated and glad they took the tour It's worth it to support Taliesin and the conservation of these wonderful works of art.
This place rulesI love a non coparte businessescpcially locally owned and brewed beer and killer foodthe daily specials are the b*MBcometh staff is good to look at and always friendlythe managers and owner are always walking around making sure everything is okand you can grab beer to goperfectgotta watch out for that raj IPAstrongI call it "no knees"eat drink and be merryvi la vida.
I came her the other day with Abu J for a little stroll  It is peaceful and charmingly quirky all at the same time  Lot's of little paths to stroll on and whimsical architecture to take in  We will definitely be back for a bell soon.
Overall experience couldn't have been any better so I have to give a whopping 5 stars After a sad morning at the vet I decided to treat myself to some nearby coffee Heard a lot about this place especially how incredibly awesome the staff is at this location so we had to check it out Low and behold the truth has been told This visit actually turned my day completely around We pulled up and this super cool peppy chick came running (yes she literally ran back and forth to take orders and give them) out to greet us at the car while we were waiting in one of the drive-thru lines and gave us the rundown on the menu since we were newbies She talked us through our order we waited a few minutes and then pulled up to the window or should I say PARTY (I encourage you to take a solid look inside the shack if you have a chanceThey have a friggin' DISCO BALL inside for goodness sake) There was a really chill funny gal ready to take my money She actually had the ability to hold a good conversation while we waited for our drinks (there were none of those boring lulls or awkward glances where you accidentally make eye contact before your food is ready) And she even gave my pup a doggie treat OH Annnnnd gave us a punch card but punched all of the spots so that we would get a free drink next time Can't wait to go back I seriously left wanting to get a part-time job there just so I could become friends with the workers and have them in my life Haha You guys rockAnd the iced drinks were OH SO DELICIOUS Try the Annihilator You won't regret it.
Part 1:The Why:  A work of passion from a former stock trader turned restauranteur noca had been on my "to visit" list ever since I visited Phoenix for my recruitment in September of 2011 but unfortunately a chef shift right before I visited (and another thereafter) gave me pause  Owned by Eliot Wexler and considered by many locals 'in-the-know' to be amongst the best restaurants in the city I knew I would eventually make my visit but it was not until the high praise of new chef Claudio Urciuoli's cuisine and a ringing endorsement from Steve Plotnicki via facebook came across that I moved noca to #1 on my list  With a concept that seems rather straight forward - high end ingredients prepared with an Italian twist in a casual environment - I generally assumed that noca was going to impress and at a price point that seemed bargain basement compared to similar establishments in New York Chicago and elsewhereThe Reservation:  For the sake of full disclosure I have to note here that I was known walking in the door  Between Steve's endorsements that I must meet his friend Eliot and another local diner who'd apparently told Mr Wexler about me months before I figured it was only proper to introduce myself to the restaurant's owner prior to making a reservation - an introduction that led to a string of e-mails covering everything from sourcing to local general contractors and finally a reservation at 8:30pm on Saturday night (actually secured ~18 hours before the meal via Opentable)  What I hadn't planned on however was a stop earlier in the day to check out the afternoon 'nocawich' menubut hey why notThe Space:  Located like many Phoenix restaurants in a simple strip mall the exterior of noca is nothing to get excited about - it could be any random sports bar or billiards hall but what lies inside is actually quite sleek a sort of urban industrial feel but still sort of homey and laid back  By day more casual and by night more trendy the use of industrial light bulbs plus spotlights and mirrors allows the room to be as intimate or as bright as necessary and with an open kitchen during both lunch and dinner service there is plenty to watch  With a lively bar close set tables lacquered in black and brick walls plus a lively soundtrack I will say the space gets loud but certainly not overly so and for those who enjoy watching a kitchen at work the marble chef's counter is a great place to eat The Service:  Considering how busy noca was (not an empty seat in the house save for the one to my left) I was stunned at the fluidity and efficiency of service  Dishes were presented with ample descriptions questions of ingredients and preparations were answered thoroughly and knowledgably and aside from a few small quirks (that the average diner would have never paid a second thought to) my primary server named Jenny could not have been more pleasant professional or helpful with her suggestions  A lively spot where many patrons probably don't really pay attention to the quality of the service I'll simply say I've been to a number of Michelin starred spots with a far less impressive front of houseThe Food:  A sandwich and dessert at Nocawich at lunch/two drinks eight courses bread amuses mignardises at dinnerCroque Madame with Pork Belly Brioche Fried Egg Gruyere Foam:  This $10 sandwich from the Saturday Noca(wich) menu would feature a slightly modernist update on the French classic and as much as I love the combination of ham egg and cheese in all forms this one raised the bar a bit by utilizing tender belly bacon from Mr Wexler's supplier out of Iowa paired with crisp brioche a perfect sunny side egg a thin slice of aged gruyere and finally an aromatic foam from an ISI Whip that made cheese whiz seem tame in comparison  As good as the lobtah roll sounded I find it hard to believe it would have trumped the croque - but I'm certainly going back with my BOGO from dinner to find outRed Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting:  Simple dense moist and featuring an ample amount of tangy cream cheese icing there really isn't much else to say about this cake  Not overly sweet like so many 'designer' cupcakes the $350 rustic wedge was a welcome change from the norm - the cocoa allowed to shine rather than taking a back seat to the sugarDinner service will be an addendum.
This place is a hidden gem  You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close  Did I say LIVE music yes I did We went there on a Saturday night I guess the weekend it opened It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club which by the way if you have not tried must go The place is small but they had a full bar nice décor and great service  So it won me over  Must try the Texas Frito Nachos  so good  the hush puppies lack flavor but I'm not a fan of hush puppies in general My companions liked them then again if you're drunk anything fried is good  They have a small dance floor in front of the stage so bring your cowboy boots and start two-steppin  The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air  I'd go back to enjoy the live music drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price.
This place kicks ass  I'm a huge fan of non-hippie vegetarian food  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time  With the advances we made in soy products it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredientsSo I ordered the buffalo chicken po-boy  SOOO good  Plus it came with fries  Can't hate fries  It's really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant  I literally can't wait to go back  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go  It's so good.
Love this little park for hikes and walks It's quiet well kept and beautiful For the most part the hikes are all easy without much elevation gain Tons of cactus and open views creating a nice calm If you live in the area I highly recommend this park for hikes If you don't live in the area there are probably closer hikes to you with free admission (this park is $6) and it may not be totally worth the drive.
Great place to see a game  Glad I am a season ticket holder and looking forward to next season.
The Cilantro Jalapeño hummus = heaven in my mouth No seriously- the hummus and the grilled chicken on top is so tasty and surprisingly healthy I was definitely a lil brought back that Pita Jungle came to the food court of the mall but I can say it hasn't lessened the taste or value of the food at all just made it that more convenient to pick up some of their amazing food Anything I've had off the menu ranging from their salads (both leaf and fruit) the hummus and the pita plates it's all great food.
Wow Just happened to be on the East side and googled best breakfast on East side This place came up and after looking at the menu decided to try it out We are so happy we did BEST breakfast we have ever had And we've been to many of "the best of" breakfast places Such creative ingredients not the same old boring breakfast items that you see everyplace else Our breakfast took awhile to come out but we didn't care we were enjoying a delicious Bloody Mary Our waitress was awesome and apologized several times for the wait and upon paying the bill she gave us a complimentary muffin their signature bran muffin We split it for breakfast the next day and it was wonderful Can't wait to go back here LOVE.
Great  workout clothes for almost EVERY size I'm a bigger sized woman and they had my size I'm not shy about asking for the extra large as it is obvious so I was happy I could wear many many things here If you are 18/20 or 22/24 you can fit in to many things here So no worries Otherwise a majority of the clothes are made for a slimmer frameThe work out clothes have the 'wicking' fabric but in many styles and all are made with comfort in mind I am wearing some now lol  Great for running yoga etc  The woman who helped me at first was SO over the top it was ridiculous but she was very nice The young woman who cashed me out was just a lovely sweet personThey were very helpful and I was very very pleased with my purchasesThe sale items were great and a really good deal  TLDR: The store to go to for comfort quality workout clothes Over average price but not when you when you total the comfort style and quality of the product These clothes will last  There are great sales All the clothes feel like the person making them knew what a woman's wants and the shape of a woman.
the best clean sushi fresh all the food is out of this world different desserts vegetables fruit  it is amazing  the place is clean.
I've been in Arizona since 1984 and have never found a cheesesteak or hoagie as authentic as Philly's famous  I'm here at least once a month Megan and her family always make me feel welcomed and truly appreciate their customers Went to a new place in mesa today and it was supposedly authentic and I was not impressed  Didn't even have sweet peppers I'll keep making the drive to get a real cheesesteak or hoagie.
Came here for lunch on a weekday  No karaoke was going on so there was NO REASON to come here  The service was absolutely terrible  We spent over 90 minutes most of it waiting for service the bill and for the waitress to pick up the bill  I gave up on using a credit card and used cash instead so we could get out of there  I had a bowl of chili my wife had a salad and Mom had soup and a wrap  Although the food was not terrible it was nothing special and combined with the lousy service we were very disappointed  UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO KARAOKE AT NIGHT DO NOT EAT HERE.
Absolutely incredible experience My boyfriend took me here for my 20th birthday and got me the 'Romance Package' We got our own private little booth with curtains a bouquet of roses and what seemed to be our own personal server She was probably helping other tables as well but she made us seem like we were the only ones in the place The food was not only amazing it was an extraordinarily fun experience We cooked it to our own tastes and there was so much extra to choose from The portions are perfect for two and we could barely walk out of the restaurant afterwards because of all the different courses I will definitely be visiting The Melting Pot as often as I can Although a bit pricy the ambience food and experience is completely worth it.
Don't order the turkey burger  Mine was smaller than advertised machine processed rather than hand formed and tasteless.
I used to go to nation wide This place is much better Very friendly staff and great building First class.
Duck and Decanter is more than just a sandwich shop for meAs a young girl I would frequently come to D&D with my dad We would always get sandwiches and I would be allowed to get a prize from the toy chest (not sure if they have it anymore) It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond which was rare because as an  OB/GYN my dad was frequently on call and at work I was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel warm ambiance and quality of their food This June I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch The sandwiches were as good as I remember Nothing extravagant or peculiar just classic sandwiches Fresh breads crispy lettuce vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic The staff is nice helpful and super friendly They give the place a warm feel to it While you're there make sure to shop around a bit as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces chocolates and jams All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well To eat you can either go upstairs to their loft area sit on their tucked away yet lively patio or in the lobby area of the restaurant All places are nice clean and family friendly Duck and Decanter is truly a great place to get a great quality sandwich and spend some quality time with the family.
I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towneUnfortunately they had sold out of the oysters but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish then softshell crab roll rainbow roll and the green mussels The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery "rub" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled and the food came out a dish at a time giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish At other sushi joints I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater) This was a happy medium for me The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to meMy only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the barbut that's what you get in Scottsdale.
Amazing food and service  Went here with some of my guy friends and got our food fairly fast  I ordered the burger and loved it amazing chabatta like bread and unique but satisfying taste.
These guys great at customer service and first impressions These guys have excitement when they talk to the customer and act like they enjoy their career.
Amazing chicken parm I was told by my Brother i need to try it I was hesitant at first because its a Japanese rest It is fantastic I have ordered it 2-3 times a week for past month I am as picky as they get with Italian food Good Italian food Was born and raised in NYC and found this to be some of the best chicken parm in AZ Portion is filling especially for $12.
Love Jacqueline Hanna Photography We've used her for our baby's milestone photo shoots (two thus far) and have enjoyed every session  Very easy to work with offers wonderful suggestions but is never pushy about anything  We've really enjoyed working with her and our little one loves her too.
Beautiful dresses and wonderful service  They treat each bride as special and really take their time with you and you don't feel rushed  They do have some expensive dresses but they offer some amazing deals too  For a wonderful shopping experience I would definitely make an appointment with them.
My first time here for lunch I went with 2 other friends What we had:Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips Lunch: fish and chips and their special of the day meatballsWe got our appetizer and it was good The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries The meatballs that's another story They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise) There were 4 meatballs for $795 I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged I could not handle the licorice taste I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it "to go" as we were running out of time When the check came they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it Come to find out that the OWNER said "JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT" I WAS SHOCKED  I told her then I didn't want the fish and chips I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill  We ended up leaving paying $46 $800 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVEDI WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN.
This is one of the best Borders locations I've been to It is located in Biltmore Fashion Park facing Camelback The store is two stories and has a huge selection of books magazines DVD's and other things I have yet to find a Borders in NE Ohio that compares to this Seattle's Best Coffee serves great latte's and snacks It may be soulless but it's a great store nonetheless Overall if you need a book or want to spend some time in a Phoenix area bookstore head over to Biltmore Fashion Park and stop in at Borders.
Literally the most delicious food ever & the comforting cottage style ambiance tops it off I definitely suggest trying the bree appetizer & the Cobb salad is a perfect choice for any hungry tummy.
I LOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVEEEEEE Frances There is no better place to find unique gifts for others or for that most special person yourself They have such a wide range of beautiful things here (some of my favs include: Kamibashi stationary and stickers (oh so many cool stickers) jewelery by local artists unique baby and kid stuff yummy smelling lotions Anthropologie-esque dresses) and hello vintage clothes yay How cool is that Having 2 kids it is nearly impossible for me to really shop in here for very long I am considering hiring a babysitter just to go in here for 2 hours and pour over everything I heart Frances forever and always PLEASE shop here and support a wonderful local business I can't wait for that light rail to be up so I can ride it to FrancesEdit: I forgot to say that Frances is also a great place to go for a gift for the man in your life (well maybe not if the man in your life is your dad) but for virtually any other man in your life go to Frances they have great guy clothes and manly toiletries.
I can't get enough of tea ask anyoneiced being my favorite and chamomile at night   You can't go wrong here there are so many different kinds of teas that everyone will be pleased  Try the mango hibiscus and chamomile blendsyou will be glad you did.
In a word pathetic I can only comment on the brunch they presented on Sunday  Took a relative visiting from New England that wanted to eat at a Beau MacMilan restaurant and boy was it disappointing Here's the low lights:1 Menu You can pay a lot of money for the brunch or a lot more money on top of brunch to have an entre No option available just to order an entre Already strange 2 Selection Seems like whatever was left in the kitchen over the weekend turns into brunch Maybe Kitchen Confidential  was right Rice and miso soup in the left corner with a small bowl of hummus (no pita) in the right corner Omelettes on the west side Greek orzo on the east side  If you are suffering from an identity crisis you may as well serve up some classics (roast beef or ham with eggs) and take the hit that you are boring 3 Service Abysmal Our smarmy French server Daniel had an excuse for everything that he failed to deliver After 10 minutes of waiting for soy sauce for the white rice I walked into the kitchen myself and within 20 seconds came back with soy sauce Just a thought but when you take a plate with utensils it would be wise to replace them  I can steal them from the next table over myself (which is what he did) Unlimited sparkling wine comes with the buffet if you could get a refill Eventually we tasked one of   the more helpful bussing staff to fill in where the server failed which was at nearly every task and its a buffet  4 Management At one time the  manager made a stroll through the dining hall but never stopped at a single table to ask how things are going  Probably because he already knew His major accomplishment was getting more Coronas from downstairs 5 Bill Kids under 7 eat free until the bill shows up Now I've got to go track down the non existent server to dispute the billIn the end someone spent millions of dollars to build a beautiful restaurant on the side of Camelback Mountain only to fill it with unqualified staff to create sour memories for eager out of towers but at least it's expensive Highlights the table bussing staff and valet Both very nice and hard working.
Been going here for 7 years and LOVE it I wish Dr Kotian could be my primary care She's awesome.
The Boulders is the premiere resort in the Scottsdale area  The Latilla Room offers wonderful food with human sized portions - a rarity in Cowboy land  Also the wine list is extraordinary & offers good value.
Where to start  I love this place  Every instructor I've had is fantastic they are all encouraging and patient  I feel like my form is corrected 15 times during some classes but it's always in a positive way   They somehow are VERY good at remembering names it's impressive  The fellow classmates are always friendly it really is just a great environment for self-improvement  Although I dare anyone to attend a few classes and NOT be tempted to go hit up Lululemon (or anything similar) for new gearThe studio itself is great  It's clean and open and inviting  There is an area for personal stuff in the back no locker room but a bathroom if you have to make a quick change after work before class  Most importantly the workout  It is tough  After my first class I was sore for a good four days but of course it's nice to know that your muscles exist  :)  Some days I feel like I'm a machine but Pure Barre always finds a way to bring me back to reality  My legs shake like I'm standing on a fault line and I'm pretty sure some day I will fall over I guess that's what the barre is for  Anyway I've been coming fairly consistently for almost two months and I have seen tremendous changes in myself  Every day after Pure Barre feels like a skinny day  My arm muscles and collarbone are starting to poke out I've lost inches in my waist and arms it's great to see actual progress  And since the class is just 55 minutes and is very fast-paced it's pretty easy to carve out time during the day to come to class  I certainly don't experience the same level of dread as I do with the "regular" gymIt is expensive but since I've been going there have been deals and promotions to ease up on price  At this point I'd rather pay for Pure Barre than continue to carry a gym membership to a place that I don't really like going   If you're on the fence give it a shot  It'll win you over.
Just had a wonderful lunch at The Herb Box in DC RanchThe atmosphere is hip trendy and casual They had a great looking patio that I'm looking forward to sitting in when it gets a bit cooler They did have misters out there though so it's tolerable with the heat   The service was great no complaints at all I had the Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap  Wow it was super yummy   The wrap had bacon bits and cashews in it  They served the wrap with sweet potato chips  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but these chips I loved  We couldn't stop there HAD to have a dessert  We debated over everything they had and decided on the Lemon Meringue Pie it was very good and is the perfect size to share  Price was good  I split the bill with another and total came to $25.
we had a fantastic meal here with great service food and ambiance  we will be back.
This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver It comes with bits of egg and onion warm rye bread and bagel chips Our waiter Jeff was friendly and attentive even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb Our mains were baby back ribs the specialty of the house cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin The fries were piping hot as they should be And the portions are beyond generousWe topped it off with key lime pie light and tasty an ideal complement to the meaty mains And the bill was under $60 an amazing deal As a bonus some of the players drop in during spring training.
Stingray has THE BEST sushi happy hour Delicious Vegas and Dragon rolls for $5 each Sit at the sushi bar the sushi chefs are super nice and you get complimentary miso soup and edemame.
Love their Bobby sandwich Have to stop here everytime we visit So yummy.
There's a lot of Mexican options in Mesa but this one is one of the best I've found I used to go to Tia Rosa's but more often these days we hit up Senor Taco The portions are huge and value priced and they have a great salsa bar I usually get the Special #2 which is a stuffed carne asada burrito with 3 rolled tacos covered in guacamole and a soda all for under $10 I leave stuffed or with a to-go box (usually the former) You might not think much of it as you drive past the strip mall it is a part of but take the detour and enjoy the big meal  There is limited indoor seating and although there is a large patio I wouldn't want to sit outdoors in the summer.
this review is for the Blonde bartender: Dont plan on her remembering who you are even if you come in frequently my main gripe is: Happy hour actually starts 5-10 minutes PAST 4pm and Ends a good 10 minutes BEFORE 7pm I know this cuz Blonde charged full draft price on my first drink when I sat down at 3:59 (seriously thats what my cell phone time said) Also another visit I show up at 6:50 still get charged full priceso lets review a few minutes of difference and you end up spending about $9-15 more depending on how many pints you orderI mean that could have been decent tip money for her I'll continue to go however if she keeps pulling this shit I'll just stop tipping her completely.
Best Pasty in AZ  I love the vegetarian Mexican  It can get pretty packed during lunch may want to call ahead if your in a hurry.
Love the decor Love the food Love the ownersYes it is on the pricey side but a) you are in scottsdale and b) you get what you pay for - the food is high quality The freshest mozzarella is used in their salads pizza etc and the desserts are outstanding (the tirimisu and macaroons specifically)Love it I'll be back often.
Great food great service only downside is a long wait sometimes but the food is worth the wait For a small mom and pop place the cooks  and the waitresses sure keep things moving so when you drive by and you see a line outside do not worry they have free coffee and that makes the wait not to unberable.
While the weather has been so agreeable lately so has my appetite to crawl over to DC Ranch and sit on the outside patio of Armitage This place has become our backyard getaway - where everyone knows you by nameand drink I have also enjoyed the REVERSE HAPPY HOUR - and later fare menu - Happy Hour is not only for the early birds anymore :)Market Street is such an enjoyable area at night with the twinkling lights spotted about.
It's true After several failed attempts to eat at Butterfield's due to the long wait time I can finally say that I've finally had the chance to actually eat here So what did I think It was most definitely worth the wait There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends It's because this isn't your average breakfast They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu No they have succulent skillets filled with cheese hashbrowns eggs and toppings galore They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes They have bacon Belgian waffles They have oven baked pancakes The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day During my first official visit here I ate my heart out I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites) Chorizo sausage red jalapeño pepper onion & cheddar cheese All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns As if that's not enough the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast There was no way I could finish the meal but every bite I took was better then the next The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow they know how to make a carbtastic pancake I wish I could have consumed every last bite but I ate until I was full and left happily fullI'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's Now that I know how delicious the food is the wait time won't seem so bad anymore.
Delicious food large portions- reasonably priced Our waitress Debbie was outstanding Super friendly and gave us great recommendations  We will be back.
They now offer more things for me to try since my last visit  The hot salsa tasted like can  I could taste can  it was canned smooth tomato product that was slightly spiked with something spicy  I tried the pico and I am not sure if the chopped tomatoes were frozen because they looked like frozen and thawed  The tomatoes were also unripe and the seasoning was unpleasant to me  I will not fault them for the margarita since I didn't expect the best but the margarita tasted like dry mix As I mentioned in my last Yelp I didn't care for the seasoning of the chicken I had last time but I thought it was just me  I was afraid to order chicken again so I ordered a chili relleno  I took one bite and I didn't spit it out but I couldn't take a second bite either   I only tasted pan oil  My husband tried it and he said it was awful and he felt bad  and said to try his food  I tried a piece of beef from his platter and it was just dry and tasted like it was just plain dry beef just soaked in jalapeño brine  Maybe they are better at times and I was just unlucky with my visits I think it was one of the owners that asked me how everything was  I didn't have the balls to tell her  Would you.
This Costco location is unreal They had three people working the customer service counter and no one said boo to me for twenty minutes even though I was standing at an open register Then "Pete" comes up to say that he'll help the next return and that I'm in the wrong line for membership needs -- none of their lines are labeled and I was standing in the same line that people stand in at every other Costco for temporary cardsTwenty minutes later I was standing in line to cancel my executive membership These people killed my desire to make costco a regular shopping destination.
Atmosphere is great great location amazing food too My chicken was awesome but the best part we're the donuts for dessert This place serves food really late too.
The croissant breakfast is hands down my favorite Great coffee and service Love this place My wife's favorite is the chorizo burrito.
they suck.
Brackin's is exactly what Scottsdale so sorely needs  A nice friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $1000 (way less) that is unpretentious warm and inviting  You don't even need fake boobies or cougar attire to get in although I doubt you would be turned away  I came with my husband for the first time for a Yelp event organized by Donald S  Our own Michael C was not behind the bar that night but enjoyed the evening with all us Yelpers and made sure Brackin's knew to expect us  This place is small  But with the two patios we were set  The owner Doug treated us like family  Our server Renee ran her little butt off and we were never without a drink in hand  And the best part clean bathroom.
The grounds are gorgeous Interior and decor are rustic chic I am in love with this place I will be back for sure :).
Went to Postino last night with a large group of friends They accommodated us in a special spot that was both intimate and allowed 15 of us to sit comfortably Had the brie prosciutto and fig jam sandwich OMG so awesome Such a good simple but amazing panini Would recommend this wine bar You definitely get what you pay for Some might think the price is too expensive but trust me you'll love everything you have here.
I couldn't agree less with the first review  I have been a member of a Fill-A-Seat as well as a member of HouseSeats  In the 9 months I have been a member of Fill-A-Seat I have received twelve tickets to some amazing performances in theater symphony and vocal groups  There have been a lot of other offerings that were of interest to me but I have an extremely full schedule  The customer service is wonderful unlike my other subscription  It is very important to check in often and remember that summer is the slow season in Phoenix  At times there have been up to 10 different events offered  Yes there are comedy clubs offered but lots of other stuff too  My other subscription usually says nothing available  So be flexible be adventurous try something new and enjoy Fill-A-Seat.
Did not enjoy any aspect of this restaurant Had the shrimp po boy Bland and boring My husband had another sandwich the Vesuvius Also not good Service was slow although the server was nice Oh and no one greeted or seated us Not a big deal but when we decided to seat ourselves no one showed up for at least 5 minutes  Okay drink specials was the only real up side Zero value in the food though.
What a great Greek food place  My girlfriend and I ordered falafel and a side salad plus got a drink for about $8 each  Honestly this place is SO good When you walk in you might think it wouldn't be that good but it made me feel even better  The falafel was great was moist and had a great flavor to it  The pita it was warped in had to be made by this place  It was fluffy and had a great crisp to it  All of the fixing that went into it were extremely fresh and I truly enjoyed it  Then came the salad which I decided over the fries I have never had a salad with so much feta I had to pull some off  Good thing I like feta on my falafel as well so I didn't waste itI will definitely come back to this place to try something else for a cheap meal Way worth it.
I know it must be hard to be a coffee company competing in the world with Starbucks and I get the hook this place is trying to pull off BUT here's the deal you can't be hipster and elitist and the same time  I tried to order a vanilla latte and I thought that the woman behind the counter was going to stroke out right in front of me  "We really don't recommend you put flavoring in our coffee" Well I really don't recommend you scold customers when they try to pay for your product I will drink my coffee however I like it  I don't need a undereducated 30 year old barista to tell me how I should drink my lattes  Sooo if you like over priced coffee BLACK and black only then go on down to Cartel but if you ask for sugar be ready for a berating - don't worry that part is fee they don't charge extra for it.
I love Japan Express for the large #1 teriyaki chicken on brown rice I shake on the toasted sesame seeds some siracha and some chili seasoning There is a pitcher if purified water to that is always nice too Police and Fire eat there often.
We had the house pizza well done minus the green peppers It was awesome The beer list was great but the best part of the dinner was the bartender Danielle was so nice to us and was really fun to talk with She made the experience truly memorable We'll come back not just for the pizza but to hang with Daniel again too.
Suki suki nowwww Time for some PhoCan you say delicious in Vietnamese  WHO CARES  This place has got the best soup in town and unlike its neighbor LoLo's Chicken and Waffles this is healthy stuff  I have ordered the Chicken Broccoli and Bok Choy Pho twice now and have no complaints  They bring out all the fixins too Bean sprouts basil leaves cilantro and lime mmm  Rice noodles chicken broccoli and Bok Choy are simmered in a mouthwatering broth sprinkled with herbs to boot  If you haven't gone yet you better put that fried chicken down and check yourself.
Three words: bacon infused meatloaf I could end my review right now and that would be all you'd need to know to make your decision I am shocked this place has a 35 star average because my experience here was nothing short of 5 stars The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends The open kitchen allows the guest to see the chef create the masterpiece and the staff is extremely friendly every step of the way But the food is really what makes this place a 5 star in my book I don't often eat meatloaf but when I do I want it to be sublime This was more then sublime it was heaven with every bite I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite I also liked the fact that I could order a half order and trust me the half order is still extremely large The burger here is also spectacular as well as the Mo' Rockin Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce dough balls This restaurant is a hidden gem and one I wish I made my way to more often PS - for all you locals out there the vibe of Cookin' Jacks still lingers and in a good way It brings back memories.
No more traditional movie going or me This place is really cool If you have limited date time (like you are paying a babysitter) have dinner and a movie all at onceI had the coconut chicken strips and fries and they were good Don't order the cheese and cracker plate it's gross but DO order the popcornOh and being able to press a button and have someone bring you alcohol during a movie Hello.
Love this place Authentic Japanese food and other items They are a small shop but have a nice selection and some other ethnic foods as well (Hawaiian Chinese etc) The staff is always courteous friendly and willing to help They won't try and sell you anything Every time I ask for assistance they always steer me to the most economical products that will accomplish my goals A few days ago I went in pick up some sake for cooking The older lady (perhaps an owner) asked me if I liked the brand of sake I had chosen I told her that I had never tried it but it was for cooking She recommended that I purchase a much cheaper smaller bottle if I was cooking with it only and showed me her recommendation ($249) I appreciate their honesty and integrity.
The wings are absolutely amazing They made me feel like carnivore Yum Tacos are also very good People are nice and friendly Service is on point So far I'm in love.
I LOVE THIS PLACE I have been going here for years and the atmosphere is amazing and still not as great as the super fresh food It's gotten a little crazy since the Food Network show (I was there the day after not realizing and the line was INSANE) but it doesn't dissuade me Especially when you can take a walk down the path after and burn off a few calories and scope out the farm itself.
I live close enough to Joe's to be tortured daily by the enticing aroma the smoker emits My family can pick up dinner here for less than we can at Micky D's (If we don't order drinks) so we often opt for BBQ if we are going to eat out The food is amazing the staff is always friendly and the location can't be beat I can't wait to try Liberty Market and the Farm Grill.
All I can say is "Wow"I tried these guys because they had a booth set up at Denim and Diamonds  Oh myI am so glad I tried the brisket sandwich  It was warm drippy barbecued delightfulness  I highly recommend a trip to this eatery  You will not be let down  I would drive from Tempe Chandler or even Scottsdale for another sandwich.
Chef Gerald comes up with some of the most fantastic tasting desserts to suit all palettes    Everything from custom gourmet chocolates to fine pastries Old-World style desserts and more     My personal favorite is the poppyseed cake he makes absolutely fantastic but there is a great deal else that is exceptional and I'm trying out as much as I canas my waistline allowsthis is a really great bakery that definitely deserves a visit.
I love the view food and service here I love dinner and brunch at El Chorro I just adore everything about this restaurant (No the sticky buns are not a draw for me :) I personally think they are weird with wine and dinner-I guess I am not a sticky buns kind of girl) Love the patioThis is one of my favorite places in the valley.
After reading the other reviews I'm pretty much just seconding most of them  It really is like a Mediterranean Chipotle:  Pick your size pick your rice pick your veggies pick your meat pick more veggies pick your hummus pick your sauce  It's awesome very delicious everything fresh  Price is "fair"  Not expensive not cheap  Just fair  My meal with a drink is like $10The owner/manager was also incredibly helpful in recommendations descriptions etc  Great guyEven had a couple of kids playing sax/guitar a few times if that's your thing.
A) The place was so dimly lit I couldn't even see to the other side of the restaurant B) They skimped on the Italian vinaigrette on the salad but I feel like they were doing me a favor because what I did have on my salad wasn't very tasty The bread was okay but nothing to write home about The oil used for dipping the bread into tasted like the stuff you get in gallon jugs at Costco/Sam's ClubC) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right I don't trust you to do anything else right either) The meatballs weren't bad but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store My father and I both agreed that it tasted nearly-identical to the Michelina's frozen spaghetti dinners you spend less than $1 for at the grocery store Summary: I won't be going back on my own accord.
The hangover sandwich here actually works I swear whenever I am having a rough Sat morning I crave that sandwich and if I get it ahhh I think I am cured :).
Gotta love the Sno BallsI have never been to New Orleans during the warm months - all my trips have been late October - early January - so I have never tried a Sno Ball in it's natural habitatThat saidI have a bunch of NOLA friends - and they all assure me this is the real deal While I have to take their word on the authenticity for now - my own taste buds tell me this is GREATSure - most of the flavors and the concept is similar to a snow cone But the ice is shaved so much finer - it's an amazing texture - not at all grainy  Really like the Rocky Mountain snow I grew up with in northern New MexicoOver 50 flavors to choose from - check out the website or better yet - go in and get one (or 5)Great for kids 2-92.
I live right around the corner from this Fry's but much rather drive to the one on Baseline and 24th St The cashier here are anything BUT helpful and the lines are ALWAYS ridiculously long This store should just be shut down or some major customer service needs to be taught The store looks trashy and small Certainly does not have the look of a proper Fry's.
So why did it take me so long to visit this resort around the corner from me  Talk about romantic and beautiful grounds  The bar spills out onto a gorgeous courtyard complete with awesome mountain views and fabby fountain  Fantastic service very ZEN and prompt bartending  Their cocktails are mostly all unique and fun  Great wines by the glass & YUMMY appies  They have an amazing Happy Hour - i am sooo going back asap.
Oh God this place was awful This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration) This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense North Dakotans) I really have nothing good to say about this place This place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl) the beef in there was extremely toughOur server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough The portions started off small but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for moreIf you want decent korean food drive a few miles south to Hodori.
I'm a sucker for Chicago food from back home but out here in the valley and Higley Hot Dog has been there for a while providing authentic Vienna Beef Hot Dogs since I went to ASU east campusVery home town feel the older couple that owns/runs it are always very nice and happy and having a good time  And the lunch line there gets long and out the door cause it's so good :)Notes:  Not open on Sundays and CASH onlyThe MAP on yelp is/was wrong here's the correct business profile link on Google Maps - http://isgd/fn6UThey have some good press already as well:http://wwweastvalleytribunecom/story/123004http://wwwinsiderpagescom/b/3657327340.
I organized a corporate dinner event for 50 employees I had not been to Richardson's before but had heard great reviews and was excited to host our event at this special space I walked into the restaurant and was greeted with rude service from the start A waitress actually yelled out behind me "MOVE" It appears that the staff was overwhelmed and acted as though they did not know the specifics of our reservation which we had gone over with the events person in detail weeks prior After speaking with the manager the service did improve and I have to say the food was fantastic It is a beautiful special space and they serve amazing food but the service was not good.
This place was awesome the base for the soup were awesome We got the combination and of hot and regular The hot was a little too hot for me but  I guess I could have asked for it mild to begin with The meat was soooo good the shrimp puffs were amazing We could not go wrong with the veggies and the mushrooms The green tea cheesecake was very good too The service was very attentive I feel sad that the place was not busy but I kind of understand it with the weather being so hot hot soup is not what one craves but once we were inside the place is cool and the food which is the most important thing was excellent.
Love this place  It's definitely not fine dining  it's just a mom 'n pop that serves great food  Best part of the decor is the framed pictures of scenes in Greece  But the food  Fresh great quality ingredients great sized portions reasonable prices  I'm originally from Chicago and I think the owners are too  going to George's reminds me of being back home  Great gyros served with a yummy and substantial Greek salad is my fave.
I absolutely love Ace stores  It's a clean store they are very friendly helpful and usually have what I need  The one time they didn't they researched it (rare item didn't even find one for sale on the internet) and got back to me in a timely manner  They weren't able to find the item but they found a much more affordable alternative  :-)  That's worth 5 stars in my book.
I came there with a coupon Withing 5 seconds I was upsold for something $5 more expensive My fault but it was just the beginning The nice young man went on to ask me three time if I wanted detailing I said I didn't  Then we waisted another 3 minutes talking about the services I didn't need  When I finally got to the register and after my bill was brought on later the charge for detailing was there Again they judged me right $ 20 is not a big deal I didn't go back to argue I am now on my third hour of waiting The room is full of people in the same situation  The Guy next to me is joking  we must be getting our money worth for it to take so long It looks like they talked or tricked a lot of people into buying the service knowing they do not have enough people to handle it.
Anytime I am in the area I stop here for a boba tea  Love the atmosphere and the drinks I highly recommend this place.
Woo Hoo another fantastic downtown dining spot I have always loved Fate (Johnny Chu's other downtown joint) but Sens rocks it hard brilliant food and superb drinksThe food is referred to as Asian Tapas exactly what it is Small portions ridiculously big on flavorThe Miso soup was the best I have ever experienced Chock full o' mushrooms and other delightsthe salad special of banana sprouts and other items I can't quite recall Perhaps the flavor euphoria has drained some of my memoryI'm not big on long-winded reviews so try it then sit back and listen to your inner contented self you will say yum too.
Outstanding cheesesteaks  Nothing but good experiences here  While you may spend more than you planned for lunch the portions are quite large  Always a good choice.
This is literally the best taco truck I've ever had I came to visit a friend in Phoenix and we went here after a night of fun at Charlie's Not only is the food amazing and full of flavor but it's beyond reasonable Tacos are only a $100 and oI don't remember anything being over $700 It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix I tried the carne asada tacos super nachos with asada mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada If you love authentic Mexican food you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis.
This place rocks   To be able to kick my feet up drink my wine have a blanket handy and watch a movie was a great experience  I only tried the dessert so maybe next time I'll try some of the pizzas.
I love La Bocca's Bruschetta so much La Bocca is definitely one of my favorite places in Tempe to go Their sangrias are great I've had the white and the red and they both are very flavorful without being too much Most of all however I have to talk about the bruschetta because that's what I get every time I go I always get the same thing - one caprese one pesto tomato and two prosciutto goat cheese fig They are all fab but really I could probably get four prosciutto goat cheese fig ones because those are the best Absolutely delicious I've also had their limoncello which is pretty tasty I go to La Bocca all of the time and it's definitely my favorite spot on Mill Ave.
i always forget about this place when we do a party they carry costumes and party gear year roundeven halloween stuff stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks we bought on-line for 30 bucks i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party bike pub ride or just feel like dressing up this place is perfect.
Whenever I am craving a Runza (a favorite food from my hometown of  Lincoln NE) this place takes care of it They have a wide variety of fillings anywhere from lamb to a wonderful vegetarian selection  I've been to both locations and they have always been very consistentFYI Runzas are also known as Bierocks of German origin  (savory filling of meat onion and cabbage).
I used to go to this restaurant with a friend many years ago  I always loved their food  Tonight I was in the neighborhood and decided to give them a try to see if my memories were justified  They were  Though it was a quiet night the food was excellent  I was treated as an old friend and felt very comfortable  The ambiance is great  They have a small dining room with all sizes of tables  The tabletops are of brushed aluminum and are gorgeous  There is original art displayed on the walls all modern  Some of it is for sale  Upon entry there is a very nice divider that separates the dining room from view of the door  I ordered Sing Chow Rice Noodles and they were deliciousThis place is a little hard to find but don't hesitate to stop in for either lunch or dinner  You'll be glad you did.
Horrible service no smile no hi no thank you If you want peoples business you should act like it.
Love the fast service when too lazy to cook The food is great.
I love Rosita's The food is awesome and the happy hour is fantastic I go at least once a week I highly recommend the spinach enchiladas and the shredded beef tacos.
You can get a 3-ounce taster of any of the beers on tap for $1 or $2 each I went with a group of friends and we tried ALL THE BEERS It is a night that will live on in the annals of history I highly recommend it as an adventure a group bonding activity and an opportunity to discover new beers you likeThe food is mighty tasty I've had sweet potato fries at a lot of places and these are hands-down the best They're a little on the salty side but that's how I like them If only they offered them with Delux's aioli then we'd be in business We also got a meat & cheese plate and the grilled chicken flatbread pizza They were both quite tasty and disappeared quicklyOur server was great We were a big group and it would be easy to mess up with all of those tasters But he got everything right and checked in with us regularly It also didn't hurt that he was a cutey patooteyThe only con was that we were seated in an alcove with two booths and it got really loud with all the sound bouncing around I wish they'd put up a curtain between the booths and something on the walls to dampen the sound For now I'll just ask for a different table.
The negative complaints about this place are all about the prices here The food is awesome Fried pickles are some of the best I've ever had Support your local restaurants and pay the extra buck or two It's going to be better than chilli's I promise.
I have been getting my gas here for years  I can't remember the last time the kiosks on island accepted cash  You have to go inside to pay cash and back inside to get your change waiting in line each time  So much for convenience  I'll go out of my way from now on to get gas elsewhere.
I'm not a member of a gym but I wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of BS paperwork I'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around waste my very precious time talking about things I already know and try to persuade me to join their gym That's not what I wanted I already had my decision made that if I saw the equipment I wanted to use that I would go ahead & join I just wanted to run in & out quickly while I had a free minute to do so and check it out Oh well I figure I just saved myself some time and money with this place I used to be with LA Fitness They are wonderful I think I may check out the Gilbert Rec Center & see what they have I'm sure they won't mind me taking a look If not I'll head back to LA which I highly recommend.
Tonight was our second time at this Chompie's and had I written this review after our first visit I would have given it 4 stars  However after the service we received tonight we will not back  After reading other reviews one can only assume that the Borenstein's have made so much money that they could care less about what kind of service their patrons get  We arrived around 5:00pm and the restaurant was not very crowded yet  My husband order a soup and sandwich and I ordered the Jewish sliders  Long story short  every table around us received their food even though they arrived after us  It took so long that the couple next to us commented on how long our food was taking (at this point they were almost done with their meal)  Not being able to locate our server I went up to the hostess and asked if someone could find out where our food was  In less than a minute the manager (Phil) magically plots the food on the table and says "the sliders just take a really long time"  No apology nothing  Without  going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and Phil suffice it to say that Phil had real attitude for manager  At no time did he offer an apology free dessert or to take anything off the bill  He practically blamed us for being too impatientTo make matters worse right after Phil left the table our server Justin decide to continue with the attitude  He asked us how everything was and my husband replied that "he didn't know yet because we just got our food"  Justin didn't seem to understand why my husband was so upset and my husband explain about the wait for the food  Justin's reply  "Well you have your food now  what's the problem"I left out lot's of detail but you get the picture they could give a crap about service  I don't care how good the food is but rude service with attitude especially from management is never acceptable  We will not be back.
I Think this place is AMAZING They have a really nice selection of Mid Century Modern furniture and the owner was really nice  There were lots of nifty pieces and I really like the vintage retro airport sofa seat I will be back for sure.
I've been using Magic Pest since I moved into my home 15 years ago   The people they send to spray are considerate and efficient  The treatments are effective and priced right  I'm glad I found them and would definitely recommend using them.
This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix I've never had better pho than here I usually order the "spicy beef sate" pho which is miles above the rare beef pho My family and I also order the pork "spicy treats" which is a roll-your-own spring roll It's delicious and fun One order feeds all five of us The owner is also extremely nice They also offer discounts to ASU students Have to love that.
This was an amazing night It was a romantic birthday dinner for 2 (entirely planned by my hubby)  The staff greeted me with a signed birthday card they listened to my husband's request for a table with a heater on one side and not on the other (he gets way too hot too fast)  The service was top notch and the food was a bit of heavenIf you go try the Parmesan Fries with the Truffle Aioli with your dinner Any other french fry will suck in comparisonI can't wait to go back They do brunch.
Nobu's food doesn't challenge you it thrills you You already know about the accolades and awards that extend far beyond this valley So let's get down to the do's and dont'sDo:  - sit at the counter at least half the time  - beg for oxtail stew get on the "oxtail stew call list" if they run out find and kill an ox chop off his butt  - say yes to the little live flash-fried river crabs  - try the omakase menu at least once  - order a bottle of the Jozen Mizu No Gotoshi sake it's floral and dry and perfect (we mow through 2 or 3 but we're drunks)  - order the white fish carpaccio garlic has waited 1000s of years for this dish to be created  - be nice to Chantal she is a cool chick  - marvel at how skinny Jeff the Chef is  - work harder to make more money to come back to sea sawDon't:  - come here for sushi rolls  - tell your party that it's "right up there with Stingray"  - bring someone who wants sake bombers  - bring a large group it's optimized for couples and small groups  - be allergic to anything cuz god knows what's in there  - look at the prices ever when the check comes cover the top with your other hand and just sign tell chantal to add the tip in  - be afraid to ask the chefs what they're doing and why learnRarely is innovative food so comforting We always leave happy and less wealthy If a place can consistently do that for you and keep you coming back it's onto something.
This spa is amazing The staff was very friendly and the services I received were outstanding  You can add on services to your treatments that are all great such as a hair dew treatment hot salt back scrub aroma therapy and many more There signature massage is a Blissage75 (a 75 min mass for $150) and their facial would be a Triple oxygen facial which is also 75 min long  All the technicians are trained well and are very professional   In the lounges you have fairytale brownies crackers cheeses cucumbers lemon/cucumber water  You will be very satisfied with your services at this spa.
Coldwell Banker has been instrumental in our transition from Mesa AZ to Sturgeon Bay WI Our Coldwell Banker Marc Maryland in Mesa referred us to Doris Bodener in Sturgeon Bay to help us purchase our new house She has our best interests at heart After several showings and some of repeat showings we finally found our home Thank you Coldwell Banker for an outstanding job.
A friend and I decided to try Wallys because they were having a prime rib special The internet and menu stated the special was available after 4PM We arrived at 4:15 The waiter said that it would be an hour before the prime rib was ready We asked to speak with the owner He came over and we explained that we came beause of the special and it would not be ready for another hour He started screaming at us and told us to leave He said 4PM was a typo on the internet and also on his menu He told us to leave his restaurant and never come back We were so scared that he would get violent He definately has a mental condition.
Loved everything about this placeread my tips.
Service great French toast sooooo yummy Bacon perfectly cooked how I requested and the bacon is not wimpy Home fries are seasoned with garlic - SCORE I really enjoyed this place The chair was uncomfortable - that would be my only complaint.
I took the pole dance aerobics class last night and man am i feeling it today everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me as ive never tried this kind of thing before it's tucked away and at first i had no clue where it was but its worth the search had a blast got a great work out and felt great afterwards im definitely going back for more.
I had a terrible experience at this shop-The owner is rude- my work was not done on time- I was yelled at and accused of having an expensive handbag- she ordered me to pay in advance- I think she is a nut- she did not call me to tel lme my dress would not be ready- it wa a special occasion stay away.
Love hummus falafel gyros and the like Come here You can taste the freshness Pita Jungle is good but this is much much better Come here to get your Greek food fix especially if you live/work nearby in Scottsdale Ranch or by the hospital Despite being hidden in strip mall by Quizno's Starbucks and Chipotle it is a real gem Good service too Support small business in Scottsdale.
More than a restaurant Cafe Monarch is a Phoenix must-do-before-you-die As every review proclaims Chris is a culinary maven who makes every experience unique and custom to the preferences and tastes of his clienteleThis is by no means a large restaurant the dining room fits maybe 5-7 small tables with views of the chef at work constructing off the cuff dishes And while the idea is that you sit close together with other people--this is a neighborhood restaurant after all you don't feel crammed among strangersDefinitely make reservations for dinner and be sure to tell Chris about any dietary restrictions We stopped in for brunch yesterday at 11:30 but were easily enticed by the lunch menu displayed on the daily chalk board Gruyere and cheddar grilled cheese with spicy chipotle tomato soup was the perfect meal for a wintery afternoon Still hungry Sure Chris whipped up a chicken dish lightly seasoned with chopped eggplant and sweet black rice which was enough for 2 but technically was for us to "split" only charging us for 3 plates total A choice of iced tea or Cafe du Monde coffee was offered and we chose the iced tea infused with hibiscus and other fruity flavors perfectly flavored yet unsweetened Dinner runs about $50 a plate and bunch/lunch $20 Cash ONLY and BYOB ($10 corkage fee) Perfect for out of town guests special occasions or if just you're craving delectable food Even though it's becoming well-known it feels like a secret place you discover every time you go.
From what I can tell I don't think Dick's wants your business With no sign out front and as hard as it is to find you have to be in the know to give the aptly titled Hideaway a try  But search for it you must for it is truly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had the pleasure of consuming I'm a huge fan of Mexican style breakfasts and the Huevos Rancheros are insane Two eggs any style served on a blue corn tortilla smothered with green or red chile and cheese served with potatoes and beans and it is enough for two people  Just look at the pictures posted by the other Yelpers people  You can tell just by looking at the photos that this place is going to be awesome  Just go in and give this place a try already (if you can find it)  How many more five star reviews do you need.
People who live in suburbs understand the necessity of having a car Because metropolitan Phoenix is a super-sized suburb all residents understand the value of having a car In fact a lot of people have to drive to park-and-rides to use what little public transit there is here Unfortunately cars take a beating go through wear and tear break down and in sum can just be a real headache One night I noticed my car needed well over a hundred feet to brake The Car Shop fixed my car and said I had one broken brake line and the other was swollen They were fast professional and the staff was quite likable It was a very reasonable price to fix both brake lines and they did a little extra work on it at no charge Next time (and there will be a next time) my car has problems I'm taking it here.
I have been coming to Olive & Ivy for almost two years now I bring family and friends here from out of town The food is consistently fantastic and you can't beat that free bread with the pesto I took my mom brother grandma and 2yr old daughter yesterday for lunch We started with the Tuna Tar Tar Tacos My mother and brother LOVED them My daughter ate at least two big pieces of bread and tore up the pesto How many 2yr olds are eating pesto really The general consensus was that they loved the food and wished I would've brought them when they first got into town I ordered my favorite chicken panini w/fries It's just too good to get anything else Don't get me wrong I still take a taste of everyone else's food so I know what to recommend to my future guests That panini with the cheese zucchini roasted tomatoes roasted chickenmmmmmmmmmso good They also have great fries sorry to say but second to Gordon Biersch Brewery'sOlive & Ivy never lets me down Great location great seating whether inside or outside Can't wait to go back.
Veg comfort foodSWEET  My husband and I are doing this detox thing with no gluten too and they had tons of things on the menu we could have ordered  He was laughing at me (I've been a back and forth vegetarian/pescatarian for 5 years - always one or the other) as I went through the menu online going "oooh  oh my godoooh"  It is a rare treat for me to find a place where I can eat EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu without any modifications needing to be madeWe got carryout and it was certainly a bit of a drive from Central Phoenix (2nd location please  :)) but it was totally worth it  I can't wait to try nearly everything on the menuIs it greasy  Probably  Is it health food  No  Is it awesome  You bet  PS I got the Mongolian Rice Noodle Bowl with Mock Chicken and he got the Drunken Chicken w/Rice Noodles.
I've been meaning to write a review for Econo Lube for awhile now This is the place we go to service both our cars and we wouldn't go anywhere else These are the type of mechanics that you want They are always honest helpful and friendly They have a bunch of thank you notes up in their waiting room and I believe every single one of them We have been very lucky to find this place.
Their pizza is consistently unique and very good  Their staff is rarely ever anything but attentive and nice  Big props to Nicole who was awesome as a server today.
Wow Very delicious sandwiches My husband and I agreed their sandwiches are the best we've had in Phoenix so far They are not typical subs at all They are made with very fresh meat cheese and veggies and really mouthwatering Especially I liked the delicious cheese We had a prosciutto sandwich ($899) and black forest sandwich($699) I also loved the honey mustard sauce in my black forest sandwich After eating sandwiches we decided to have some desserts I was totally overwhelmed by the selection of nice looking cakes They had coconut cream mousse chocolate pistachio mousse caramel apple mousse chocolate cup mousse cream horns tiramisu napoleon cannoli etc etc don't they all sound yummy  I finally decided to try something new to me I forgot the name but it's a kind of pudding with fruits and two kinds of creams in rum syrup The lady working there told me it's popular in Vulcan countries My husband had cherry chocolate mousse We were both satisfied with our choices And they are $295 and $395 which I think quite reasonable It's a small place with 5 tables or so and I think family-owned People working there are nice and friendly Thier food is mostly Italian/French style with some East European tasteNext time I want to try their bread or croissantI wish this place was located closer to our home but probably worth driving all the way to get there.
First class experience all the wayI decided to treat myself to a staycation for my birthday this year and when I was looking at rates and locations I decided to go with The Boulders I made my reservation and the personal concierge Carol was in touch a few weeks before my stay just to check if there was anything she could take care of before I arrived which I really appreciated We checked in Saturday afternoon which was quick and easy Carol recognized me as I was checking in and the experience was pleasant Our casita wasn't too far from the lounge but we used the golf carts the majority of the time we were there - the drivers were all super friendly The room - gorgeous Nice little kitchenette wonderful seating area with the worlds most comfortable leather chairs huge comfy bed and giant bathroom and closet area After getting settled in we headed off to the main pool for a little bit and had a drink while we were there Afterwards we headed off-site for dinner returned to check out Sunset Pointe and then retired to our room for the night While we were there Carol must have took notice that I was visiting for my birthday and sent over a bottle of wine and a chocolate/fruit dessert - 5 stars for Carol Before we left for breakfast we checked out the spa and the pool near the front We learned that we could have used the sauna steam room and jet spa while we were there - a note to remember for next time The pool by the spa looked to be more "chill" and they have an organic garden where it appears you can pick fresh herbs and veggies I had a fantastic time It's far enough from the city and the surroundings are so beautiful you forget that you're still just a few miles outside of Scottsdale The staff was great the grounds were beautiful and I'll definitely be back in the future.
Very nice restaurantGood food and good service The kebab was wonderfulThank you guys.
I was so excited when I was their store sign go up I usually get my flavored oils and vinegars while driving thru Cottonwood once a year I'm so glad i can now purchase them locally I love that you can taste the flavors before purchasing The owners local Laveen residents are friendly and love talking about how to cook with the oils/vinegars I have purchased four flavors and use them for making salad dressing for dipping bread and as extra flavoring for grilling veggies I also bought a dessert vinegar that I like to pour over fruit Yum I saw the owners at a local event Second Friday Laveen Art Walk and they mention that they now offer  their space for events and small parties Great for a girls night out wedding shower etc You can byob  You got to check them out.
The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be  If you want up to date paper & quality productgo to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls.
The farmer salad the bread and then the pizza Who says you can't get great pizza outside of NY Great meal Worth a drive.
Aww sh*t food poisoning.
Bosa you've been dethroned I don't know what miraculous alternate dimension Golden Donuts warped out of and frankly I don't care What I do care about is a quality donut and on that Golden totally delivers Perfect old fashioneds French crullers without that all-too-common weird grittiness Amazingly light perfectly glazed raised donuts Cinnamon swirls that actually taste like--get this--cinnamonThe stamp on the box boastingly proclaims them to be "The Best Donuts in Arizona" and I can't disagree The only donut I can even begin to criticize is the long john and it's not even bad it's just that I prefer mine a little taller than Golden's flatter (but still quite delicious) version.
"When do you need the shirts by""How soon can you make 'em We got a game tonight at 9"Concerned look on Shane's face "I'm pretty sure I can do that"He did I needed five shirts for my league team with a big logo on the back and different numbers on the front I went into the shop around 4:30 PM and got a call around 8 PM saying the shirts would be ready by 8:30 I cut it close but the man delivered Shane was very friendly and helpful I got a 10% discount for ordering a "quantity"I brought the tees to my team and they all loved the shirts They dug the design the PE Shirt style material and the fit Oh and by the way we won all three games of our match that night I'll be going back to Brand X.
I wish these were on every corner like Starbucks This place pretty much takes the cake over Starbucks Their coffee isn't overwhelming and they have my favorite drink everrrrrrr  which is the Iced tropical tea latte It's absolutely delicious Yum I urge everyone to try that drink.
Can you say SPORTS MEMORABILIA But I have to say the food stands on its own I had trout my husband baby back ribs  Attentive service Festive energy Families couples golf foursomes Wander and enjoy celebrity photos autographed baseballs and bats.
FannnnnntasticFormerly Black Chile Mexican Grille Ling & Louie's Kitchen is wonderful Came here on a business holiday lunch and we simply had to sample everything We got the chicken skewers that came very well prepared with yummy dipping sauce too We also got a sushi roll which was good but nothing too exciting your basic sushi roll Also got the steak tip and blue cheese sliders and yeah they were as amazing as they sound The buns were like sweet table rolls and really melted in your mouth The extra bacon and BBQ was the perfect touch of sweet and saucy Finally we order the lettuce wraps too My boss said they were a tad satly for her but I thought the lettuce really complimented the spicey chicken and sauceFor lunch I orded the carne asada taco on flour shells Wam bam thank you maam They were fabulous The shells were so soft and chewy and tiny Freaking adorable The pico add these awesome kick that went well with the meet I wish there'd been more avadcado on each one but they were so tasty it didn't matterThe entire table truly enjoyed each other their meals and of course the staff and management were so kind and friendly to usGo here.
Lux has some of the best espresso I have ever had the opportunity to slurp  However I'm sucker for the hip atmosphere and good indie music  What I'm saying is even if the coffee was not top notch I would probably still visit  I know people make fun of hipsters who sit around on their laptops and write wrist slashing poetry but there is just something about the atmosphere here that helps me think a bit clearer  Like I said earlier this isn't just a hip place to sit  The coffee here is splendid and the froth designs on the top are always a welcome addition to my the rich coffee goodness  It is expensive so I don't go everyday like some of Lux's more affluent customers but luckily Lux sells their espresso for me to take home and brew myself  After I brew a couple shots I sit at my dining room table blast some indie music put on my black framed glasses read a Chuck Palahniuk book and think about how cool I am.
This was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through They were right on about the wait Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated (HINT HINT not a place for groups 2 is ideal 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together)Having been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ SG got standard egg plate with eggs toast ham and rosemary potatoes SG was very happy when his plate arrived The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind My oatmeal was very good but my humungous raisins put it over the top The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out SG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen) The menu is limited but offers the usuals There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special Check it out Expect a wait bring a news paper.
This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for You cannot go wrong with this place.
Sorry DOG This used to be the spot for a great Chicago dog or a slider or an Italian beef or sausage Back when Louie and Eddie a couple a wise guys from Chicago actually owned the joint The new owner is a tool It reflects in the crappy food This jag off is a whiner too I'd like to smack him in the head with the soggy ass chi dog he served up You can't skimp on the poppy bun either This stugots is screwing up a good thingLike I said before selling the recipes to a new owner isn't always going to be a good thing Here it is not RUN FORREST RUN Nothing to eat here.
I'd rather drive on a donut an extra couple miles to this store than the one a mile away from home They're more friendly and explain everything they did along with any recommendations for the future Thanks guys.
THAIFOON IS CLOSEDI heard rumors but I drove by tonight just to see for myself  Sure enough sign is down and space is completely empty  Do you think it was because of the 2 star yelp reviewsOn the other hand DISH is open  Review on that coming soon :).
Great Pulled pork sandwich was awesome.
Horrible experience yesterday  One of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant  In fact leaving this review is what urged me to finally sign up on Yelp  I work on Mill  I went there with 7 friends from work Friday for lunch  The place was only 1/3 full So really not that busy We were seated quickly but then the following series of events occurred: - 10 minutes later our waitress took our drink order-  15 minutes later food order - 40 minutes into our experience 2 of us got our food-  10 minutes later 3 more of us got our food - 10 min later  the waitress came over and asked us if we're missing anything YES 2 of us still don't have food and we've been here for an hour  The waitress asked "do you want me to go check on that"  Come on Right  No we'll just hang out for another hour and see what happens  )- 5 minutes later she brings one of my friend's dishes over he asks that it be put in a box as we have to get back to work now- 15 minutes later his boxed up food isn't there yet We have to ask 5 more minutes it comes and it's a chicken bowl he ordered beef HA- My other friend who still never got his food cancels his order- We get our check and it was incorrect We had free appetizer coupons And the 2 free appetizers were not free on our checks Waited for that to be corrected tooIt was absolutely ridiculous Thank goodness I was there with friends We were laughing at the situation the whole time If I was there by myself I probably would have shot myself in the face.
I love this place awesome food great beer/wine selection A really relaxed atmosphere Thursdays they have 75 ice scream scoops and they're kid friendly Generous pour when you order a glass of wine always a good thing in my bookJenna and Brooklyn are the only two that have served us and both and fantastic.
I do not get to go to the Herb Box often enough I love it I think it is the perfect place to meet friends as the atmosphere is laid back and cute Their lunch menu is great though I only order one thing every time the veggie and hummus wrap without cheese which is their happy something or other salad in a wrap form with hummus so surely that salad must be fantastic too I don't know how they do it but it is exceptional even with seemingly simple ingredients Their sweet potato chips are amazing and so are their crispy edamame I love their variety of iced teas and could quite likely eat there every day It is a bit pricier than my typical lunch but for Scottsdale and for the quality of food it is a great deal.
I knew I wasn't trippin' when I saw a skinny dancing banana at the house party I went to last night A because I was sober (boooo) and 2 because it was Halloween But today right in the middle of a post Halloween funk/Sunday blues combo I started to wonder if maybe I was slipped something last night when Mr Incredible who was there too greeted me at Pink Spot To protect his identity I won't say who it was but the tomato egg bacon avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me truly hit the spot and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here because that's why I'm yelping I'm going to go ahead and throw a solid five stars at these guys because they genuinely accomplished something that trumps taste price or ambiance they served up a generous helping of good humor And it wouldn't hurt to up their star count a little after that dreadful Megan D imposed her two stars Who does she think she is anyway trolling around Phoenix handing out miserable reviews Wait go back to that happy place Dugaldo Happy place Pink Spot.
These cupcakes are unbelievably good  They are $350 a piece and a little larger then average size but worth every penny  I bought 6 different kinds and every one was delicious  The cake was very moist the filling was fantastic and the frosting was heavenly  What a great treat to have such a great cupcake bakery in our neighborhood.
This place is horrible We were staying right around the corner from here and were starving after the Giants spring training game and decided to come here one of the worst decisions ever We came here at about 9:30pm on Saint Patrick's Day and all we wanted was some food We got seated right away on the upstairs patio Our waitress came over very quickly and asked what we wanted to drink we ordered 2 waters and a beer it took 20 damn minutes to get JUST our waters 10 minutes after that the SINGLE beer my dad ordered came Our waitress came back at about 10:15 (45 minutes after we sat down) to take our order I ordered Chicken Strips and my dad ordered a Caesar salad could not be an easier order right WRONG It was almost 11 o'clock before our food came My fries were cold my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate My dad's salad was just as disappointingI understand it was Saint Patrick's Day and the service might have been a little bit slower because of the crowd But my waitress did not even wait on the people in the bar nor did they serve food in the bar so the sucky-ness and slowness had nothing to do with that This place sucks A$$.
Love this place Really close to my house so I'll walk over every so often I've had the orange chicken (bit spicy for my taste but I'm weak to heat haha) the bento is great Great price for what you get Just today I had the chicken katsu and its great Will definitely keep going.
I had found fish taco shan gri la I passed by this place a few times since moving to a new office but I'm always skeptical about corporate sounding places trying to look like local food joints This place wows and is definitely a good local find I went with the fried fish taco ($299) the mixed fish and shrimp taco ($350) and a shrimp quesadilla The fish was SUPER fresh and light They serve the tacos bare and have all the fixins you could want to pimp out your taco They had 4 different salsas ranging from mild to super duper hot quite a few sauces like chipotle avocado and cilantro plus onions cilantro lime and just about anything you want All in al a great meal if you're in the mood for fish and shrimp tacos.
service is greatcomplimentary coffee and tea deliver to the roomI really like the setting of the suite and a very nice size patio facing the swimming poolit's a quiet little complex next to the Phoenician if you are looking for something a bit quiet this is the placeToo bad I came here when the weather is too cold to swimwill be back again next year.
I want to start out saying that at one time I really liked kona grill I hadn't been there for awhile and unfortunately the quality just seems to have taken a dive We had the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer The shrimp were soggy and I'd be inclined to call it candied soggy shrimp It was as though a jar of sugar had been poured over the dish The shrimp were also on crispy rice noodles that are normally edible These tasted like stale styrofoam Dish was indelible and thankfully they took it off our bill We also had the chicken lettuce wrapsextremely salty and also borderline I edible We chocked back some of the chicken since we were in a rush and were then afraid to try anything else Basically a lot of sugary and over salted processed food If I go back ill stick to the sashimi.
When one thinks of the Wild West the state of Arizona is usually close to the top of the list Playing an important part in the development of the Southwest Arizona has some wonderful places with historical significance for all you history buffsThe Vulture Gold Mine is one of these places Just outside the town of Wickenburg the Vulture Gold Mine was discovered in 1863 by Henry Wickenburg Although Henry sold the mine after a few years the mine went on to become the most productive gold strike in the history of Arizona and sparked the development of Arizona and the city of PhoenixThe fee to participate in the tour is $10 but it is a small price to pay for the sheer volume of information and artifacts that are on the property site The tours are self paced and on-your-own When you visit the tour center you receive a comprehensive overview of the mine and it's history from the current caretaker as well as a map that identifies the points of interestMost of the buildings while in various states of disrepair are still standing Many contain original furnishings machinery and reminders of everyday life such as cooking utensils cans and bottles for coffee and such One such building with a large variety of these items is the Assay Office where the gold was stored prior to shipment There are some areas of the mine that are not open to the public but since my grandfather worked at the mine the caretaker gave us full reign to wander all over the property The schoolhouse where my Uncle John attended school is still standing and contains a piano that we are certain he played as a child The swings slide and teeter-totter are still there and my mom could recall memories about those days despite the fact that she was just a toddler when they lived at the mineIf you ever have the opportunity to visit the Vulture Mine take it I am an Arizona native with family ties to the mine and I still learned a ton of information about what an important part the mine played in Arizona's historyPS - While you are there don't forget to scratch Olive the burro's ears.
Great guy prompt and excellent service great prices  I drove down from Cave Creek because of Yelp reviews I wasn't disappointed.
Stopped in for lunch one afternoon and had a tortilla crusted chicken and spinach salad HANDS DOWN the best salad I have ever had I did nothing short of lick the bowl WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFEI'll be back again and again.
In my quest for really good coffee shops I look for 5 things and each get a star if they're up to par 1 Fresh coffee 2 breakfast 3 unique atmosphere 4 comfort 5 ambient music Press has it all.
The pork meatball sandwich is the single best sandwich I have ever eaten The pho is always delicious shrimp spring rolls are refreshing and the tea is first rateI always feel appreciated when I come here and I never leave unsatisfied.
Went here last night for happy hour (M-F 5-7)  They have a bunch of alcohol specials but we stuck to wine  It was 1/2 off all their glasses  They have some decent selections with nothing to crazy or expensive  I recommend their "keg" size pours which are 9 ounces versus the regular 6  3 of those equals a bottle FYIFor food they don't really have anything special on their happy hour menu so we ordered off the regular bar menu*seared tuna = excellent*sliders = very good*sirloin Caesar  = pretty good but I think it is over priced at $15I also had like 2 bowls of those chips  OMFG they are so goodThe service was surprising fast and friendly  I'm used to happy hours where it takes forever to get food and drinks and waitstaff that are flusteredI will be back but I do think they need some better selections on their happy hour menu food wise  It also wouldn't hurt to have a normal martini or other vodka based drink on the happy hour menu.
Good authentic Vietnamese restaurant good service and great quality I'm in love with green papaya salad as long as seafood combination noodle soup yummy.
This is a great coffee house and as the central PHX area starts to gentrify this place will certainly be one of the go to spots to meet up and chill out  In the same space as the MonOrchid gallery you can't beat it for chill atmosphere  Coffee  Amazingly well-done  New drink for me: espresso-spritzeryes a fresh pour of espresso with club soda and a wee bit of agave  Jump-start and refresh all in the same glass.
A must for the sports fan  Who cares about food when there is sooooo much to see The food happens to be good so it's an added bonus  Service is fabulous - but make a reservation  Open seats in the bar are few & far betweenThank you thank you Justin Green for your awesomeness.
Great service Very welcoming and great tasting bagels.
Awesome.
Saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives We had to go The food is excellent spicy and it's awesome that the vegetarian section is just as large as the meat section Some of my favorites are the Palak Paneer( freshly chopped spinach greens (palak) cooked with home made paneer (cheese) Aloo Matar (Potatoes sautéed with green peas seasoned with house spices or the Vegetarian Thali ( 2 vegetable curries and one lentil served with rice naan yogurt and salad)You can't go wrong at this place Everything is good If you don't know what to get just take a chance and you won't be disappointed.
This my fav Place.
I agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible  We ordered fish and shrimp combo  It was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like  I had never seen shrimp so over breaded and cooked that you don't recognize it as shrimp underneathThe monster burger was ok nothing special but piled on with so many condiments (that I was not asked if i wanted) that is was dripping like liquid  And you have to pay extra for the sauces  What.
Where to start  Way overpriced for services offeredlots of waiting time for main therapist to help with stretching at end of sessionif he happened to stop by   Billing states 15 minutes of "manual therapy"in reality1 minute  LameripoffAssistants are good but this place is overcrowded over priced and not too personalized  Highly disappointed  Billing to insurance appears inflated to the point of ridiculous  Therapy exercises ( which I did) $268 ice pack $50 Ultrasound(not even close) $64 patient eval$198Will not return to this factory.
What a gemStaff was amazing and skilled in the fine art of customer service My wife and I are locals that wanted a staycation sans kids and to celebrate my wifes bday I booked on Hotelscom and called the resort to confirm Nina was awesome and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion Some reviaewers mentioned the snooty attitudes of the valet staff and tcooksstaff We had no such issues at all They were all wonderful and if you tried to tip valet they reminded you about the resort fee an no tip policy After a pleasant happy hour at t cooks with excellent service we retired to our room only to discover a clean room and chocolates for my wife We will be coming back.
I have been here twice so far both ventures for the afternoon buffet The second trip came recently to confirm the quality as I remember being blown away the first time and had another great experience I am excited to start eating here more often as it is on the way to school Until like 2:30 pm they have an all you can eat buffet for around $9 and a guy like me is fully capable of devouring 3-4 entrees in order to get full So this is the basis for my review as I may or may not make it in for dinner any time soon due to my schedule I started the game picking out a little sample of everything offered and then was planning to take it from there eliminating what I didn't like as I went up for secondsI absolutely loved it all but only went back up for a few items due to being (surprisingly) full Although I enjoyed the grilled veggies I would have to put them on the side next time as they didn't mix well with the chicken curry and masala items That was my bad though as I had chosen poorly with my plate compositionI will gradually update this review as I learn more info about the dishes I plan to start going here a lot for lunch and will be more vigilant about what is what.
Fresh and amazingly good food  It is a must stop.
Attempted to have dinner here tonight (9/9/2010) but appears they were closed  No signs confirming but 630pm on a Thursday and not open makes one think they are gone  - If I find this to be in error I will remove this review/comment  We chose to go to India Garden on Dysart instead.
This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale They have a great wait staff great food and great drinks You cant go wrong here My favorite are the Tinga Chicken Tacos and I like to wash it down with a Cadillac Margarita If I'm with my girlfriend we like to share the "Gigante" with is a 56 ounce margarita for $20 I take all my friends here who come to visit.
We have always ordered pizza from doughboys but after today we will Think twice before going back I always do carry out and today went in to pick up our order and the cashier who took my money was also taking phone orders no big deal right Well that was until he gave me my change and went and started making pizzas WITHOUT washing his hands He grabbed two hands full of cheese and put in a cup poured it on the pizza then grabbed sausage and pepperoni and spread all over the same pizza Then he came back up answered the phone and took another order touching the computer and phone then went back to making pizzas again The phone rang again and the manager on duty came up answered the phone touched the computer and he too went back to touching food without washing his hands or putting on gloves I then asked for my $$ back for my 3 pizzas and breadsticks and even after giving me my $$ he still went back to making pizzas without washing his hands Neither one even cared or said they were sorry They were very busy but that is no excuse for what I saw tonight Please take caution when thinking about getting pizza from here.
My only regret with this place is that I worked neaby for years without knowing it was there  I'm a vegetarian and I love the variety with the wraps the soup and the sides  I've tried many different wraps and each one was great.
It's different But it's good and for that reason it gets 5 stars They have great breakfast sandwiches and anything my wife had had she has raved about You can tour the place and shop as well  This would be a fun afternoon for anyone who is bored.
I don't eat meat so I probably shouldn't have gone here My husband got the "Arizona" burger and really enjoyed it I went with the vegetarian burger which is basically black beans smashed together I do like black beans but I don't like black beans with mustard pickles and onion on top of a bun I enjoyed the rosemary & olive oil fries but not enough for me to come back a second timeOur total was $1500 and that was not money well spent.
If you want an authentic and beautiful record of a moment in time Galaxie is a delightful expert at doing just that I couldn't be happierLooking at Galaxie's website I knew she was the one to document our family's evening together before we were separated by moves out of state and out of country I wanted something that felt familiar Something that showed our personalities and in a setting that was natural for usWe ended up spending the afternoon in our back yard - grilling dinner sitting by the firea super comfy setting for us Galaxie was like a member of our family And a family member with a gift for taking amazing picturesGalaxie had the finished photos ready for us on time and in a format we found easy to use We had a viewing party last night - my family is thrilled Galaxie captured the nuances in our relationships and personalities in a flattering wayI'm already thinking about the next occasion where I'll be asking Galaxie for help.
The selection and service of this store is amazing  I made two trips into the store  First to look at the appliances second to verify and order  The staff is very knowledgeable and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy  Before my purchase the installers came out to verify the opening sizes to see if modifications had to be made  Once I had selected all of my new appliances our installation was scheduled  The installers did have to modify our existing openings but they did an excellent job  Our granite had to be cut on the sides as well as the oven opening  One installer cut the other ran two vacuums to minimize the dust  Excellent job  I am very impressed with the entire experience with Best Home Appliances.
Will never go back The service was awful & the sandwiches are sloppy ugly poor quality messes Only 1 vegetarian option old/soggy toppings Told the counter girl I had not been there before  She gave no useful information Told her I am a vegetarian She made some condescending remark (possible joke but not funny) Told her TWICE what I did not want on the sandwich the cook in the window heard me & they still got it wrong DO NOT go there.
The words "trust" and "auto mechanic" rarely belong in the same sentence   Having owned many cars over the years I've experienced a very full range of mechanics  After driving by The Toy Box countless times my impression of it was that it was a boutique muscle car place  When a friend told me that he had all of his cars serviced there for years I was intrigued  I took my 2002 Tahoe in for an eval and Phil and his team were thorough and objective in their analysis and explanation  I liked that they weren't "selling" or pushy but really just matter of fact in giving me my options--- from keeping it running and stable to really fixing it up   Their rate is extremely competitive and they over-delivered on timing and service  If anything I think they need to work on their marketing as they're a real gem in a field of otherwise sketchy players.
I recently had a birthday happy hour/dinner at Nine-05 and was absolutely awed by how wonderful it was  The food was wonderful and the staff was outstanding - it was like they were hosting a birthday party for a family member  I enjoyed the different atmospheres this restaurant offers - it's perfect for both a sit-down dinner or an enjoyable night at their lively bar  I'll be a frequent visitorAnd when you go try the chai ice cream - delicious.
Horrible  False advertisement  If you have purchased a groupon or a deal for this cinema they will not honor anytging  Even if their cinema is listed as participating The manager Janet was very cold & obviously did not care.
Before I go out I always "yelp it" When I was asked to go the District I did just that and was surprised by so many good reviews Reading the few bad ones it came to me that these people are big box haters like myself So I had it in my mind this was going to be another overpriced hotel restaurant But here I am ready to tell you that the hype is true This place was really good Really We came in with out a reservation and it was busy After a short wait we sat My first impression was this was a fine dining type deal but turns out it is pretty casual Drink menu first Impressive beer list on draft all for $375 I remember reading reviews of this place being expensive Where were these people going My friend ordered a drink special (who has those) some kind of delicious infused rum elixir The sangria was pretty good too And the beer yay The menu was pretty straight forward All of it sounded pretty yummy and no words that we didn't understand We ordered some starters: Po' boy sliders baked cheese duck quesadilla and sweet potato tots Don't know which my favorite was that's how good they all were Most interesting was the quesadilla served with apple butter I had the lobster pirogi awesome My friends had the bbq'd pork salmon and blackened halibut All you heard was ooo's ah's and mmm's If you have been hearing the buzz about downtown and want to check it for yourself go to District It is easily the best I've tried I'm going back in for lunch this weekOh and free valet Thats right free.
Went to Phoenix with my baby over the weekend He asks "Baby wat u wanna eat" I thought about it and said "fried chicken boo" Baby goes to get the food When he comes back I'm looking at him like he's the LAST chicken wing on the table"WHERE DA FOOD AT" He hands me my container which I almost drop cuz I ain't expectin that much food I open and much to my delight3 juicy (NOT greasy) pieces of chicken greens mac n cheese and some good-ass corn bread Baby wasn't lyin when he said this place was GOOD He's from the South so I knew to trust his judgment =)  Can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can have some mo' of that good goodfood LoL -).
We got married here yesterday  It was beautiful and everyone loved the venue  Tasha was great to work with and there are just so many cool places to take pictures  We did a morning ceremony in late April  The only complaint I have is that where we had the ceremony (center courtyard) had only 50% shade  The groom's side was empty because everyone was huddled around the shady south side  I love living close to here so I can sneak a peek when I'm out walking the dogs.
I am SO impressed with the haircut that Danny gave my son this week Danny has such skill and expertise a true artist at his trade Absolutely the best haircut ever Easy to get there too right off the freeway directly across from Anthem Outlets Thanks Danny.
Whoa Gave this place 3 stars last time due to hiccups in service (it was their first week or so in business) But after a visit for dinner today with my family I had to update it to 5 stars The service was absolutely above and beyond Our server was quick and helpful The entire staff was so kind to my baby nephew who had a few crying bouts The staff came out with a bowl of ice cream to help calm him down and even gave him a piece of bacon on the way outAnd of course once again the food was incredible Every single person in our party ordered something unique off the menu and loved it.
I'm normally an emotional mess at airports - it's hard to leave people behind So I actually found a small spot of happiness here in Terminal 4 When walked in here I felt as if I were transported to Portland OR There was a bit of a hipster vibe from the chalkboard menu to the iPad registers to the bow-tied and thick-rimmed glasses baristas I ordered a chai tea latte and it was a well-spiced creamy drink with very large ice cubes It lifted my spirits =].
Don't go in here if your black They will be extra rude to you The wait was longer than I expected so I changed my mind Wife wanted to stay so I went back and reserved a table for 5 again She claims I said 5 She did that to be nasty And I think because we were the only black family there.
The main reason we seek out Hot Dog on a Stick is forthe lemonade  It's perfectly sweetened and refreshing on a hot day  While we tend to go for the regular lemonade we have also tried the cherry lemonade  And you know what  It's all good  I wish Hot Dog on a Stick was near where I live  When we head to the Southwest a trip to Hot Dog on a Stick is a must-do  Yes we've tried the hotdogs and liked them  However while good we don't long for them when we're home  The lemonade is another storyThe Hot Dog on a Stick in the Fiesta Mall has never disappointed us  The staff is friendly and efficient  One time I asked for a small empty cup to pour a little lemonade in it in order to take some medication that has to be added to a small amount of liquid  The staff gave me a cup without giving me a hard time or charging me any money for itIn conclusion if you haven't tried the lemonade I highly recommend that you do so.
Favorite QT Employees always greet you right as you walk in the door and they are super fast at checkout.
I worked here for about a year from 2006-2007 but I swear I'm not biasedSakana has the freshest fish and I can vouch that the chefs and supervisors take trips to California to pick it up fresh and they also get some of it from BC The service is always great as well as fast and the restaurant is clean The staff is always loud and fun and I recommend sitting at the bar and conversing with the sushi chef Masa if you get the chance He's a complete riotAlso if the 108 degree fahrenheit roll is on special order it The flavors and sauce are unbelievable I used to love it before I went fully vegetarian and still to this day that is one of the few non-veg things I crave.
Fajitas is by far the best place forfajitas  The homemade tortillas are some of the best in the City  I am not sure if any of the other mexican food is even any good here because I have been going here for years and only order the Cadillac and Chicken combo platter of fajitas  The salsa is very good if you like fresh tasting salsa that is very runny  The guac isn't always very good but the meat and toppings go well with the dish  The atmosphere is supper casual and the bar sits in the middle which isnt very large but this place gets super busy in the evening and there is alot of energy in the place  I have been going here for years and I cant think of a single time the service was not fast and great  I highly recommend trying it out if you are in the area.
If you like sports bars/ restaurants you'll love this place During spring training lots of Giants fans hang out here and the food is great There is lots of different types of draft beer and the service is excellent My wife and I went there a couple of days ago and at this time of year there isn't a lot of activity in that area of town Even at this time of year the food is great.
Been a patron at Rubio's for a long time this one included This evening had my worst experience ever They were short-staffed which created a) an inordinate wait (25 minutes for two tacos) b) rude/hurried staff c) cold food which ended up making me sick (though it could have just been the unsanitary way it appeared to be made) d) virtually empty salsa bar e) very dirty dining area/tables f) wet tray my food was set on (to his credit the shift manager had to keep running back and forth between the counter and the back throwing on the plastic gloves and making the food then running out to the counter taking the gloves off and delivering the food) and g) angry impatient customers  It was enough to seriously think about never going there again given the number of local establishments that serve just as good/better food  And now that Rubio's prices are so high I can't think of a really good reason to go back.
Lucille's has great service and great food It's pricey thought about 50$ for 2 people w/ alcoholic drinks included But I think it's deffinetly worth it Check it out.
I love this place  Went on this occassion with a gf for hh and just the best experience (not there has ever been a bad one)  The hostess sat us on the patio promptly and we were immediately greeted by our server who also happened to be VERY handsome  We had the best service all night very attentive and as good as it gets The food as always top notch  Great portion sizes and quality  We shared the mushroom ravioli prawns and cheeseburger and all were to die for I think my favorite were the prawns great size and spicy amazingness Overall doesn't get better and for the HH prices it's icing on the cake.
Service and food were both amazing My family was in town from Idaho for the holidays and I took them there since it's a local brewery My mom loved it so much she said she would be fine going there every day Possibly the best wings any of us had ever had The burgers were Delish and cooked perfectly We also enjoyed the 80's playlist of music they had on Just moved in the area and will for sure become a regular Yum.
You don't need to pay retail for that blender Or that deep fryer/pressure cooker/coffee makerI moved to PHX a couple years ago with 4 pieces of luggage on a 737 so I needed to completely stock my entire life I managed to get a lot of my kitchen stocked at Kitchen Switchin'The shelves and cabinets are full of a varied array of utensils gadgets plates vessels and cookbooks They don't stock the Wal-Mart stuff here It's usually Cuisinart or Bodum or KitchenAid The store is always clean there are not even traces of prior use on 99% of their items and the staff are really helpful when you need to find somethingSome of the knives that you'll find here are seriously high grade Japanese folded steel and Cutco brand for more than 50% off new retail prices  The only catch It's a resale shop so you'll have to take what they have on hand at the time However if you're patient the other two knives/plates in the set might be in stock next month for the same deep discount you got the others forWorth a stop any time I am driving down 7th Street.
Seriously I'm glad I don't live in Arizona or I'd weight 400 pounds I had wings here every Tuesday night for wing nightI was down in Arizona in 2008 and it was my first stopyeah you heard menot to see friends who I missedit was I'm going to Native see you there with my wings and beerseriously I think I'm drooling while writing this reviewI've never had anything else on their menu just the wingsit's all about the wings and beerlots of wings and beer WINGS AND BEEEEER and I wonder why I gained 20 pounds.
Unfortunately this establishment is the worst Panda I have been to They had only one server/cashier at 6pm for the dinner rush On top of that the guy barely spoke English and had several issues when ordering :( sad.
Good for the money but a lot of the silver tequilas were not that good Food was good but there should have been more variety Check out Dirty Tequila and Cruz Tequila for some good mixed drinks.
Having lived in Italy I normally don't go to Italian restaurants because I don't like to pay for food I can make better and cheaper at home but Miele's is the one place I will go to spend my money The food is great everything down to the bread and the pizza is killer Some people have complained about the prices well you get a lot of food and it is good food I never leave here hungry Also the email specials are a great deal If you like seafood try the seafood risotto it is a tossup between that and the stuffed eggplant as my favorite thing on the menu If you want good real Italian food this is the place if you want all you can eat overcooked pasta and salad for 7 bucks go to Olive Garden.
Great service and very good food  We had guacamole appetizer filet mignon cobb salad chicken quesadillas and crab cakes  All were delicious and reasonably priced  A great choice.
I had a fabulous experience today Chef Sara was very friendly and super helpful with the menu She did let us know she was out of some ingredients though and so the menu was rather limited This disappointed me at first so I ordered something that would have been probably my 3rd choice I got the "Rawgasmic" sandwich and let me tell you I was not disappointed in the least The bread was a amazing and the spreads were so flavorful The sandwich was topped with so many colorful fresh organic veggies too I was completely full and satisfied after eating this My friend ordered the marinara zuchinni noodle bowl and I swear she inhaled it before I could ask for a tasteI also loved the decor and even took some photos around the place to copy in my own decor Yes it is pricier than your average lunch joint but I'd rather pay extra here than at some second rate chain Here I know all the ingredients have a purpose and are all fresh organic and carefully chosen The menu is so creative and the plate ends up looking like a work of art So yeah I'll pay a couple extra dollars for that I wish I had room for dessert because the dessert tray looked incredible.
Absolutely beautiful grounds Golf course restaurants shops botanical gardens tennis courtsit's all beautiful Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is but it IS a different (and smaller) buildingOur room itself was nice but the view was what made it amazing From the balcony you can see the golf course the mountain desert views cactuseverything And the service was greatThe only complaint is that when I booked my stay I was told that each guest would be assigned an "Ambassador" who would help ensure a great stay or whatever But throughout my weekend this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up Not a big deal but if you're going to promise that service then you better deliverOtherwise great stay I would highly recommend this hotel Great for a relaxing weekend.
The Western is a fun new spot located on 5th Ave just west of Goldwater Live country bands a dance floor dim lights good food and cheap drinks made for an interesting evening I have a feeling that The Western will be with us for awhile Live music every Wednesday thru Sunday with NO COVER.
Before using Arizona Exterminating Co I used the cheap $35 service through Enterprise pest control All they did was spray for the $35 and nothing more I don't think one bug died A friend recommended Arizona Exterminating and the guy that came out came on time and asked me what the problem was He went inside and spread a can of stuff in I guess high traffic bug areas of the house then he went outside and got rid of all spider webs then spreaded a granule thing all over my yard Then he sprayed everywhere I signed up for a year contract with them and they now come every other month occasionally I see a bug inside and call the technician and he comes over the following day even if it is a month I am not supposed to have them comeI can't believe the customer service of this company and highly recommend them  I learned you go "cheap" on pest control and you don't get rid of anything.
This is by far the best sandwich place I've ever eaten at The bread is so soft and they give lots of meat I eat here three times a week I would definitely continue to come here Try the Club Grinder It's really good.
Expert service Exceptional food every time Beautiful ambiance.
Jubi  Loved the food They certainly know how to properly prepare Iranian foodWe had the most delicious:Fenesjan (pomegranate walnut stew served with rice)Khask Bademjan -  sp (fried eggplant blended into a spread served hot toped with fried onions and mint and dried whey)Yogurt Dip with cucumbers - Forgive me I forgot how to say this in farsi They cook the rice perfectly coming out how it should - not too moist not to dry lighlty scented - long grains - fluffy and zero mush consistency PerfectionThey freshly make bread everything is fresh The place is a bit old school decorated but really feels like you are walking into an elegant persian home I saw a sign for upstairs some sort of happy hour discount something but only for those sitting upstairs Worth investigating Food is not cheap but they do it right and it is delicious Also - after dinner check out the market next door It is open late and if you are lucky the owner will give you a sample of a baked sesame nut sweet bread.
I have always wanted to try Mood Swings and thanks to Yelp I did  I didn't know they provided so many services and the prices are so reasonable  I loved the mini salon services that were provided  I can't wait to book an appointment for a facial  Thanks for the amazing goodie bag.
Awesome decor great service hidden gem in Scottsdale Delicious and unique menu The lamb fondue was so great the trout salads and chicken Interesting bread basket with an assortment of muffins and breads and a diverse dessert menu They need something a bit more chocolate on it )Great place  One of the best restaurants I have been to in Scottsdale.
My friends and I went in Wingstop at two minutes to midnight thinking these people are going to hate usthey close at midnight We were surprised We offered to take order to go and they were so nice They told us to take as long as we likeso we kind of did We ordered the lemon pepper which was off the charts amazing We also ordered the hot which was good The BBQ was amazing These are the best wings in town The ranch was homemade and the fries had what tasted like sugar on them They also have pitchers of beer which is probably last thing we neededbut we had a driver The staff was so friendly They offered to package the wings we had left to go To our surprise when we got home they had given us extra dinner rolls ranch beans and potato salad This place is awesome Been to other Wingstops which are wonderfulbut the staff killed it tonightand the food rocked.
Love this place so much as they have the best Pho Bo Kho (beef stew) Always comes for more I always like to see their small water fountain that they had in the middle of the restaurant Their service is very fast and the food taste great I'm pretty sure I'll be back for more Pho Bo Kho.
Scale of 1-10 (single visit):10 Food9 Service10 Atmosphere8 ValueThis food is great (had/tried the hummus appetizer ricotta ravioli spaghetti squash casserole and flourless chocolate cake)Jannese our server was prompt knowledgeable friendly and energeticThe atmosphere is pretty damn kick ass  It's modern/contemporary but also earthy (whereas modern is usually a colder maybe steel look so it's unique)The food wasn't INexpensive but it was very well priced for being organic and what I'll call artisan food  You'll get more food for your money at Chili's but then you'll also be a fatass with factory-line food  True Food Kitchen has obviously put some TLC into their dishes and you just feel good about yourself while you're shoveling it into your faceAs an example here's my bill:$16 - 2 cocktails$14 - 2 glasses of wine$  6 - 1 appetizer$25 - 2 meals$  7 - 1 dessert= $73 before tip.
Try the specials always amazing  I really like the carne adovada but once I tried the specials I have never ordered off the menu again  These chefs really know what they are doing  And the vegetables wow  How do they make them so tasty everytime  I think kids would even like the way they prepare vegetables.
I went to this restaurant after searching for a Thai food lunch spot during a weekend of school  I went with three friendsFirst off a child about seven greeted us at the door and then went running into the back room yelling for what I suppose was "adult" in her native tongue  Second we were seated and the server came to take our drink order  My co-student said "lemonade" and she said "okay"  My other co-student said "lemonade" and the server began to talk in her native tongue as she walked awayThe food was decent however not good enough to merit me ever going back  We get to the end of our meal and ask for four checks  The woman (who speaks English) looks at me like I have just caused her three days of extra work  She says "no"  I say "we each have a card" and she said "no card for you" THEY DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT POSTED ANYWHERE ON THE WALL THE MENU OR INSIDE/OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT  Andwe don't have cash (who does)Then to top it offshe wants my credit card number to write on the check  WHAT FORI will never return and have begun boycotting at my schoollocal and has over 500 students  Nice job Washun.
I had to wait a few days to write my review of the Phoenix Art Museum because I thought I would be able to process everything I saw during a recent visit  I was wrong  I think I need to go back again and again because there is so much to take in it was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last  They have so many amazing exhibits and the 4 stories hold so many diverse pieces i was literally in awe during my tour  Shout out to Mark P and a huge thank you for walking me through your second home  I don't even know where to begin but a few of my favorite areas were the sculpture garden (it's manicured perfectly) the fashion design collection (I learned about the real meaning of 'couture') and the contemporary art collection (specifically 'Mass' made of burnt wood wire and string as well as the mirrored sound proof LED lighted room (talk about getting lost in time)  There is so much more that I'll have to go back to see more of and the exhibits are constantly changingPhoenix Art Museum also offers a ton of events and activities including films workshops demonstrations and discussions  There is also a really great area for the kids and teens as well as an Arcadia Farms on the premises  Next year they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary so I'm sure there will be plenty more unique festivities around that as well don't wait to go though go now  I had no idea what I was missing out on until I went - you should too.
Wow Thank you Yelp I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 4 years and had never tried George's until yesterday The location makes it a bit tough to recognize from the road The original gyro was fantastic Has to be the most meat I've ever had in a gyro and great flavor too So I took the to-go menu with me and saw something intersting George's Chicken Faliro Had it for lunch today :) sliced chicken breast artichoke hearts and capers sauteed in olive oil butter and a little lemon topped with a bit of feta all over pasta outstanding Great value will definitely be back.
Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini If your answer is yes don't bother coming here Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix but the Bikini is in my 'hood It's a dirty unassuming place with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini: 1 Bring cash Cards aren't accepted the atm machine is there for decoration only as it hasn't worked in at least two years 2 Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat He's my neighbor 3 Don't piss off the bartenders Tip them well treat them nicely and don't order more than three dirty martinis If you are nice to them they will be nice to you This includes but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks the price of your drinks and whether or not you get a drink at all They take no shit If you can't handle it stay away The place gets crowded enough as it is.
ProsNice buildingGood size chicken piecesGreat music playing r & bCleanLarge drink sizesWaffles were pretty goodCons A lot of staff yet one person checks on you Extra charges to meal without serves tellingEggs with cheese and onions were nothing specialGrits- needed lots of salt and butter and I never use salt Credit/debit machine down right when I need to payAsked to give cash then they asked to write my credit card number downRacist Manager/Owner and he is African AMericanAre they crazy this is still the hood.
To all the haters' "Stop Reading Now" You know who you are Pizzeria Bianco is the best pizza in town nay the countryDisagree Then explain the line of people waiting every day even in 120 degree heat I'll wait for your retort If you don't want to come good less wait for the rest of usIf you can't deal with the wait and you need to hurry up and eat so that you can scurry home to see who gets voted off American Idol then perhaps Domino's is your choiceBut I have a better plan Make an evening of it Sit with a glass of wine or beer and chat with your friends Talking can be fun too But all that drinking and chatting will never compare to the loveliness and perfection that is the pizzaAnd don't think I forgot you my precious antipasto you are my companion 'till the end.
Probably my favorite breakfast spot Depending on my mood this is how it's done eggs are either over easy or poached:Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chileHuevos Rancheros  -- red and green chileCarne Adovada  -- red only Lately it's been a lot of enchilada though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgenceBreakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.
Love this place The individual booths are creatively displayed and prices are reasonable What an interesting array of decor collectiblesetcAlso love the music and friendly staff.
Stopped here tonight and got an order of curry shrimp to go The place looks like a dive but the food is really awesome The sauce was really delicious and there was plenty of food for me to have all I could eat and share a bit with a friend I will definitely be going back to try some more items.
We took our daughter out to celebrate her 1st day of school and she wanted pizza We had heard about La Calabria and went there They do NOT serve pizza but the hostess (I think it was the owner as well) convinced her that pasta and meatballs would be just as yummy and thankfully today our 3 year old wasn't her typical stubborn self and  went for itmuch to our delight as we had been wanting to try this place THANKS GOODNESS It turned out to be an incredible find for Italian food locally owned 'mom and pop' type of place so close to our homeWe had some wine which was very good and reasonably priced They brought out some soft and fresh Italian bread with some of the most delish olive oil/seasonings dip I've ever hadThe chef (maybe the other owner) came out personally to serve our daughter her meal He offered her the parm sprinkled on her dinner after the 3rd "yes" of offering her more he asked if she just wanted the whole bowl which made her very happy Us too it was some of the best parmesean cheese I've ever tasted So fresh and tasty She loved the meatballs said they were as good as Nona's (her Italian grandma) so that says a lot right thereMy husband and I shared one of the daily specials a penne with a sausage and mushroom sauce It was a cross between a red and a white sauce sort of like a vodka sauce but not exactly I don't think they make their pasta from scratch but my oh my you couldn't cook prepared pasta any better It was done perfectly al dente and the sauce was simply INCREDIBLE if I had just one word to choose I'm sure it was more calories/fat than I would care to knowbut it was so good I didn't care It was also great that for a small fee of $5 they let us share giving us both our own salad The pasta portions were still very big we each came home with leftoversWe decided to go for it all and end the night with cappuccino and dessert The cappuccino was perfect nice and large with a wonderful foam They have 4 or 5 homemade in-house desserts but the gelato menu spoke to us We got the bananas foster gelato which was just delectable Perfect banana flavor not too powerful served a little more frozen than usual so it stayed in a wedge shape and half of it was dipped in Italian chocolate and nuts My mouth is watering just remembering it If you live in Gilbert or nearby Chandler and are looking for a family run restaurant with a casual atmosphere and wonderful food give this place a trymy guess is you'll be hooked We can't wait to go back Prices are about the same as Olive Garden or the likenot cheap but not expensivepretty much what you'd expect Oh and the kids meal was a deal at $5 with about 2 to 3 servings for the average child and comes with a 'surprise' which was ice cream and made our daughter very happy a great ending to a milestone day for herand us.
Did a fantastic job putting in new deadbolts and re-keying all the locks in my new home They even made different levels of security (house and outdoor gates) just like we requested Jeff made sure all the doors were functioning properly and he is prideful of his work What more could you ask for This a a great local company that I highly recommend.
This place has the best bratwurst I've ever eaten My husband and I tried the currywurst and the venison brat and they were both excellent The flavors are simply amazing Also I think they make their own saukraut we loved it And you must try the german potatoes The poutine was just ok but I'm picky being that I'm from Montreal Would come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale.
Best filet in Scottsdale  Best price too  Where else do you get two sides with a great steak  I always do the mash potatos and corn yum  Loaded baked potato is a meal itself too  I've had other meals there all good  Pizza is amazing love provel cheese  Also great wine list  Sit in the bar always freindly service.
This is our favorite Tempe store - We love the bakery in particular - we buy our favorite Ciabata or Wolfgang bread almost every other day The bread always tastes great and the staff are friendly and courteous I can also find organic phyllo dough and  Bulgarian yogurt here.
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back.
This store is 100% AMAZING It is clean neatly laid out lots of friendly birds and the owner and his staff are absolutely wonderfulI have a bit of a story on how I came to this placeFor Christmas my son decided he wanted a bird A cockatiel to be exact I went to another store in the valley Nice people but it didn't specialize in birds This was my first mistakeWe picked out his bird the day after Christmas and he brought him home It was not hand trained This was my second mistakeMy son worked every single day with his bird Reading to it playing his clarinet to it etc he was meticulous about the birds food/water/cage etc After a month (so just recently) the bird would get on his hand and eat out of it He was SO proudWe found his bird dead in the cage Wednesday night (this bird I was told was less than 6 months old)Needless to say he was pretty heart brokenI called Birdz and Beyond We had a long discussion about what happened the environment the bird came from and the bird was in at and how he was being cared for Some times things happen and sadly there was not much we could have done to save our little friendMy son decided he wanted to try again and Birdz and Beyond just happened to have 8 week old hand trained cockatiels in stock so off we wentThe owner was amazing he took all the time in the world helping my son pick his new friend explaining care and picking out all of the new equipment we would need (Didn't want to take chances with the old cage etc) He was able to tell him the birds birthday as well which is important to my sonThey decorated his new cage together and my son was so excited to bring his new friend homeI will go back here for supplies grooming of the bird and they also do boarding if you need to be away from your friendHe spent most of the evening last night cuddling with his little friend and making sure he was all tucked in and ready for bed I am going to be a regular at this place with absolutely no doubt I may even buy a bird for myselfIf you have any bird needs or you are looking to get a new little friend go here I cannot rave enough.
The staff is simply the best I frequent this hotel for business and recently had an odd assignment---11 straight nights where I worked a graveyard shift (7pm-7am) The challenge here is that my working/sleeping hours fell outside the normal housekeeping schedule I explained this dilemma with the hotel management and they simply said they'd take care of it They arranged to have my room serviced first thing in the morning so that it would be ready when I came back in the morning and ready to sleep And it worked out well like clockworkThe staff is accommodating and make the effort to remember guests by name What a personal touchInternet speeds are adequate HBO on tap and a decent breakfast spread Overall great value for the business traveler.
I went here with my husband on a Saturday nightwe had just walked out of The  Blue Hound Bar after receiving terrible service& this place was a breathe of fresh air- we ordered their special at the time- a vegetarian lavosh flatbread and it was A-MAZING Also had a few of their specialty drinks among which the Rhode Island Iced Tea was a standout This place has a charming atmosphere and great servicewe will definitely be returning when we are in the area.
We've been going to Dr Welch's office for 6 years now and as long we are living here we won't switch Dr Welch is really kind and caring and knows how to speak to children on their level and their office staff is really nice as well Dr Welch isn't just a nice pediatric dentist but it's very obvious that he's a great boss too He takes great care of his staff and their happiness in their workplace shows as they interact with his patients I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews on here yet You won't be disappointed in choosing this practice for your children's dentist :-).
Cowboy chow is great Been here a dozen times at least and always pleased with food and service  Order the scallops on risotto and as an entree you can't go wrong with the puerco lento fall of the bone pork served on well seasoned potatoes.
This review is for Friday nights - an event called Party Foul http://wwwmyspacecom/partyfoulazAs the website says "bloghouse/ bmore/ remixes/ hip hop/ retro/ hyphy/ straight up fuckin bangers all night"If you like that loud new school dance-punk indie-electro techno-infused music that goes beep-beep and a hyperactive slightly crazed party crowd this night is for youI invited a friend recently who asked what the crowd was like Here is the convo:Friend: "what type of crowd"Me: "Hipsters homos dance music scenesters trannies drug addicts drunk people and assorted perverts"Me: "You'll love it"Friend: "oh yes my type of peeps"If you found that amusing and intriguing as opposed to totally repulsive go You'll thank me later.
Kelly has been doing my hair for over 2 years She is an expert and so much fun to talk to It's obvious that her goal is to make her clients look and feel their best She is very detailed and she uses high-quality products to yield the best result I love the suite-style salon she works in too Kelly gives personalized individual service to all her clients If you're looking for a new salon call Kelly and make an appointment right away.
I recently had a terrible experience trying to sell clothes here I waited in the store for 20 minutes with my items (which were good brands like Splendid Lush Forever 21 etc) and they ended up taking NONE of my items Keep in mind that the store had just opened and there was no one in the store but me and two other customers To wait twenty minutes just to be rudely and quickly rejected was humiliating Also I have no idea why it took 20 minutes The young woman deciding which clothes to take kept leaving the counter for whatever reason It seemed very unprofessional to me She offered me a $5 off coupon for my troubles but that $5 is not worth 20 minutes of my time especially when I have no intention of coming back here I threw the coupon in the trash Buffalo Exchange was not exciting a few years ago and it's certainly not worth anyone's time now If you want to sell clothes take them somewhere less picky like Plato's Closet or more classy like My Sister's Closet.
Great quality meals at respectable prices and extremely fast service My wife and I go here as often as we can (we try not to eat out too much for budget reasons) and the staff are always attentive The food is high quality and tasty My personal favorite items is the Pop Eye Scrambler with Avocado: it is eggs scrambled with onionavocadobaby spinach and bacon For two adults with drinks and meals runs us on average about $26 after a 20% tip for the great staff Highly recommend this place.
Excellent Mexican food their shrimp tacos are amazing And they are open 24/7.
Very dissappointed Had the Loca la vida the salsa that came with it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted I mentioned it to the waitress and she said that others had made the same comment Well maybe you shouldn't serve it then Hello OJ was good but Expensive $295 for a lrge OJ.
I kind of wish everyone else wasn't giving it 5 stars  Now I have a 30-40 minute wait every time I go  But it is worth it  The coffee is terrific and my new favorite Banana & Nutella crepes are to die for.
not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return.
The best sandwich shop in AZ hands downIt's all in the bread Since they make their own bread on-site it makes your sandwich tasting experience so much better The aroma and that first bite into your sandwich cannot be put simply You will need to check a thesaurus to come up with better adjectives to express your experience hereThe italian focaccia and wheat bread are the best especially the focaccia I stand by the staple Dilly Club They don't short you on meatOther greats are the Blazing Buffalo Dilly Bird and the Vegetarian Special All terrific and delicious This is the kind of place that will have you coming back the same week.
This review is for the lounge that is part of this gorgeous hotel that boasts outstanding vistas along with a lush tropical feel to it  My wife wanted to check this place out for happy hour I'm glad we did The food is excellent They have $2 steak tacos on Tuesdays Although they are relatively tiny they were very tasty We had the short rib flat bread for $7 Which is not what you are thinking when you hear the word flat bread It's more like a tortilla in which you dish in the short rib meat (no bones) and lather it with this heavenly goat cheese I could have eat that cheese all night In addition we had the pretzel bread bites that came with dipping cheese The first few pretzels I dipped with the cheese but then I realized that I still had goat cheese left Think of a bagel lathered with cream cheese That's what I did with the goat cheese and pretzel bread Our total tab came to $18 (included one soda) before tipNeedless to say this place is very intimate and classy and very affordable for the regular folks  And I might add that all of the employees are professional and helpful.
Having been a long time customer of Bloom North the Green House and Sauce I have never been disappointed with any of the Fox Restaurant Concepts establishments  The quality and taste of their food is by far among the best in the Valley  That is until Saturday night  We made reservations at Olive & Ivy via OpenTablecom  We arrived promptly were seated promptly and were looking forward to a spectacular meal pared with a few bottles of wine from their typically spectacular selection  That is where our evening went horribly awry  The service was dreadful at best  We placed our order for appetizers and drinks I asked the server about a particular wine he didn't know much about it and offered to bring me a sample  20 minutes later having not seen our server or our drinks we flagged down the manager  This should've been his 1st clue that there were a number of tables in our area that were completely dissatisfied  Our drinks arrived and the server quickly left  Needless to say one drink was completely wrong and had to be sent back and my "taste" was a full glass (and I must say wasn't a "great" wine and I wouldn't have ordered it if given a choice)  We got our appetizers before getting all of our drink order and then we never saw our server again  Since we never saw our server again we decided that if we're going to drop $400 on a meal that it wouldn't be here  After flagging down somebody we asked for our check which of course was wrong  This is where the restaurant saved some face Our new server (not sure what happened to our 1st server) sincerely apologized for what had been going on and agreed to take off the "taste" that I was being charged $14 for (I only took a sip of it so the glass was still full)  When she came back she said that the manager comped the entire check since things had gone so far south on the patio  We did leave her a nice tip and I hope she got it and not the server who ruined our eveningWe decided that we needed a nice retreat from bad service so we went over to TCooks at the Royal Palms Inn (highly recommended) and we dropped $400+ there on food and wine  It's too bad with such good food and wine our topic of conversation was our earlier bad experienceI hope this isn't a cultural shift for Fox Restaurant Concepts (Bloom North the Green House Sauce and many more)  I would hate to think of Bloom treating me this way  And I just can't imagine how this could happen at this location considering the parent organization (Fox Restaurant Concepts) is located in the same building.
I love this location It's clean well organized doesn't smell weird and they have a good selection of kids toys and clothes The prices are pretty reasonable on most things and they usually are well stocked.
We were there for the official first night last night I had the bone in filletwhich was exceptionaland my husband ordered the bone in veal chop Maryland crab cake and meatballs were our appetizers  Everything was first class hot delicious perfect Our server Elizabeth was a delighton the ball and well informed by the kitchen The lavish surroundings complete the picture  Staff were friendly and knowledgable Great bar area Food cannot be too expensive when it is that good but be prepared to pay for the finest grade of aged meat and fresh fresh seafoodIf I have one small criticism it would be that the tables are too closely grouped making it difficult for the less experienced servers (water bearers) to navigate without bumping into the diners on chairs in their path Seems to be many different levels making it a visually appealing restaurant but perhaps a bit of an obstacle course.
the absloute best pizza in old town scottsdale thin crispy crust and prices are extremely reasonable funny thoughone time we ate there the door girl was falling asleep at her desk good stuff.
Had the mahi and it was great  Very reasonably priced also  Definitely a repeat.
I've had the worst food going experience at this place The food kept me up all night puking Never will I come here again From the reviews I've read it sounds like its not a very clean restaurant I'd also like to see a health inspection here.
My husband and I love to go to family owned places So we stopped in and we were greeted right away The staff is very friendly and attentive The food is great so needless to say we dine her at least once a week Food is very good nice vereity to pick from the menu and wines.
So after the assplosion I think I'd better write my reviewSucked as soon as we walked in  Party of 5  Approximately 1pm  Not busy  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty plus the sushi bar  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table  We suggested just taking a 4-top  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila  We were seated  Drink order got taken quickly  Our waitress Sarah hated us from moment one  Got our drinks placed our orders  I've never waited so long for sushiI had the tempura box lunch special and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste  One girl is allergic to gluten so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper  It came wrapped in rice  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber  Huh  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice  Luckily we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper  It was a WAY smaller serving than the originalShe was great about refilling our drinks but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever hadThis place sucks ball and I won't be backNow Back to the assplosion.
What a horrible experience Besides the food being totally awful the 'manager' on duty was rude to every employee working  The cashier (Almaz) was very nice and pleasant Immediately after I placed my order the manager yelled to her 'dont take any more orders and go take lunch' Then the phone rang and the manager answered it 'Mike i've got a line and cant talk' and promptly hung upNow they appeared to have a new employee working the other register After the rude manager gave me my order he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer I was trying to get their attention to get some ketchup and she proceeded to yell at him for pulling the fries and then told him to help me She then proceded to pull the fries out of the 'serve bin' and dump them back into the fryerOne customer (as i was walking away) made a comment to the manager "perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they'd listen better" (referring to how she was treating the  employees)It would have been nice if they provided salt/ketchup without having to ask - but the point is moot as I will NEVER go to this location again I'll eat at the pizza place next door or the Paradise bakery down the hall I have never tried them but they have to be more professional and have better foodSTAY AWAY.
Best bagels in scottsdale Excellent coffeefamily owned Great service Highly recommended.
i love this place best tom kah gai (coconut milk soup) ever EVER i have tried plenty of thai places and not a single one comes close to being as fantastic as malee's soup i moved out of state recently and every time i visit malee's is one of my first stops i will cry if they ever go out of business.
Worst Starbucks I have ever been to FLAT OUT HORRIBLE SERVICE  Took me probably  5-7 just to get a Carmel Frap One person working while the rest were standing around shooting the bullAnd on top of it all I continue to try this place out to see if maybe just one trip here will be quick NOPE The drive thru line is even worse For some reason the customers who go to this particular Starbucks feel like they are special because on top the horrible customer service I have spent countless minutes sitting behind a person who either has the mental capacity of a toddler or who doesn't understand the magical voice contraption to their left(because they take forever to order) THEN these geniuses get up the window they forget to order their favorite little side with their coffee wow SOME OF US DON'T DRIVE A PRIUS Thanks for wasting my gas and time.
This place is ok except all the old ties everywhere It's like eating dinner in a closet with 50 years worth of dirty laundry Some people like that I guess but I avoid this placeOver priced for mediocre food  Service average.
I simply love Wal-Mart and this is my local and once again in walking distance locale right near my apt I mean what more could I sayWal-mart has everything you need but what makes this one great is that they price match ANYTHINGso you don't have to run all over the valley to do your shopping Wal-mart is you one stop shop for everything from electronics to grocerieshousewares to lawn and gardenauto care to home cleaning supplies Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.
I ate at Green for the first time today I loved the Thai Peanut Salad with mock chicken My friend had the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was really good too We plan on going back weeklyI love the community table we met some nice people today also enjoying their food Someone at the table recommended the pasta with "meatballs"I will be trying that next time.
BEWARE DO NOT use your credit card here  I have had my personal & business accounts hacked now FOUR TIMES from this business  After the initial incident last year (on 2 separate cards) I was assured security precautions were implemented & systems were updated  My bank recently contacted me a week prior to receiving a letter from Restaurant Depot informing me that my credit information was AGAIN compromised and fraudulent use of my credit had been taking place for a MONTH prior to them notifying me HORRRRRIBLE  I can not respect any legitimate business who composes a letter and fails to respectfully notify 'valued' customers of KNOWN illicit activity for more than 30 days  Lesson learned this business can not be trusted.
We'd heard about this hotel for years and decided to try it on our anniversary We checked in and got ready to go out for dinner  I had decided to pay for dinner with a credit card so I consciously left my money (about $250) with an expensive money clip in the room (my mistake)  When we got back from dinner the first thing I noticed was that the beds had been turned down  We hadn't expected anyone to be in our room and my first thought was that I had left a lot of money on the desk I went to check and the money and clip was gone  I called security and they came to take my report and search the room  They said the computer indicated two employees had entered the room when we were out and that they would interview the employees  Not surprisingly the next morning they said the employees denied taking the money  The hotel didn't offer to do anything for ruining our anniversary or compensating me for the theft  A week later a manager of hotel called me at home and asked if I had found the money  I told them of course I hadn't found itone of their employees had stolen it  She then offered to send me $200 to compensate me for my loss  That was better than nothing but considering they ruined our anniversary and I lost the  money clip my wife had given me on our honeymoon 23 years ago it was small consolationOh yeah the hotel is old tired and run down  They couldn't pay me enough to go back.
i have so many friends that love lush but had never tried them went to the store and was greeted immediately and not at all pressured i got exactly what i needed+ a sample of their hydratingg shampoo bar since i had mentioned that my hair was dry i abolutely love their stuff- i've been using it for almost a week and can already see the difference.
Wow  These reviews are shocking  Maybe I just went on a bad afternoon  I'm not going to say how bad the food was but instead I'm going to try it again - just to see if its me or the foodWell the fried spinach tasted like sheets of greased toilet paper (if you can imagine that) and the mash potatoes had a stronger metalic after taste  Everything about the potatoes said "don't eat me"  The fish wasn't too bad however  The waitress stood right behind me and was bascially shouting in my ear so much so that I moved my seatBut its a real cute place and the wine was excellent.
I've been to Ocean Prime 3 or 4 times over the last year each time for larger business dinners  This time there were just three of us sitting and the bar  We had good drinks great laughs and a delicious buttery crab and spinach drink  I highly recommend the cucumber gimlet if you're gameWe decided to stay and order from the bar  While ordering I selected the bone-in filet and asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side  I wasn't 100% sure if I'd like it So I wanted to be safe not sorry  It was a $48 entreeWhen dinner was served my steak had the peppercorn sauce smothered all over it  I sent it back  Not happy about the request the bartender returned my steak to the kitchen for a redo  I would have never thought they'd bring the sane exact steak back to me sans sauceHow do I know  Size/shape/texture and my buddy ordered the same temperature as me but mine was much more re-cookedFrustrated and hungry I ate the flavor-washed steak and kept my mouth shut Last time I eat here  The end.
I've been craving this pita jungle for while and now I finally got to eat some I got a typical gyro which is not bad Healthy and enough for what you're paying for I would definitely go back for more There's still lots on menu that I gotta try Happy hour is 3:30-5:30 for $1-$3 ranges for small portion food Gotta try that too Location is pretty good and nice.
Fun place great karaoke and awesome servers Can't forget the tasty tacos.
If I have a friend visit me from Seattle(where I grew up) THIS is where I take them Anytime I meet someone new to AZ with the same taste as me in almost anything I bring them here If it were not for this place and only a small handful of others I would be embarrassed when entertaining anyone from a real city that has any culture or class Lost Leaf = 5 HUGE STARS.
It's probably not worth reviewing Changing Hands since everyone else already has but I can't help myselfAs far as the selection -- well I've seen better at other indie bookstores BUT most of those bookstores don't carry new AND USED books And that in my opinion is what makes Changing Hands rockAnd unlike a lot of other used bookstores Changing Hands actually buys books back at fair prices -- and sells their used book inventory at low prices too The last time I came here I brought three huge boxes of books I expected the workers to get really annoying with me for bringing in so much - but they were nothing but polite And even better I got a $98 store credit I was definitely not expecting thatI also love the staff's choices of books There are always some great finds in there.
Had to check out Bianco prior to moving away from Phoenix It was as good as advertised Wait time wasn't too bad Go for a few drinks at the bar next door and your time will fly by  Biancoverde Wiseguy Rosa and Margherita pizzas were shared amongst friends By unanimous decision Margherita was the top choice It was clean and balanced I would definitely order it many times overTip: Add prosciutto americano onto the Margherita pizza and feel the flavor explode in your mouth Your taste buds will thank you.
Excellent food  Best steak in town.
Wow The food is beyond perfection They really seem to understand how to begin with the best ingredients and to properly match all parts of a meal to create a masterpiece I love the salmon super food entree but the menu does seem to change so be ready to be impressed by new delicious and healthy discoveries.
If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well Always great quality and a large selection Easy ordering process and awesome customer service One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
My friend and I came to Chpotle for dinner we start ordering but I noticed that the steak was not ready so when the worker "Justin " asked me what did I want I said a burrito with chicken and steak but because the steak was going to take a few mins to be ready he gave me a cup for me to get a drink while I wait at this time my friend already had her food and drink at a table so by the time the steak was done and it was a huge burrito Justin again has to help her co worker to heat up 2 tortillas to make the burrito roll now this was nice to my surprise the cashier Taylor told me I didn't has to pay that it was taking care because I had to wait for that longI'm very happy for the caring and the 100 % customer service here I will come back again and tell everyone tooThank you JustinTaylor and Chipotle you Rule.
I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishapI ordered the red pepper tomato quiche After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold So the counter chic simply turned to me and send "well we don't have anymore of that one"Thanks I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense I'm over you being cooler than me but I'm not over you having no soul.
Not only was the food fast and delicious the service was wonderful The place was busy and still from the hostess to the gentleman bussing our table everyone had a smile on their face and was genuinely interested in our input We will definitely be back.
Simply Awesome .
We discovered this gem last spring in our travels  We hoped that it would still be here when we returned this winter  After unpacking our car we headed straight to the Lotus Garden and were elated to have our first Apache Junction meal there  We eat there at least once a week and bring all our guests there  The food is delicious and generous and is only overshadowed by the restaurant's hard-working friendly owners  We are thrilled that this place is open and apparently thriving  We wish the best to the beautiful family that has earned our business.
Can you be a member of PHX yelp having NOT reviewed Delux  This is like being jumped into Los Yelpes GigantesSince Delux has been reviewed consistently for over two years there is nothing that I can offer as a varied opinion but i thought what the hell  I don't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it  Some things are necessaryDelux is like your all-time favorite song  Sure you've had it over and over again you know its intricacies you've interpreted and digested its offerings  And then something happens that shocks you  You get sick of itSo you stash it away lose it on your memory's playback and banish it from your favorite playlistSometime later it comes up again and you think  "Oh yeahhhh"This is Delux  So you go back get your usual pint of Anchor Steam your maytag burger and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato friesThen you wonder why you ever shunned it  This shit is great  I won't ever dismiss it again  Pretty soon it will be a classic and you'll hear everyone talk stories about it how they were there in 1972 when Delux opened for The Kinks.
Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me  Hell most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home  It is so comfortable and wide open  Even on the most crowded days I feel like I am on the cast of cheers  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks they waive the pool table fee Or you could go for some ping pong foosball UFC or big buck hunting  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard If my girl would only let me I would have my wedding there.
I'm not sure why it took us so long to try this place  We used to live close to this place but didn't try it until we left  Sure this is a chain restaurant but it knocks it out of the park for meThe restaurant is very nice on the inside and the food matches  I always order the chile rellenos and they are stellar Usually we order the avocado cream dip for an "appetizer" to go with the chips that come to the table  It's probably just avocado with sour cream mixed in but it is so flipping good.
We are dismayed by your contentious and factually incorrect replyThe four women who made the complaint had initially engaged us by ohhhhing and awwwing over the service animal and pushed for us to display her to them The animal at no time 'ate off the table' or even sniffed the table If you are going to take the side of these disruptive harridans then you should be in possession of the facts So after pushing us to allow them to interact with the dog when my wife offered the animal a morsel of chicken out of her salad these people took that "gotcha' moment to run to the manager to complainThe manager as we have stated then confronted us obviously playing to the audience at the next table and proceeded to make a public spectacle of us in the restaurant When  we refused to move to the back room where he said "the people with service animals sit" we left to avoid further humiliation that had greatly upset my wife Your manager further emphasized twice his desire that we "never come into this restaurant again"His bullying tactics as well as your self serving and factually erroneous attack on us above shows your desire for retribution rather than conciliation and further solidifying our assertion of hostility discrimination and bullying at your restaurantBesides the food was uninspired and a disappointment in and of itself.
We go here every year during our annual jaunt to Glendale Glitters It's owned by a very friendly Polish family that always make me smile One year one of the daughters had a fake baby and must have been "playing mommy" for a school class It kept crying and the whole family kept taking turns rocking and feeding the baby while acting like nothing unusual was going on I told you that make me smile Every time I go there I am sure to get the pierogi as it's not to be missed But please don't go there during Glendale Glitters because it's so hard to get a table during the festivites and I really want to get a seat this time.
What a joke this place is - Ordered and paid for a battery for my quad Sept 3rd Was told would have it the 4th and they would call me No call I called on the 5th and they said would definitely have it on the 6th still no battery Called me today to tell me they might have it on the 10th When I told them to cancel order they said would need my credit card again Not a chance told them I would just charge back the cardParts manager called me acting like an arrogant douche and told me I was ignorant What a jokeDO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE THESE GUYS ARE A RIP-OFF AND TOTAL JOKE.
ZuZu has the happiest hour on earth from 5 - 7 (Monday through Friday) Sip on a hot and dirty martini for $3 with the Zombies as your soundtrack and take in the retro-sheik surroundings Then cool down with the bramble (something yum involving lemon juice blueberry and gin) The cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip are both a-m-a-z-i-n-g and will help you keep happy hour from becoming hammered hour It's a must-do for reals.
Hands down one of my favorite stores I didn't know there was one here in Phoenix This place has the same ambiance of Abercrombie and Fitch I'm not sure if they are tied into each other but it was a liilte weird The place was kept very clean and the employees were extremely nice and greeted us as we walked into the store I love that now I won't have to order my jeans online and I can actually try them on before I buy.
This was the first place my fiancee and I looked for rings The staff was very knowledgeable and educated us on the different diamond types cut and clarity They took the time to show us what they had in stock and were very friendly and professional We did pick out a diamond and a setting that day They held it for us until we made our final decision There was absolutely no pressure to buy In fact they understood that we wanted to look at other places before making that final commitment After looking at a few more places and not getting as good a service as we did at Burland we decided to go with the first one that we had picked out They made the experience of looking for the prefect ring so pleasant We were so impressed by them that we will probably be getting our wedding bands here as well.
Oh wow this place is awesome  I love everything about it  The other day after a long day at work I got there at closing time (thinking it would still be open)  I tried the door and it was locked and saw the chairs were all set up on the tables etc  I was so sad and started to walk away and a guy there came out and asked me to come in  He said they had only just closed so they were still working on putting the food away and would make me something first  It was so sweet and after a long day of work it just made my day  Their food is so yummy too and all the people that work there have always been so sweet.
The slogan for greenHUAS is "find a way to make Beauty necessary + then find a way to make Necessity beautiful"Their business card says they sell jewelry accessories art furniture and vintageI really enjoy this eclectic little store  They really do have a smattering of the wonderful things mentioned above without overdoing it  if they don't have as much merchandise as some establishments what they have is of quality    The owners couldn't be more pleasant They make you feel almost at home which is interesting as their home is in the back of the building  It's the kind of place that is worth it just to go in and find out what they have at any given time  Two weeks ago I saw a delightful yellow depression glass cup and saucer  almost the same as I remember seeing in Waco Texas when I was a teenager Don't ask me why but I couldn't stop think about it  Twice i went by there but they were gone and the lights were off   I made a special trip there tonight and again arrived after they closed  They saw me at the window smiled and opened the door so I could come in  That doesn't seem like a big thing but quite late after the hectic  First Friday crowds who would want to do that  The couldn't have been more gracious about it  and all for only for a ten dollar saleThis is a store that will be easy on the mind to just go in for a browse at the end of a long dayor any other time  Five stars for sure in my opinion.
WOW The food here is incredible I was absolutely amazed to how great the food tasted as well as how comfortable and relaxed the atmosphere was Will be going back and I definitely recommend.
I absolutely love this place The fact it's only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus It's authentic northeastern Thai food It's very good I've backpacked through the region and know the cuisine obviously not as much as someone who's lived there for years as an ex-pat or a resident but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there This place is phenomenal It's the best Thai food I've had in the valley Obviously it's not your typical Thai food restaurant due to it being NE Thai but don't let that turn you away Don't let any of the bad reviews turn you away I've been blown away by the food Their salads are all phenomenal There is one with lettuce glass noodles bean sprouts pork and shrimp (forgot the name) and that's my favorite If you're not into spicy order at a 1 or 2 spicy and they'll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself I've ordered it a 3 spicy and it's almost too much for me to handle and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy They serve a pitcher of water at every table Their larb salad is also to-die-for They serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice chicken and riceetc They're so good and a meal in and of themselves.
Well this place is a staple in my diet  while currently training for the ironman AZ it is critical to meet certain dietary restrictions   These consist of high carb high protein fiber and solid hydration  I have eaten at Saigon Nites more than 500 times and that is no exaggeration  Minh and his wife (the owners) treat you like family when you walk in  I live and die on their Chicken Pho soup and shrimp summer rolls like Eugene mentioned in the previous review  when you order the pho you can order it "ZACK STYLE" and they will know what you are talking about and probably give you a hug  Also ask to see pictures of Brandon and Brandelina two of the cutest little Vietnamese kids ever to set foot in North America :)  Back to the food for a second  The menu is very diverse offering fish chicken meat vegetarian and they can prepare it any style you wish  Light oil heavy sauce no sauce etc  Extremely accommodating  Also another disclaimer I have no vested interest in this restaurant solely a patron and advocate so they can expand their family business throughout the valley  On a off day I will order the vermicelli noodles with egg rolls and pork (not kosher) but don't tell my mom  I also ask for extra roughage  The portions are huge and you will leave more than satisfied  Back to the Pho preparation if you like hot and spicy you can doll this soup up so much you will need your own Kleenex  Their jalapenos are hotter than Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie put together  I have seen bald men cry off their foreheads into the soup  Be careful with the jalapenos sirachi sauce and there are two other red hot sauces on the table proceed with caution  I have noticed 2 maybe 3 hair grow on my chest since my ingestion with the red smooth sauce in the glass container  This is only for grown men and women alike   My last suggestion is for the lemongrass chicken extra sauce  I prefer this over noodles versus the rice and has a potent sauce that is delicious  I am salivating now writing this review  As my office is across the street many times I dine alone  Next time you stop in there for lunch have a seat at my table and order it up Zack style and guaranteed you will leave happy and "pho"  Zack.
I've used Dutch Girls off and on for years They were always great to deal with but I think they must have sold because the new counter person is not someone you'd choose to interface with the public I can't say for sure but I strongly suspect that they failed to send out a leather jacket I left for dry cleaning meaning they may have charged me for something they didn't do That would never have happened with the prior owner In the meantime the quality at the laundry at Thunderbird and 40th Street has come up substantially and they're much cheaper so I don't see a reason to go back to Dutch Girls.
Hands down our fav happy hour place$5 sake bombers $3-5 great sushi selection - what's not to love about itIf you sit at the sushi bar you get miso soup and edamame complimentaryMy husband and I go there a couple times a month and the only thing that sucks about this location - we never ever get the same server - seems like the staff turnout there is crazy Different girls every time It's not really what we want from our fav neighborhood spot Anyways the food is really-really good Try the DRAGON roll.
If I could give them a zero I would Second time my family and I go to this location and for the second time we walked out Bad service and after an hour of waiting for the food to arrive we left Never again would we go to this location and do not recommend it to anyone During our wait our drinks didn't get refilled and no apologies or explanations given for the wait.
First and foremost- thank you to my wonderful husband who gave me the world's most perfect ring I had looked for months for the perfect wedding band to match my antique reproduction engagement ring with an oval diamond (which was purchased from a nightmare of an on-line jeweler by my now husband) and was having trouble finding something that matched and that I loved In our jewelry store search we just happen to stop in at Gemsetter & Company in Chandler I had a vague idea of what I wanted and found it difficult to describe and Eric took the time to listen and even was able to do a quick drawing of a curved band that carried over some of the antique elements in my engagement ring  We were considering on purchasing a mold of the custom wedding band to have the option of a curved band on either side of my engagement ring in the future but Eric gave us a great deal (2 rings for the price of what other jewelers were quoting us for one)  He is an experienced and passionate jeweler and showed how much he cared about what he does by offering to the wax mold and cast the rings in white gold without a deposit because he was excited about the possibilities with such a unique ring set  The end result turned out better that I could have ever imagined  The rings are just beautiful and I would recommend Gemsetter & Company in Chandler to anyone.
Still one of our favorite places that we eat at a couple times a month I hope people are supporting this place as I'd hate for them to close.
Every year in the dead heat of summer I retreat to Hilton Squaw Peak and my first stop (after the lazy river of course) is Aunt Chilada's Oh the atmosphere the history of the restaurant the food and the friendly faces make me feel at home every time I am here Whether it is sitting outside at the outdoor bar or seeking refuge in the air conditioning it is simply the best part of my trip All I have to do is follow the painted chili peppers from Hilton ( I actually use them to get home if too much patron was consumed just kidding I call the Hilton to have the golf cart pick us up Duh No really that is available for hotel guests) The fish tacos are the best I have ever had and I am a snob from California  The salsa is southwest style and really good Very good beans and rice and free buffets daily at happy hour Who can complain Bands on Fridays are fun too Overall this is a gem in the desert Always featured on Fox TV  and was also spotlighted on Drinking Made Easy If you haven't been then you are missing out Live Love Eat at Aunt Chilada's.
terrible conditions in prime time of year mickey mouse layout skip it.
Love the tea here I come quite often and suggest others do the same :).
We have a Siberian Husky who must run around This is a great dog park It is a wonderful City of Phoenix service at no extra cost Parking is close There are bags and trash cans for the "doggie deposits" Luckily there are trees for shade and chairs for the doggie parents to relax in Our dog really enjoys herself here Recommend.
Just ate there Saturday night  Food is excellent  I had the lobster tacos with Mer Soliel Chardonnay  What a perfect combination  One of the people with me has the peel and eat shrimp loved it and the other person I was with love the healthy burrito  Service was awesome ambience is a bit loud.
So peaceful So quiet So in tune with natureIf you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Phoenix or perhaps even forget you're in Phoenix at all but rather in Japan next to a roaring waterfall go here Buy some fish food and feed the Koi they will thank you for it :).
I have been going to BB Hairrington's for about a year I always go to Nikki-I think she is amazing The salon is a decent size and has lots of stylists They offer you water or soda while you are getting all beautified Everyone seems to be friendly and the salon looks very cleanLike I said I use Nikki and I wouldn't consider going to anyone else If she is out of town I will wait She has really reasonable prices and I feel great everytime I leave There are plenty of places closer to my house (I live about 20 minutes away) but it's worth the drive for me Check out this place and definately ask for Nikki I get a cut with dark color and foil partial or all over foil Worth every penny and a lot cheaper than the last 4 places I've beenThey also have a gal that does nails but I think only one I haven't used her but I know she is available They offer some waxing servies also.
This place is amazingGreat concept very healthy food vibe is very cool and service was outstandingThere are few places where I want to try everything on the menu and this place is one of them I can't wait to go back PS Open a location in Miami.
Initially it was a bit scary to me but once I got used to being up in the air it was a breeze (pun not intended)  I booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasn't going to happen due to rain coming into Phoenix  Of all the times  We were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldn't so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate  They didKevin is a hoot which made for a great ride  Very professional but also fun which helped when I was still nervous  He explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over (beware the jumping cholla cactus) and even told us there was an app for wind currents (which proves there is an app for every thing) Our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise But our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people - they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them As it turned out it was just us and Kevin so it was fantastic  Seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else  If you want an experience to cross off your Bucket List or for a special occasion - I highly recommend Kevin  You will not regret it and like me will want to do it again.
I absolutely love Chompies It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really goodThey also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies red velvet cake enormous éclairs napoleons and New York style cheese cakeI'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs Food The sliders were really good unlike any slider I have ever had The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor very tasty I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitressesChompies is the best.
I LOVE this place it is so addicting It is always pretty busy and the space is small but it is sooo worth it The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo lettuce tomato their homemade salsa and onion My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta a bowl of their AMAZING pozole and a couple of Carnitas tacos Flavorful affordable delicious Enough said.
Everything about this place is wonderful I love the huge windows and outdoor patio Gorgeous Their food is amazing everything from the chips (there are about 5 different chips in the basket) and salsa to dessert They have some of the best margaritas in town Yum My favorite thing on the menu is the goat cheese stuffed chicken with roaster red pepper sauce This is to die for.
Love happy hour at Roy's It is our favorite date night spot $6 apps and signature drinks I crave the original Hawaiian martini and the spicy tuna roll Sliders with sweet potato fries are delish Have dined here for supper on our anniversary and everything was excellant The Szechaun pork ribs were amazing Surf and turf was great and the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream was so tasty They even brought out a mini desert sampler and had a special menu insert with our names on it wishing us a happy anniversary.
Usually I go to StarbucksGoing here made me kinda hate Starbucks nowThese peeps have urgency style and flair The girl who comes out to take your order is walking super fast  When we get to the window after the 4 cars in front we had literally been in line 1 minute  At Starbucks this would have easily been 8-10 minutes  The window: seriously how nice is the guy asking us what we are up to today and including us in the timing "your carmelizer is coming right up"  Once we got our drinks 20 seconds later we like kinda felt bad leaving our new best friendsThe coffee: nonfat carmelizer for me- yummyDutch latte for him: not a fanBut my hunny said he liked my drinkI still say 5 stars because of the fact these people look like they love what they do  So nice to see.
Went tonight for dinner and thought it was great  Can't wait to go back for a second try.
My girlfriend and I went to The Melting Pot this past Saturday night and the experience was HORRIBLE  It was 9:30 when we showed up and when we walked in we were greeted with a rude hostess  She did not greet us but instead asked "What can I do for you" with attitude  Well it's a restaurant so I guess I was there to get my haircut  When I responded a table for 2 she asked again with attitude if I had a reservation  The restaurant was not even half full  I said no she then asked "well are you having a full course meal" and I responded "Just dessert"  After waiting a about 3 minutes we were finally satThe horrible experience did not end there  It took TEN minutes before our waitress even came to our table  They  had a full waitstaff that just kept walking by our table staring at us  When our waitress finally did come she was also rude and offered no pleasantries  We order the Original for 2 and our drinks  Everything was then served together  I must say the chocolate fondue was delicious  However our waitress NEVER came back to check on us or refill our drinks or how our drinks and food were (For the record the Cafe Mocha was ice cold)  And with heavy food like that water is a must  When we were done she finally came over after I flagged her down then asked if we wanted refills  I said yes and the check  Once I paid she brought back my card and just left the checkbook on the table  No "Thank you have a nice evening Thank your for coming in" nothing  We were very excited about having a fantastic dessert but the rude staff there ruined the entire experience  We will not be going back to the Scottsdale location.
Update Aug 2013I made this review got a response from a manager replied to him and then nothing more I forgot about it as it didn't matter to me anymore A few months later I got a call from a woman manager who said she apologizes they didn't see that I had replied to another manager's comment to my original 1-star review She was embarrassed so much time had passed She said the actually listened realized managerial influence was light at closing and don't know things had gotten this way They actually appreciated my constructive criticism & have CHANGED things at closing That is actually what I HOPE FOR with every not-good review I leave She enticed me to come back with a thank you gift for me at the desk Already used some of it good for herRitz Carlton knows that the best way to make a customer for life is to take a bad situation and make it RIGHT makes people even more devoted than when everything goes fine Seems Changing Hands has done some loyal customer homework.
I recently got married on 05/04/2013 I had planned my wedding for a little over a year and felt very "ahead of the game" and organized I had picked out everything lined up all of the vendors and was sure that I was prepared and ready to go Then out of no where 30 days before the wedding chaos set in I realized about five weeks out that I was not where I needed to be and that with work it was extremely difficult to finish all of the final details The last thirty days truly are what make the wedding or event what they are I began research for a wedding planner My fiancé was very much against the idea He felt that all of our family members grandparents and aunts would be perfect for the task of setting up and breaking down the wedding Thank God I found Sip and Twirl I contacted Laurie explaining that I needed some serious help Who was going to handle the vendors day of who was going to set up all of our favors and goodies and decor who was going to get us in line and ready for the rehearsal who collects the gifts and sentimental artifacts at the end Within minutes of emailing Laurie I got all the reassurance I needed She responded and was so kind and very clear about how they could help me She asked me to give her all information in regards to the wedding so I slowly gathered my huge list and handed it all over to her She was so sincere professional and easy to talk with I then was introduced to Caily who became my go to girl She is AMAZING I met with her and Laurie to discuss final details and without a hitch I gave them complete control of everything That was the best moment of my entire wedding planning Caily eased all of my concerns confirmed all of my vendor information two days prior and made certain modifications of things I didn't even think of Caily is so sweet  and willing to help with anything AT ALL She truly made my day magical  All of the loose ends and details I hadn't even thought of came together like a dream and it is only because of her These ladies are beyond good at what they do they have an eye for events I truly for the first time in the planning experience had nothing to think about The rehearsal went so smooth and our families were given great instruction on where to be and when (which was SO needed) The day of I got to relax and forget about the details When I arrived at the venue I was blown away with how beautiful everything looked and how smooth everything was going We received countless praises from all of our guests about what an amazing night they had That is the best complement to any bride and groom I could ramble on for days to tell you what a duo these two are but you need to see for yourself They are affordable reliable hard working and AMAZING We have amazing memories from this day and none of it would have been possible without Laurie and Caily I am going to miss them Molly.
THE premier craft beer destination in the Valley of the Sun  If you want to try a beer you've never had I guarantee you find new and different labels at Papago    Decent pub grub and fair drink prices make this place an ultra-chill beer nirvana.
My favorite Mexican food I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too I like to wash it down with some of their horchata I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.
Well well well look who came to town We have been waiting for you ya little vixenSteak N Shake is famous for Steakburgers In sight it must be right Just a minute SNS fans this is not your typical SNS this is the adult version You are not being waited on by a server at this location This is the new Steak N Shake Signature Some of you will be sad to learn that you cannot get Chili Mac or Chili 5 ways boo hiss However with this limited menu you still get what SNS is famous for Steakburgers and the revved up gourmet versions as well The Shakes and chili are also on this menu So if you a craving a steakburger and fries and a shake come here and eat them.
It took us forever to finally get our butts in seats at MBB because frankly we aren't early risers and it gets crowded Well we should dragged our butts out of bed The food was great and well priced I have always wanted to try their waffle but also felt like having an omelet and potatoes So I had my omelet and potatoes and my fiancee got the waffle Best of both worlds The service was good the ambiance is friendly parking is easy It's a great local spot the kind that you take visitors toif you can get out of bed And you should I have other things on the menu I need to try.
So TastyReasonably priced fast vegetarianThe thyme fries are amazing.
Great food Wonderful patio And amazing company I am so glad they have only relocated because this is a treasure in a sea of junk:) The food is quite delicious and I cannot tell you how good the caprese pizza was It is more than enough to share Love love love the pesto base topped with fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes The crust was light and fresh Really enjoyed the citrus mint iced tea and to top off the meal I enjoyed the no bake chocolate and peanut butter cookies soy free of course This place is so amazing and I love the little changes they made since relocating downtown Did I tell you I had great company for lunch Thanks Michael.
What A cultural store in the state of Arizona You mean one besides the touristy Native American ones on every cornerIndeed you heard me correctly For the longest time I never even knew this store existed It is somewhat hidden located in the courtyard next to/behind Fatburger on MillI have been in there twice and I was amazed within the first 10 seconds the first time I went in This shop is very unique very interesting They have stuff from many different countries the man will tell you that when you walk in He will also give you a tour of the small store I got one both times I went it was great I remember in particular the little things carved out of nuts it's weird yet utterly amazing They have so many different things jewely purses beads rings trinkets doo-dads thingamagigs etc But seriously it's great The next thing I am going to get there is some kind of Elephant purse/handbagAbsolutely a great place to stop by if you are near Mill Ave Very interesting and an awesome place for those of us in in the Valley that actually admire Culture.
I keep coming back but havent been lately I would rather go here over any other place in the metro.
My new favorite italian spot  Loved it  Talked about it for days  We ordered a ton of food-- Calamari was awesome spinach ravioli and caesar salad were perfect  My husband had two beers a ceasar and an entree as well  Our bill was only $60-- totally worth it Service was awesome they made us feel like family.
Ice cream done my way Yes pleaseI love cookie dough but don't like Vanillaand this is the only place I can do thatThe staff is friendly the lines are never too long and I have yet to have a reason not to come backThe ONLY issue I have is I would like coupons more frequently Will not ding them a star but worthy of mentioning :).
We decided to try this place because of the good rating overall on yelp  When we went in we realized that we probably should have kept looking for another restaurant  When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve  Don't get me wrong though We usually do like Americanized Chinese food  But this place is not for us*Appetizer = mu shu pork with tortillathe mu shu looked like pile of vegetable and meat scraps*Main dishes = oilytoo sweetnot a fan*Atmosphere = full of kids.
You know what  I love Dillard's  I love this chain  I used to work for them when I first moved to Arizona actually and while I quit it almost immediately (let's face it some people just hate retail work) I've always liked their selection  Their pricing can be fair and it's just a step between Sears/JC Penney and Neiman Marcus  It's a good middle placeBut the Dillard's in Scottsdale Fashion Square is the PITS  I went here the other day on my lunch break  I was actually thinking of shelling out some serious cash just to get a pair of jeans that would last awhile and look good  I walked by not one not two not even three but SIX employees who did NOT offer to help me in any way  One even looked at me with her eyebrow raised like she thought I was going to steal something  Was it because I was in no makeup and glasses  Would I have had better customer service if I'd come in wearing my contacts makeup and a skirt  Seriously peopleI assume it's the same as when I worked there several years back--that pay is dependent on both the hourly wage and also the sales rung up  Are you honestly going to tell me that SIX employees had no interest in a woman carrying around a pair of $100 jeansI just shrugged and got a pair of Levi's instead.
Service with a SMILE Warm and inviting and the food was ok for finger foods if you're not interested in having a large meal and just want to pick  What topped the icing on the cake was that the Manager would come by your table and ask if everything was to your likingnow THAT deserves 5 stars in my book.
Sat at the bar Ordered the tostada appetizer which was delicious Also had the pork shoulder tacos that are cooked for 10 hours Very yummy The mission is very romantic with darker lighting I highly recommend it.
The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita we were left to enjoy our night of solitude The room itself was beautiful king sized bed fireplace patio overlooking the golf course vanity ipod dock jetted tub separate shower and plush robes and slippers We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic For $13 the salad was a total miss Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves tomatoes onions and cucumbers thrown on a plate I was hungry though so it workedThe next morning we slept in as late as we could I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks balsamic) so I called the front desk for some Tums No problem they arrived pronto We packed up and called for a ride and although they said they were busy they arrived shortly after I would love to come back here and stay a little longer The service was great the place was beautiful and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.
Finally La Condessas sister spot is open If you love La Condessa and are on the Westside then make sure to come in The Horchata is the best I've ever had My favorite tacos are the chicken mole tinga cochinita pibil and el gaucho They have a huge salsa bar with tons of options.
I love the pizzas here The crust is positively delicious I never get that nasty crash I do from other pizzas The Superbiotic on skinny crust is my favorite The staff here is always friendly and they have me coming back atleast 2-3 times a week I've had delivery too and they're always prompt Like they say when they answer the phone "It's a great day to get Naked".
The worst thing about this place is that it's so far from my houseDefinitely my favorite Chinese place in the valley so far  Reasonably priced friendly people excellent food with which they are very generous  The orange chicken here is very good and very orangeyIt's one of those hole in the wall places that you wander in to by chance  Really small place with only three or four tables  So good that at least three people I know started delivering for them just so they could score a free meal every now and then.
I am transplant from Chicago where we know pizza like no one else and this place has the best pizza on the entire West Coast  One bite and I knew immediately no other pie can compare 2 thumbs way up.
This place was awesome I liked choosing any plate of sushi on a whim When something delicious scrolled on by- I just grabbed it What a great idea It makes for a speedy lunch I went here with my boss because his kids love the place Well it just so happens that I love sushi too It was cool to check out a different sushi place than the usual RA or Stingray.
Oh it's so easy to love Short Leash The staff are super friendly and nice and the dogs are just fantastic This food truck (and soon to be walk-in restaurant) serves hot dogs sausages and brats from Schreiner's a local place and they are always delicious Each unique hot dog I've tried so far - the Oliver and the Aiko - are yummy and fresh The super soft naan "bun" is great compliment to the dogs Definitely worth a visit.
Amazing food and usually it's amazingly crowded to go along with it Might be better since they opened their new location on Shea Blvd  The food is really good and cheap too- it's great to go with a group of friends Share cheesy bread pizza and pizzuki (i can't spell it but its a warm chocolate chip cookie thing with ice cream).
this was my last stop on my Phoenix vinyl ventures It was actually supposed to be my 2nd stop but they close too early at 6pm so I got there too late the first time I was able to get here at 530 and felt bad since the lady stayed around till 615pm for me-----I could have spent at least another 45 mins here I didn't realize that they kept an Indie section up front so after spending most of my time finding just a few items in the regular section I found my section but right at closing time As I have pretty much most of what I want on UK vinyl I now mostly collect Japanese vinyl releases----this place had a pretty good stock of nice Japanese pressings of the stuff I like Pricing was on the higher side most of my Japanese scores were $20 and up They had some killer 7' vinyl like rare Cure singles but they were way over-pricedi ended up spending the most dough here even though my best finds were at Revolver.
Always helpful Great staff I never feel pressured to reserve things here unlike the other one on 51st and Indian School.
Coinless operating and friendly staffNew attendant Marcus was friendly and helpful.
Love what they do and stand for If you have never volunteerd you should at this place great staff as well.
Funny how a small theater that shows mostly independent films could draw such a crowdWent last Sunday to see "Milk" with Julia and Ayesha  I ran into the bartender from Harley's in line  Then saw our own Amanda with her little girl outside tooThe line was a bit long butOMG an electronic ticket machine  Went straight for it with my debit in hand got my ticket in less than 2 minutes  The staff at the concession stand was awesome  They were really funny and you could tell that they loved their jobThe theater itself was nice  Not stadium seats which all the big theaters have  We got seats close to the front because it was *that* crowded and there were 3 of us  Try finding 3 seats together on a Sunday afternoon  Seats were comfortable  Even though it's an older theater there were still slots in the armrests for your drink  This will definitely be my first choice despite it being at Fashion Square  I prefer independent films sometimes and this place was the top banana.
This is one of our absolute favorite places for Mexican food  We generally take people here from out of town as one of our "go-to" places  I can say the shrimp molcajete is one of my favorite dishes around  I've yet to see it replicated at another restaurant  It's a soupy cheesy bowl of shrimp goodness  It comes served in a hot lava bowl that is still bubbly 15 -20 minutes after it's been served  It is on the spicy side  My husband and I always share a bowl and use the last of the tortillas to sop of every last drop  Enjoy.
I love Costco I'm not even a member here and I love coming (don't worry I always come with members) It's busy on weekends (as expected) but slower on weeknights Staff are friendly food/drinks are cheap and I always spend way too much money here On a side note my boyfriend and I just bought our bedroom furniture set here and we are super impressed with the quality and price Furniture stores are charging double or even triple what we paid for and we are completely happy with our purchase I also like to browse Costco online to see what's not in store So I will happily keep returning even if it's not this exact location.
Wonderul food and staff The chicken kabob is amazing.
Stayed here with my wife when business brought me to Phoenix and had a great time Our room was a nice suite a la the Embassy Suites brand and the price was reasonable The casitas are much bigger and also a good deal price-wise We just didn't need that much space We enjoyed the lazy river the water slide the wading pool with a waterfall and the hot tub It's great in the summertime as well as the shoulder seasonsNote that this hotel is very kids-oriented At peak times there can be crowds of boisterous adolescents in the pool areas many of them with no adult supervision The hotel is also "pet friendly" a plus for some and a minus for others.
Great prices and a variety of ethnic foods.
Love this place  Friendly staff great coffee and the best pancakes in town  The Hit-the-Spot pancakes are a must try  Fun place for evening coffee and dessert too  Try later in the evening and you might get free dessert as they clean out the case for the next day.
Fish tacos 24 Hours You now know everything you need to know.
I am so impressed I thought everything out here was just strip malls and chains It made finding the place a little difficult I didn't expect one large free standing building surrounded by desert trees and picnic tablesI walked in and was even more impressed This place had options The coffee shop is simply under the same roof as an olive mill In one corner there are outstanding breakfast and sandwich options gelato and pizza in another and locally pressed olive oil sold in the centerThe coffee was great and the ambiance superb.
I just attended this family owned shop My wife and I took in our African grey named cocoa From the first step we took in  We were greated and felt very welcomed Omar was nice enough to share his passion of birds with us He helped us and educated us on our grey  We are definitely becoming regulars  because he took the time to talk to us about our bird and not try to push us to buy anything  Omar is great and birdz and beyond is a great family business.
So this review is a little late in coming - The domestic atmosphere in my life has been a bit suffocating in these last couple days - Wednesday was a particularly stifling night and for a mid-week change my boyfriend Nathan and I decided to go out to diner instead of just lounging around the house After a long debate on where to go and the realization that it was almost 9:00 and bar food would soon become our only option we stopped in the Melrose District outside a little Italian place called Harley's Even on a Wednesday they were open until 10:00 - The bar until 11:00  Huge sigh of reliefWe were greeted warmly and seated in front of these huge windows that look over Copper Star Coffee and Revolver Records (reviews to follow) Warm fresh baked bread with cracked spices in olive oil for dipping started us off We were talked in to the Mozzarella in Carrozza as an appetizer - This may very well be my boyfriends new food favorite  It's a thick slice of mozzarella sandwiched between two pieces of bread and lightly fried  that's right a kick butt fried grilled cheese  with home made marinara on top not that ghetto crap in a can style of sauce As an entre I had the Pollo Marsala and Fettuccine Alfredo by far the best I have ever had The marsala was slightly sweet served over chicken that was cooked to perfection and the alfredo was super light in taste and texture  Not to mention the fact that our service was impeccable drinks never ran dry and the bread basket was always refilledI'd like to send a special thanks to our waiter Justin - He was a riot He knew about everything on the menu made perfect diner recommendations and was able to convince me and my boyfriend of at least three different lunches diners and deserts that we plan on returning to try He's a local artist with a fantastic sense of humor and a true talent for turning a not so hot evening into a night spent in laughter over little plates of heavenIf you stop by I recommend joining the email list so you can get the weekend update on dinner and drink specials - If you manage it any leftovers will be boxed up for you labeled clearly and double wrapped in cellophane for easy spill proof transport to the fridge Prices are super reasonable too - bigger portions and better food for the same price if not less than the chain style restaurants like dare I say it Olive Garden  Also a portion of the proceeds this Thursday the 24th will be spent helping to raise money for the Food for Life charity What could be better fill your belly without empting your wallet and giving back to a good cause at the same time  Dig it.
If I could give Burger King no stars I would I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap I used to stop here on the way home from work and have a double whopper and frys I really looked forward to it but not anymore There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage I kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt It never got back to being what it used to be Its just disgusting The flavor has changed the texture has changed everything else good has changed I am done with BK for good Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food I think I will stick to Jacks from now on.
Best Mexican Fast Food in town Love the Oaxaca burrito tortillas to go (great with butter) Other recommendations are the chicken burrito (very juicy) and the machaca plate It's all good Service is fast so don't worry if there's a line when you walk in It's normal I usually order to goavoid the restrooms at all cost If you must go expect the same experience as a "Honey Bucket" (very gross) If you want to dine in go to the Shea location The food is the same but bathrooms are much cleaner.
I have driven by Sierra Bonita a million times while doing business in Central Phoneix and kept saying to myself: "Self: -gotta try it"  Now I am pretty upset with myself that it took so long Note to other reviewers: this is not a Mexican restaurant It is not fast food It's a Southwestern dinner housewarm welcoming and comfortable We are still talking about our evening and intend to take the entire family back for an event soon (cant wait) Our service was stellar and I am sorry I don't remember her name She was so friendly and had a great personalitynever acted like she was in a hurry She had great drink and Tequila suggestions The drinks were fresh and strong We ordered the red chili Mac and cheese appetizer - which was a very liberal portion for two people My husband's eyes rolled back in his head and he not only polished off every bitehis finger finished off the sauce left in the panFor my entree I ordered the stuffed Poblano - also an appetizer but it was perfect It is served in a small skillet on very flavorful retired beans and really GOOD homemade tortillasnice large and stretchyjust like Abuelita made them My husband had the red chili pork roast and loved itgreat smoky flavorWe had such a nice dinner that we stepped over to compliment the gentleman at the door who turned out to be the ownerreally a nice charming guy I love it when the owner of the place acts like he is hosting a party and having a good time himself  - and that was my impression When we told him where we live he was surprised Heck we would drive twice the distanceand we will as soon as I can.
Truly an amazing meal  Great space open kitchen is very entertaining  Sincere warm friendly service  And outstanding foodThe chicken is phenomenal - perfect example of how a humble dish can excel with great execution  Someone in your party has to order it  The lamb was similarly terrific  The braised leeks are well covered in other reviews here and are a great choice but the fennel was even better - the ratio of various ingredients perfectly balanced and with just the right amount of dressingIf you consider yourself a "foodie" - or whatever annoying term we use to describe ourselves - you owe yourself a trip to FnB  This is a restaurant that could thrive in any market in the country - Phoenicians be thankful it is in your hood.
I love this edifice so much I want to marry it But since marrying buildings has not been approved by the voters of Arizona along with same sex marriage and the marrying of goats I shall perhaps just have to have a party here WOW What a venue The ECHO magazine awards were held here and they couldn't have picked a better space The textures shapes and colors are stimulating and soothing Much like that chilled double shot of Patron they served me Great sight lines audio and comfy seats all added up to a win win situation Oh And the fact that we won that night was even better The views of Tempe Lake and the infinity pool were amazing From the outside I have to admit it looked a bit like a Evangelical church But once inside full of drag queens and Grey Goose schwilling mos I knew this was not that kind of church In fact no church at all Tempe Center for the Arts is its own art Sexy Chic And urban I think that party I'll have will be a yelp event and y'all are invited.
Great Italian Very fancy very nice very good presentation  Very intimate and cool ambiance  We really enjoyed ourselves.
Never had a bad meal in all the times I've gone there Good service Friendly place Great sushi.
We've been coming here for years - and it has always been one of our very favorite places Perfect for a special night out - either for a romantic dinner or with friends  But tonight we discovered a new thing to love here at Pappadeaux: the chargrilled salmon diablo Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it Even the broccoli was delicious Steamed with a light sprinkling of garlic lemon olive oil and a touch of warm red pepper flakes Love.
On time came out for me in August 2008 after Sonora Air ("Premier Dealer for Lennox")said it would take 3 days to fix my air handler that was under warrantyOn time HVAC came out fixed the problem right away (the same day)and charged what my service call would have been for SonoranEveryone there is friendly polite and  HONEST Totally comfortable calling them again this morning-AC is out Called at 8:30 and tech to be here between 11am-1pm I am scared to tell too many people or the service times might drop )TOTALLY 100% satisfiedUPDATE:the Tech Jeremy just left he was the same Tech last time too Fan motor was bad and because I have a Lennox not a convenient fix in Surprise as the parts dealer is in SPhoenix Jeremy assessed it very quickly left to go to part warehouse and upon return had it in and running in about 15 minutes I could have waited and got the part shipped to me for around  $275 waited for my brother to get around to it and baked my ass off but Jeremy told me it was under warranty so for $65 more that just the parts cost  he changed it out Not too bad considering I am in a time crunch Thank you On Time maybe change your name to On time -Save Time lol.
First time today  What was I thinking and why did I wait so long to head down here  Seriously $1699 (with coupon) for a hand wash of SUV glass cleaned mats cleaned vacuum and tire dressing  It was busy hot and the wait was long but totally worth it  I usually wash and detail my vehicles myself but just couldn't get to it this weekend  Anytime I can't wash my own vehicles I'm bringing them to Los Olivos  And the employees are so nicebonus.
This place is great For lunch happyHour or a late night taco Fun vibe yummy and fresh street tacos.
I hate to admit to my sweet tooth - and I do keep it under control most of the time But I did succumb today when I visited TopIt Cupcakes with my junior Yelper daughter AbbyAbby had chocolate with salty caramel icing and I had the ganache-filled chocolate cupcake  Yes you read that right - chocolate ganache filled Oh my Decadent rich over-filling Both were absolutely delightfulAfter we finished our treat I went back in and suggested that the owner participate in a Yelp event His cupcakes are better than others I've had at various events I guess I'll wait and see what happens Meanwhile when I have another sweet tooth I can't ignore I know how to fix it.
I had dinner here with my wife last night for my birthday  I can best describe our dinning experience by using the best urban adjective I can think ofour experience at Kai was RE-DONK-U-LOUS  The whole dining experience was like watching a ballet Every move our waiter (Daniel) and his assistant made was well choreographed purposeful and symbolic Each menu cover has a watercolor painting that is designed by local Pima elder Mike Medicine Horse Zillioux (he is also the flute player you will hear in the back ground while you eat) In addition each menu cover design comes with a story given by our waiter The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was very knowledgeable on the list but the sommelier self-admitted  that  the list needed some updating since some of the wines listed were not in stock However no ding here from us As the sun was sitting Daniel (our waiter) pulled back one layer of the curtains in our room which gave an effect of the wonderful colors of a setting sun in the entire dining room After the sun was half way down the Estrella Mountains did Daniel pull back the final layer of the curtains and we were in such aweFOOD:THE BEGINNING (Appetizer)We started with the Lobster Degustation This dish was made up of three lobster dishes The first was a buttered braised lobster tail under an avocado mousse tear drop salsa & lobster coral Second lobster dish was lobster knuckles in sweet corn panna cotta with sour radishes Third was a lobster cobbler with mesquite meal & burnt Irish porter cheese (this one was my personal best)THE JOURNEY (Entree):Wife had the Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage Infused Gnocchi The venison was prepared with a spiced sweet chile & fair trade coffee rub served under a broccoli rabe puree shaved pecorino & currant jam Wife describes it has tender and flavorful without any of the game taste that sometimes come with venisonI had the the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe This dish was prepared under smoked corn puree cholla buds Merquez Sausage (chorizo) and scarlet runner bean chili and Saguaro blossom syrup Again no game taste and very tender The buffalo was cooked so well that it was like cutting into some butter WOW THE AFTERLIFE (Dessert):We had the Creme Brulee Meets Old World which consisted three creme brulee dishes The first dish was an Eclair inspired creme brulee which was a mesquite meal choux & lavender custard Second was ice cream sandwich inspired It was made from two pieces of ginger snap in between a Mexican vanilla bean ice cream creme brulee The final dish was a meringue pie creme brulee that was a masa pastry tart & meyer lemon meringue Great dessert It was such a wonderful experience Every detail of our dining experience was thought out carefully From our forks and spoons being warm to the touch when our main courses came out and to them being chilled when we received our desserts.
This is my very mostest favorite Pei Wei  Food is THE BESTI don't know why but this particular location makes the BEST Pei Wei food  Perhaps it's the incredible volume of business that they turn everyday~ they've truly got the magic touchI am a regular there for lunch at least once a week  It is almost always crazy busy  They are efficient and friendlyThe food is always prepared well  You THINK a chopped chicken salad is the same here as at other Pei Wei's  NOT SO my friend   THIS one knows just how long to poach it debone and deskin it and the proper dice  It is always a sublime salad experienceWhatever your favorite PeiWei dish is it will be prepared better at this location  Parking here can be a bear but there is a lot across the street for overflow traffic- southeast corner of 7th Av and McDowellGo  But go after 1pm when I'm gone.
OHSO doesn't stand for anything in particular but who cares This place has a nice feel friendly service and a terrific brunch The food was uber-tasty but what really wowed us was the $10 price for a brunch item plus a 10 ounce beer Where else can you be fed like that Good menu choices like breakfast burritos green pork chile and a fantastic french toast with toppings Love the open garage door windows and the cool mist on the toasty Arizona patio.
OMG what a madhouse  Did the organizers REALLY not know how many people were going to show up or how many Groupon Living Social and 'free w/Spring Training' tickets were being given out  ReallyI would have given it two stars because two of the trucks we actually got food from (after waiting 15 hours each) had really really tasty food (Jamburritos and Tom's BBQ) but even both of those were out of some of the items we wanted before we got to the front of the line  (And one of those was at about 12:30pm less than 3 hours after opening with more than 3 hours to go)  As the afternoon of waiting wore on and more and more trucks ran out of food entirely that put even more pressure (and longer waits) for the ones that did still have something to sellNot only that but the mercenary beverage vendors were charging the same $4 for water as they were for a beer in the Happy Hour tent  What a jokeI am only grateful I didn't pay to get in.
In the world of cakes there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness In my world this does not compute It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty PeriodSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake but nothing more Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so If you like the taste of fondant you've got to be kidding me--YuckySo take my review or leave it I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second less of course it's for a wedding than it needs to be both EQUALLY Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake Not me So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to meNow I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting Frosting is secondary to me So if you are more for frosting than for cake ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine no really go aheadIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting then BRING IT ON I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake I won't make it a point to get an inside piece or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cakeAnyway Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me If I have to partake in one of her treats I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcakeAs for MJ Bread I have no complaints there their breads really impressed I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread but I remember being V E R Y impressed.
The Mr wanted enchiladas we were in the area I agreed to try this place out neither of us had ever beenHe proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told everything is pre-made with onionsWTF I wanted to leave but he decided to try the Fajitas I got a tostada and tortilla soup Not even picture worthy Tasted like premade crap and La Victoria canned beansSO let's just play a fun game with the name here:Sounds Like: Garcia'sBARFcia'sGROSScia'sDiarrhea'sI think you get the pictureI would not recommend going here.
This is a tiny grab and go version of the delicious locally owned Dilly's Delis around the valley  Of course it is no where near the menu of the actual restaurants they have outside of the airport but obviously that is because it is a Kiosk in an airport  The wraps are delicious and better than most of the larger restaurants in the airport by far in my opinion  If you are wanting the yummy soups in homemade bread bowls you will have to drive the 2 miles to University and Hardy Dilly's Deli but you can still get a great ready to go wrap or sandwich in 2 minutes and still make the flight that has started boarding  I am thrilled to see little locally owned shops have made it into the sky harbor airport and hope that people will remember that they are in fact supporting local establishments and not the big chains found at most airports.
This was probably the loudest restaurant I've ever eaten in My husband was sitting right next to me and we really had to raise our voices Our salad was missing a couple ingredients the cucumbers and peppers The sangria just tasted like cheap sangria nothing special The bread we ordered was plain and boring I have had better bread from the Wal Mart bakery Our pizza crust was burnt and flavorless The $11 dessert we had was probably the worst dessert I've ever had in restaurant It was the Dolce Della Casa which is a calzone filled w/ banana & hazelnut sauce We could hardly eat it because we needed a chainsaw to cut through the crust All that was inside was one measly banana We told the waitress we didn't like it and she said well sometimes it's hard to get it to cook just right She didn't take it off our bill or offer anything for us I feel bad because we were there for my husband's birthday and it was an awful experience.
When I was a kid my parents use to take us here to kill a few minutes of the day We were bored to death But wow has this place changed My kids love coming here and we spent hours exploring the dinosaurs gold panning and playing in the real jail cells (about the only thing I remember as a kid enjoying and they're still here) Highly recommended.
Wow the "mamma's spinach" pizza was really good Garlic spinach & fresh tomatoes was great even 2 days later.
French toast - NO BRAINER It's INSANE Tip: get one slice for a $1 more when added to an omelette That's plenty it's like eating dessert for breakfast it's so rich And spend the extra $1 for real maple syrup Five egg white omelette - pleasantly surprised that it was light and fluffyOatmeal with bananas and pecans with a nice selection of toppings Fresh squeezed OJ - a rarityThey have full range a decadently delicious fried french toast and perfectly made egg white omelette.
I parked in the Parking Garage got my parking ticket validated and still owed money for parking  The parking validation was worth $300  The charge for parking was $500 with $200 credit for the validation (not the $300 I was promised)  I paid the remaining $300 charge but then the machine wouldn't give me a receiptI am never going back to this location  It is off my radar from now on.
Our son gave us a gift card for my birthday after researching on Yelp and the card was waiting for us on arrival  Located in beautiful Old Scottsdale this wonderful gastropub is beautiful and trendy and the food is to die for  Our server Chris was amazing and recommended the Chainbreaker brew on draft since the Four Peaks Hef was no longer available and it was delish and we both had two  We started out with the bacon-fat heirloom popcorn which my wife didn't care for but I loved  Hey I'm a guy and there was crumbles of warm bacon all through it  Then we both split their famous chopped salad which Chris brought to the table unchopped and chopped right before our eyes  Honestly I got cold chills with the first bite  Hands down one of the best tastes ever in a salad with salmon tomato arugula couscous etc (recipe on Facebook) and delicious homemade Buttermilk ranch dressing--perfection and we could have eaten a whole one but wanted to save room for more delights to come  Chris recommended the scallops which I had already had my eye on so my wife ordered the buttermilk roasted chicken served over sweet corn-butter succotash with roasted Brussels sprouts  Moist and delicious  My scallops were wrapped in Tender Belly Hampshire bacon nestled in a bed of roasted corn grits and topped with wilted snow pea greens (yum) and drizzled with a cola gastrique  Tenderest and most tasty scallops ever  By the end of the night manager Owen stopped by to visit--he had been staring at our names for over a month on his bulletin board and he wanted  to put a face with our names  Chris joined us for the sit down and we had a wonderful conversation Wanting to try the peanut butter bread pudding Chris recommended the Guiness pudding jar instead which was a stout infused chocolate pot de creme over a chocolate shortbread cookie topped with Irish whiskey crema and two chocolate shortbread cookies on the side and served in an actual small jar with lid I threatened to take off Chris' hand when he reached to clear the plate with the remains of the last cookie still on it  Overall a perfect night with perfect food and service in a warm inviting atmosphere  It does NOT get any better than this  Thank you my son.
Great burgers and good prices  Their shakes are legit  You can combine flavors (oreo-coffee is my favorite)  Also they have fresh squeezed lemonade which is quite refreshing with your burger and fries.
This place is awesome This is the first Fogo I've been to but I've spent some time in Brazil and have had "real" BBQ As with most Brazilian BBQ places the strategy is to stay away from the salad bar and just load up on meat Having said that their salad bar is very fresh and is loaded with some pretty interesting items The asparagus was cooked perfectly (something I need with beef for some reason) One of the drawbacks from places like this is overcooked meat I prefer Medium rare to rare for high quality beef and the servers are more than willing to find you steaks that are cooked to your liking You're not going to get anything too exotic to choose from like you would in Braziliechicken hearts but it's a nice place in a convenient location Of course this is in Scottsdale so you know it's more upscale than it probably needs to be and that's fine with me.
If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum then you probably know Haji-Baba I however am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on TwitterSince then I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu The food is delicious Seriously there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyedOn my first trip I ordered the combination I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that It's easily enough for two people and at only around $12 a great deal tooOn my most recent visit I had the Gyro plate again amazing A very generous portion served with a delicious salad a side of rice and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffeeHaji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time If you want to eat there go for an early or late lunch otherwise you'll have to wait for a table it's worth itThey have a large menu and great prices and if you don't have time to stay and eat you can order to-go from the counterThe staff do a good job but their food is so good I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the doorIf you haven't tried it you need to go there If you have then you know just how great Haji-Baba is.
Stacy's SmokeHouse BBQ has grown and changed its name to Stacys Pit Stop BBQThey have added two hamburgers to their BBQ Menu and the new Cowboy Beans are just amazing There is for sure a reason why this spot is #4 in the country for the Best Foods Ever on the TLC-Food NetworkThere located at 8510 N 7th Street Phoenix AZ 85020 Between Dunlap and Northern on 7st)  (602)795-866811-9pm Mon-Thur Fri-Sat 11-11pm and Sundays 11-6pm.
The workers here were super friendly The food is on par with any other Jamba Juice The place was clean employees were super nice kept me company during an incredibly short wait (could have been because it was midday friday and raining) and even gave me a sweet coupon for next time.
Wonderful place I cannot say enough  good about Postinos Great food love the chicken salad:) Happy hour 11-5  (seven days a week) who doesn't  like that  Service is always perfect You will not regret your visit its a must :).
Wowzerz this was a great event What a way to kick off 2014Where was this place back when I lived down the street But I digress Salty Sow definitely adds some zest to an already nice block of restaurants Driving up the building pops out from the street Once inside we were greeted with aluminum water bottles and a challenge to find our New Year's resolution amongst the awaiting tables I wish I'd known because my resolution makes me sound illiterate Again I digressThe food was simply outstanding And the service: above superior I opted to try the sangria made with frozen grapes elderflower liquor and champagne So refreshing and not too sweet Our spread of delectables was hosted by none other than the general manager Beth and the chef Harold Marmulstein My favorites were the pork ragout pork shoulder and Brussels sprout leaves The flavors and consistency of everything tasted fresh and dynamic It's one of those menus that can do no wrong Desert was the icing on the proverbial cake Bananas Foster beignets and a butterscotch custard that had everyone swooning Thank you to Salty Sow and our gracious hosts for an amazing dinner with some great people And thanks to Lindsey and Yelp for letting us enjoy such excellent flavors and ambiance Congrats to all those Gold Elites out there - I hope to one day join your ranks See everyone on Yelp and the next event.
The doughnuts are fantasticOrdered a giant birthday doughnut and my car smelt like sugar the whole way home it was perfect  Customer Service was friendly  I'd go out of my way to stop here it's that yummy.
Best BBQ salad in the valley I challenge you to try it out.
This is as good as it gets when it comes to hot and cold sandwhiches Chips a toasted sandwhich and your set to run out the door If you're ever downtown check this out Only m-f though.
Just as great at the first timeWe had the tofu lettuce wraps and the chicken terriyaki rice bowl  Everything was super good and they even gave me a refill on my Arnold Palmer to go.
Relaxing atmosphere good food great serviceenough said.
Wow I am so impressed with the professionalism and personal care that I received here From the very beginning I knew I was in good hands and was not being overcharged or pressured into a thing If you are looking for personal one-on-one care for your vehicle this is the place.
I moved from Arizona so my review is for experiences up to 2/2008I LOVE this bar It's definitely my favorite place to go in Old Town The rare occasions that I'd go to Myst I would always come here first for the cheaper drinksPros-Lots of room to sitYou don't have to be dressed up at all to come hereHappy Hour 1/2 all wells beer wine and food M-F 4-7 (sidenote: it used to be 4-9 disappointed that they've shortened it)Relatively cheaper drinks than the rest of the bars in this area I would always drink during happy hour so bottles were less than $2Bartenders are super nice I've always chatted them up and service is pretty good Even when it's crowded on a weekend night you don't have to wait too long for a drink from the barThe WINGS Just try them I haven't had better wings anywhere elseThey stay open after 2 because they're a "restaurant" Great place to go after the other bars close for some foodCons-Cover after 8pm (or 8:30) Easy just get there before thenThe crowd changes around 10pm when all of the club people come here to pre-drink.
This not-so-little bookstore has it all new and used books a unique gift section book signings and events wonderful staff and a cool organized clean atmosphere  It's going to become a favorite 'down-time' spot for me I can tell already  It's right next to Wildflower Breads on McClintockSee ya there.
The first time I went to the Sail Gentlemen Afterdark was playing a super-rare reunion show and they blew the roof off the place Incredible band if you don't know 'em you're missing out First impressions: the Sail is intimate but also roomy with a decent amount of seating friendly bar staff and great sound It reminded me a lot of the old Wong'sonly less scuzzy (and I know scuzzy was part of the old Wong's charm) The Sail has live music every night with pretty much the best bands in town on a regular basis--a decent-sized indoor stage and a big outdoor stage The Zen Lunatics rule Thursdays with "Rockaroke"--a live-band karaoke that draws a great (and very diverse) crowd that frequently includes surprise appearances from a variety of well-known local musicians It didn't take long to become a regular Yeah the Sail charges a cover (usually just a couple of bucks which pays the bands and the excellent sound guy)--but the drinks are strong and cheap and they have a variety of good beers on tap It's a small price to pay for good bands every day of the week They go out of their way to support up-and-coming bands longtime valley musicians and visual artists--and it's a fun place to just hang out If you like the best live music and art Tempe has to offer there's no better place to be If you don't I think that Toby Keith's place is open Try the Krispy Fried Macaroni & Cheese.
Wonderful environment to watch a game great ambiance although it did take a while to get acknowledged when we sat at the bar Try the Ruben it's outstanding and prices are reasonable If you have to eat near the convention center and are crunched for time it's the perfect spot.
I'll never use another cheapy online tax program again after coming here These guys are awesome and did you know paying to have your taxes done is deductible on your taxes next year I didn't know that They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our complicated taxes and ended up getting us back several hundred dollars more than if we had done them online like we usually do They've earned a customer for life.
This place is so adorable I went here with a friend and the prices are really good The inside is on the small side but their outdoor patio is HUGE We ate outside on a lovely evening and I felt like I was at a Mexican-backyard-party It was a lot of fun and it is beautiful on their patio I can't wait to go back on another beautiful day.
Sanctum is the place to be in central Phoenix on a Wednesday night Its goth themed interior and hot bartenders are definately a huge plus I tend to join my friend on Wednesday who loves to dress in the goth clothes I dont however I just go in club clothes Its very inviting staff and customers make you feel in place The music switches to 80's and some goth its somewhere that you WILL know a song here and there LOL Drinks reasonably priced Beer was like $4 The art in this bar is SIMPLY AMAZING Check it out.
This Mesa location for Souper Salad has undergone drastic improvements in the last month or so and I would like to compliment them on a job well done Gone are the greasy tables and dirty heat lamps the permanently ill staff coughing on the dinner trays the poorly laid-out floor plan and the perennially dirty windows Now the place is open inviting and full of sunlight and air Yes it's closed now and the doors are locked but think of the favor they've done you--now you can't eat there if you tried.
Fun authentic pizza gelato and panini palace with attitude Large variety of reasonably priced rustic roman pizzas They'll make what you want or you can follow their quirky selections like shrimp & salmon potato with Rosemary or hotdog I tried the artichokes & olives as well as the wild mushroom mix and I was amazed They make their own mozzarella fresh for the pies and fill cannolis to order You won't believe this level of freshness.
Finally got to try the bread pudding  here and it was unbelievable Not as unbelievable as Charlestons but is definitely making the list for "Best Bread puddings" (see list) Also tried the tuna sammich with avocado as I wanted something simple That tomato herb bread that they use is extraordinary The sammich was great just like everything else I have had here.
Bandera's Chicken Enchiladas have set the standard for me  I doubt I will ever find a better mexican dish anywhere  The mix of Green and Red enchilada sauce is Bombcom/thebestieverhad.
I have not been here in a LONG time  I remember the burgers are YUM  But The Frenchy sandwich on the menu was screaming "GET ME GET ME ORDER ME"  But my friend saw that I was torn so she ordered the Vigazz Burger and offered to share  So I had 1/2 a Frenchy and 1/2 the Vigzz Burger  WOOOOOOOOOFrenchy - SO GOOD  Love the dipping sauceVigazz Burger - The zing from the sauce Yum  Cook to perfection burgerFrench Fries - Love those skinny fries with the seasoningThe service was great.
Thank goodness they opened a location near me I could probably eat the same dish there for the rest of my life or I guess I could try other dishes too But if it ain't broke why fix it.
I admit I only come here for the beer but what great beer they have My cousin loved the Peach Ale ( What girl wouldn't) and even I had to give it a double thumbs up The Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are my favs (when you can get them) And the Hopknot IPA is killer too Happy Hour is the time to go when pints are a smidgeon over $300.
Best coffee everAdd cream & sugar to make it even better.
I almost bought a used car at a traditional dealership They told me how they have the mechanic look over the car and they only sell cars in perfect condition I had my mechanic look it over and he found over $1200 in repairs needed The next day I went to see Bob Bloom at Centennial He showed me the carfax and the off site inspection and repair bill Centennial isn't a traditional dealership All the cars are inside and they set a fair price No need to negotiate We bought my son's first car from Bob and it was a great experience I recommend you call Centennial and ask for Bob you won't regret it Tell them Pat sent you :).
Mediocre food at best and overpriced.
The food at this place is so amazing   I can't wait to go back  I had the salmon pasty and it was a real joy to the mouth  There were 6 in our party and all of us were very happy with our food  My pasty was so large I could only eat half YEAH I get to have the other half tomorrow for lunch.
NoNoNoI've had it with this place I gave it several tries I even tried to convince myself that it wasn't THAT bad but it is- The sushi is TOO small Really It looks like a child's version of sushi My god it would take eight rolls to fill meFor the same price I'll keep going to the one restaurant at tempe martkeplace I'll take pretentiousness and overdone japanese furniture over crappy sushi anyday Sigh I wanted to like you Sushi 101 But you're like that boy I dumped in the 10th grade who talked a lot of talk but ended up being a total bore.
Ditto all the other positive reviews  So I'm just going to get right to it and just say you have to just go and experience LUSH for yourself  Let them know you are a first timer and they will take you for a tour through have they have  My favorite is the Love Lettuce Mask Reminds me that I need to go get more.
I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this place before I'm shocked and disappointed in myself Gelato Dolce Vita has been a favorite of mine since long ago (okay like five or six years) I lived in Queen Creek and whenever I went to Mesa to visit my friends we would inevitably end up here Every flavor is amazing and the owners are super friendly It really is the best gelato I've tasted outside of Italy And you know even some places in Italy didn't quite measure up Maybe I'm biased Who knowsJust trust me Check this place out That's my advice The end.
I love this restaurant  If you consider yourself a gourmand one who seeks the best in life one who searches for innovative cuisine or just a lover of real food you will appreciate Quiessence  Check out their website (or call) to get a sense of the menuThey make a magical Valentine's Day dinner (and will do it on the 13th if you like the idea but not the extreme madness in going out for that evening)  I kept my menu and will stare at it longingly forever  We did the wine pairing with each course mmmmmm  I just don't have the time and money at this point in my life to do that kind of work so taking advantage of someone else's tastes (as long as they are excellent) is a beautiful thing to me  Fresh ingredients - local ones where possible - and damn good ones  Wonderful wait staff with whom to discuss your gastronomic experience  Setting: lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees which includes Maya's Farm (produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays) and a brunch and lunch restaurant (all 3 are in separate areas/buildings)  Quiessence is pricey but definitely worth it  Take someone who will appreciate itUpdate 9 September 2007: We went here for our anniversary dinnermmm  Just as awesome as ever  I felt compelled to add a few things so people wouldn't be shocked when going there:- Portion sizes are fairly small so that you can choose one of each course  I'm sure that makes the prices (which you can find on the website under the menu) all the more shocking to some people  To me it's totally worth it- This restaurant is a good way to impress other people  Maybe your taste buds are poor but you are rich - you should still take people here :)  - Staff tip: amazing pears from Aravaipa Farms which has a bed & breakfast only about 25 hrs drive from Phoenix (on the way to Globe) but with a different microclimate http://wwwaravaipafarmscom/Update May 2008:  we went again for a celebratory dinner and got the brick oven table  I'm still so thrilled this place exists and that I can support it when my budget allows  The brick oven table with the wine pairings is a spendy (nearly $400 for the 2 of us) but worthwhile experience  The menu for the evening is personalized to your tastes  In the last year we found out one of us has a wheat allergy and one of us has a corn allergy  Those were some new things to accommodate and we mentioned that when making reservations expecting it to be accommodated  We had 8 courses and 9 glasses of wine each over the course of 55 hours  There was ample time to rest and relax in between courses and we were stuffed when we left (but  not unpleasantly so)  You're really in your own little private world at the brick oven tablefar enough from the noises of other diners to enhance your experience  Dustin was our server for the evening and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines  Some of the wine pairings were extraordinary with the food  Some were surprising (one that tasted like its Spanish coastal terroir served with shellfish)  There were a few things that disappointed me though  Our allergies were forgotten a few times though when that happened replacement food was brought out promptly  For the most part our allergies were attended to well  However dessert sort of ruined things  We were initially brought a selection of lovely cake-like and crust-laden desserts  I mentioned the wheat  They were replaced with two citrus sorbets one grapefruit one lemon and lemon creme brulees  This was served with tawny port  No no no  All that sour citrusand port  I let them know that didn't work at all  Surely something could have been made - a flourless chocolate cake perhaps  The lemon creme brulee on its own would have been fine but with all of that mouth-puckering sorbetI still love the place I'm still glad it exists the service is superior and I love the use of wonderful-tasting fresh local ingredients but that dessert didn't work  Thank goodness for the other 7 courses (including a whole fish we picked cleanin addition to our meat course)In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is "overpriced" or "overrated" have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors  Every main course I've had there was outstanding.
Met with John for a consultation  Gave him a deposit for an original piece of art for a tattoo  He came back with a piece that was traced right off of Google  Not a piece of original art  Not my idea a true good art work  Glad I didn't have him tattoo me.
I love this place  The pizzas are great but their salads are my favorite  I love the antipasto salad with their house made dressing  I have eaten here more times than I can count and will keep coming back for more.
Poor Quality rude employees My recommendation is the save up the extra funds and buy retail (if you have to have Coach.
This review has nothing to do with the food We have eaten at Famous Dave's in the past and was very pleased However we stopped by for lunch and had our dog with us I politely asked the Hostess if the patio was dog friendly for a well trained dog She asked the bartender who said noonly Service Dogs The patio is huge and no one was out there I think this is the first patio at a restaurant that we have been denied and IS NOT DOG FRIENDLY For that Famous Dave's you get 1 star Red Robin across the street gladly accommodated us.
I completely agree with the other review here  I legitimately thought it would be an Oktoberfest and not a San Tan Fest  If it's ONLY going to be San Tan beer and sub par food if not horribly done "german food" (bratwurst ONLY) then hold it at the end of September and call it something completely different  Omit Oktoberfest from the name because that was NOT an Oktoberfest  I will continue on with every other Oktoberfest in the state from now on as I now know the quality of the San Tan OktoberfestPS My boyfriend has been waiting to go to this Oktoberfest for 4 years and has not been able to go since he used to bartend weekends that caused him to be unable to go  PLUS his favorite beers on and off are the Devils Ale and the Hop Knot  I am not going to lie he was CRUSHED when he went to this event He had built this up to be at least a quarter of a typical Oktoberfest in his mind and it did not deliver at WHATSOEVER I will not subject him to this event again and when he said he'd rather go to the ballet he meant it  Try again San Tan.
Enjoying a great French country lunch.
BEST PLACE EVER I love coming here love the selection and low prices.
Finally - a PROFESSIONALLY- run glass companyFrom answering the phone to work done - completely professionalPrompt  Job well done  Fair pricesI highly recommend this company.
Went here with a friend who has been raving about this place for awhile When we pulled up I was a bit skeptical by the concrete building but the shop is very clean and cute inside The cookies are all slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - they're amazing I got a peanut butter and double chocolate The chocolate was probably the best chocolate cookie I've ever had I also bought a carrot cake cupcake with cream cheese frosting The frosting was delicious and the cupcake was very moist - I usually throw away the cake part after eating the frosting but I actually wanted to eat the whole thing.
This is one of my favorite burger placesand it doesn't hurt that they make some fantastic martinis to go with :)The sweet potato fries are the best in the city - if I say so myself (and I think I've tried them all)  Sometimes you have to wait here but it is always worth the extra time.
2/19/1345 starsReceived a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only) so I stopped by after work  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks I knew I was going to try two new (to me) pasta dishes the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta and a half (crustless) Tuscan saladI was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections and sure enough I liked what I tried and asked for a glass  I placed my food order tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK and he said "no problem") and asked if I could have some table bread as wellTen minutes passed and I still hadn't received any bread nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered but I was reading while I waited so I wasn't too worried although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on  Around five to ten minutes later my dishes arrived and these came with a dinner roll each so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home)  The salad was still missing so when my server came by for a check-up I mentioned it and he said he'll look into it  A few minutes later a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived  (Because of the mix-up the salad was on the house- thanks Crust)The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdaleselect=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w#FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w  When I order creamy dishes whether it's Italian or Thai I like the sauces silky and rich in flavor and this dish certainly fulfilled my expectations  The ravioli was cooked al dente (perfetto) and the tangy artichokes served to cut the buttery richness of the sauce  I LOVED every bite  The sauce also went well with the dinner roll  Squisito  As for Grandma's Pasta http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdaleselect=Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ#Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ I can take it or leave it  One problem I had with it was that the ricotta was too cold and I found the clash of hot and cold in this pasta dish a little strange  I also found that the small chunks of sausage were much tastier than meatballs and I found myself wishing the dish just contained sausage links instead of the meatballs which is a shame since the meatballs are HUGE  Last but not least the Tuscan salad was delicious  Loved the peppery arugula dressed in a housemade Italian vinaigrette and the white beans and when I read "homemade croutons" I expected the usual cubed chunks of bread not the toasted and seasoned slices of bread that adorned the bowl  http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdaleselect=h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg#h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg  I could order this salad as an entree and a glass of white and be happyWith so many dining options to choose from in this valley of the Sun it's great to know that whenever I do dine at Crust dinner specials or not I can always find a great meal and walk out happy and satiated**To receive Crust specials via SMS text CRUST to 91944.
The place has the best Riesling in the world Went here on sat night and had the spinach dip ( so good) and for dinner we had Thai steak salad $20 (amazing) and the Hawaiian rib eye $34 (yummy) and for desert we had the key lime pie which was great but the ice cream dessert was not good at all over all the food was amazing but the price was a little high.
How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana" so they just combine them into a made up word (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA)"Parmagiana" is a style of cooking "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghettiGod People can be so stupid.
Fail Whale Ok I know this is not twitter so there isn't REALLY a fail whale But if this was they would get oneWe got a menu from them on our door so after getting back from vacation and being completely jet lagged we orderedI was on hold on the phone a while No biggie Finally they took my order  We both went for calzones I figured it was the easiest way to ensure it was vegetarianWRONGNot only did it take over an hour to show up AND they charged us a delivery fee (so two calzones became over $20) but the sauce had a very heavy meat taste One bite and I couldn't eat anymore Not only that but because they put the sauce IN the calzone as well as on the side I couldn't eat anything  I tried to nibble the crustMy partner who is not veggie LOVED her calzone and killed in in about 5 minutes Both of us then spent the rest of the evening in bed moaning and groaning with stomach aches and there may have been a few trips to worship the porcelin gods as wellFail.
Muy mas caliente but my favorite restaurant in Phoenix It's not swanky and sometime you can feel like they're rushing your through But the food is savory and very very hot.
I really love PF ChangsAnd no I don't think its really authentic and that is not even a reason why I love this place So without further ado my four favorite dishesFirst: PF Changs has the BEST chicken noodle soup EVER Forget the egg drop forget the hot and sour try this delicious soup It's a lemony spicy-ish chicken broth with cherry tomatoes mushrooms pieces of chicken cilantro and these weird looking noodles It might not sound good but TRUST ME it isSecond:  the fried green beansYUMMY Super crunchy and delicious and the dipping sauce is phenomenalThird: shrimp and candied walnuts OK I never thought I would like a dish with melon balls in it [unless it was like a fruit bowl] but this has definitely changed my mind Basically battered and fried shrimp with this creamy sauce with candied walnuts and melon balls I can't convince you it's good with any of my words you just need to try it lolFourth: Dalhi Chicken It's super spicy [spiciest dish] with sliced potatoes If you don't like spicy DON'T GET THIS Try the chang's spicy chicken instead [which is not spicy to me] lolYOU'RE WELCOME ].
So I read all the wonderful reviews and thought how great--fabulous food at the airport  I was seated promptly and spoke to the waitress Christina about vegetarian options and on her recommendation ordered the veggie burger (no bun) and the side veg of broccoli rab which she described as "yummy"and asked for a glass of water with a slice of lemon Water arrived: no lemon Food arrived delivered by someone other than Christina Burger on large slab of iceberg lettuce I  took a first bite of burger--lukewarm temp But the sauce on the side was good Brocolli rab was cold When (with the assistance of the gentleman at the next table) I was finally able to get Christina's attention I asked if the vegetable was supposed to be cold No she said So I sent it backTake two: at my prompting Christina reached over to the bar and dumped a piece of lemon into my glass of water A third person came to my table with a veggie burger and broccoli rab but no sauce I tried to point out to him that the sauce was missing and he waved me away I tried the brocolli rab the second time--this time literally handing a piece to Christina and asking her if she thought it was warm She didn't She asked me how the burger was this time around and I said that as I was still waiting for the sauce chances were that if it were hot it wouldn't be by the time that I got the sauce and a third try on the vegetablesDecided to find a place that can actually serve hot food--maybe even the first time So much for fab food at the airport.
It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair all the negatives come from their Gilbert location the auwatukee location has always been good  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time  In the four of the last five visits I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner but once we received our water/Ice tea they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter  Minor maybe but when the food was delivered to the table one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes was told they would get it right out  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill  Again with apologies he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else.
Rude rude rude I will *never* go back to this place I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks) When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me "we have signs everywhere" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY) I went to an ATM and pulled out cash it wasn't that big of a deal but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever I won't ever go there again Steer clear.
I went here last night with a hankering for steak and let's just say I still have a hankering.
Nates barber shop is one of the best shops that I have encountered in my life If your looking for a great inexpensive ($13) good looking haircut this is your place The father & son are both great professional & customer friendly barbers I highly recommend this place to anyone.
Glad to see them on the map after winning Cupcake Wars Their cupcakes rival if not beat Sprinkles Brown Velvet Peach-Berry Shortcake and Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese (sounded weird) but that last one was on Cupcake Wars and it was surprisingly really good as well Not to mention their stuff is all organic (hence the brown velvet instead of red) Definitely get their cupcakes and you won't be disappointed Just try and keep yourself from going too many times Hasn't worked well for our family yet lol.
Hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ  If you are a pepperoni pizza person you HAVE to try Grimald's pepperoni and ricotta pizza it's amazing  I visit both locations in Scottsdale the one in Old Town and the one in DC Ranch  Old Town gets really busy around dinner time on the weekends and DC Ranch is a little easier to get seated on the weekend  Both are really good.
Best Hawaiian in town this place was a staple for me in the college years  I could live off the manapua  The humble decor leaves you in for an even better surprise when you taste the food  Had a friend that lived in Hawaii for several years and he said the food here was just like home  They have music on some days and advertise cultural events happening in the valley  Fun cheap good eats.
I went to this place because the front of their takeout menu said "NY Style Chinese Restaurant"  It was anything but  I'm from New York and my favorite Chinese dish is Szechuan Beef  And in New York all Chinese restaurants make it the same way: dry shredded beef with carrots celery and scallions cut into matchsticks and bits of chili peppers  I don't know what they were thinking by calling the stuff they gave me Szechuan Beef  It was slices of beef (not dry-fried shredded) it was in a tomato-ey sauce with hunks of peppers onions celery mushrooms water chestnuts and everything else they probably had leftover lying around It wasn't spicy (even though it said spicy on the menu) Their hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour It wasn't the rich brown fragrant soup I remember from NY it was slightly gelatinous light amber and had barely any flavor It looked and tasted like doctored-up chicken soupI also got an order of pork fried-rice  The pork was ok but the rice was BRIGHT ORANGE and had no flavor Since when is fried rice supposed to be orange  Didn't have the bits of egg either It's as if they started with bland leftovers and tried to "spice" (I use that term with great sarcasm) it up with food coloring to try to pass it off as flavorful Well it fell flatI would recommend Panda Express over this sham of a chinese restaurant I'm angry I wasted $12.
So amazingly delicious  Every time I go there I have to get the of course chicken and waffles  And my boyfriend and I share a side of home fries which are just the potatoes are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside and seasoned to perfection  Someday I will branch out and try their other menu items I'm sure you can't go wrong no matter what you order herePro tip:  Make sure you bring your appetite.
This loc is so quick and efficient with pickup Love the convenience of online-ordering Veggie fajita bowl rocksand just found out they'll use unsalted rice on request.
I've gotten some nice haircuts at this place or at least decent  Last time I used my credit card to pay and they had trouble getting it to go through  The girl kept running it over and over  then eventually rebooted their system and ran it again  This took about as long as the cut  Later I see on my statement that I was double billed  I have talked with them in person and on the phone a few times but I still have not gotten the extra charge reversed  It's not worth my time anymoreIf you go there you will probably like your haircut but bring cash.
Mike's is a great place for a Philly cheesesteak The owner is a nice guy we see & talk to him each time we go in I lived in Philly for a while and I've been looking for a place that could serve a Philly up the way I had it back then Mike's got it covered The prices are good and and he really works hard to make his customers happy The Philly is a good size and fills me up so much that I can barely touch the fries  I recently discovered their onion rings and added them to my list of cravings Then they've got some good ice cream to satisfy our sweet tooth I've lost track of the times that my husband has brought Mike's home Their Philly's do great as take out they don't get mushy after the car trip home (we're about 5 miles away) Enjoy.
Cool little spot Love the bar and the couches for lounging and enjoying a glass of vino Food is also really nice I love the beet salad with chicken There is something about the chicken always moist and flavorful Highly recommend.
Great place to watch an Iowa game if you are in the Phoenix area and the atmosphere is a huge reason  The uber hot waitstaff is another  U of Iowa fans get drunk and rowdy  Since game times are at 9 people arrive early and get breakfast  Lots of HDTVs all tuned to the Iowa game  There is a huge and loyal Iowa following in the Scottsdale area so seats fill up quick  Drinks are pricy but the hotness of the waitresses tend to distract from the bill  It is HIGHLY recommended to attend the Iowa vs Iowa State football games at the Sandbar  It is INSANITY Looking for more Iowa Natives to review this bar though.
Very fashionable interior  Very comfortable   This was my first pedicure and I wanted to go someplace where the employees spoke English as their first language  Also someplace where snobbery didn't abound  Fuchsia is all this and more  Talented staff excellent serviceHowever my pedicure was a gift and I don't know how much they charged  Seems like it would be expensive.
$79 for 10 shirts and a suit WOW that's what I get for trying to support my local business  RIP OFF ALERT.
Easily my favorite Filipino restaurant ever of all-time hands down Their prices are reasonable for exceptional food and drinks Has a well stocked bar plenty of TVs This a great place for event dinners as well The staff is very generous and easy to talk to Most places have pros and cons this restaurant the exception for having all pros If you try this place then I'd expect to see a review similar to this.
So I came on here to "Rag on Red" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it After having a great brunch at St Francis across the parking lot my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in Well first of all I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while Which was fine we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer They bothered themselves to greet us at that point Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit (I've worked my way through college/law school doing retail big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed)Soooo I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store whenGASSSSSPPPP I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything WhateverI was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas its their store if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business What blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair An Egg Chair You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about  Anyway I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air.
Always a long wait but the food is worth it  Their bacon is the best.
Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town we're touring musicians so fresh fast inexpensive food is super important to us on the road We got excited as soon as we walked in the door You could smell the freshnessWe had a hard time deciding but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben Both were fabulous and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well We so wish we had a place like this at home.
Loved this placetook my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool Cant wait to go back.
They're back as of today and they're awesome I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening todaySolid yelp reviews sold me and they did NOT disappointThey opened at 5:00 but I got off of class at about 4:15 so I went down there and hung around for a bit After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly) I placed my order I was the first customer yay Amazingly the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly In terms of "disasters" that's a pretty minimal one I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hourI had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end)Best burger I've had I think ever All the ingredients were high quality very nice cheddar cheese mushrooms cooked with port and garlic aioli And the bun Oh damn the bun Feathery is the best adjective No unevenness in texture light and just barely strong enough to contain the burger well maybe not entirely containThe red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish but it was tastyBoth the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff They seemed very happy with their choicesThey've got beer wine and hurricanes Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch I snuck a peek at the brunch menu and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week graduallyWhat are you doingYeah YouWhy are you still reading thisGo get a burger or something from hereBlah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open sure whatever maybe that excuse will fly with your family but not here mister/missy.
I was anxious to try this place because I heard such great things but boy was I wrong  I ordered deliveryjust a simple hot dog onion rings and tacos  Not only did they take an hour and a half to deliver the food but then I was lectured because I didn't have cash to tip them (you know because all other delivery places I've ordered from allow to tip on the card you pay with)  She was rude and almost refused to give me the food because I didn't have cash tip  Then when I actually tasted the food I was even more disappointed  The hot dog was ok but the bun tastes like butter so that's pretty much all you can taste  The onion rings were disgusting and we didn't even bother trying the tacos  We went straight to Indulge burgers---better food and better service  Skip this place for sure.
Just had an incredible weekend at the Bespoke Inn If you like any of these this place is for you: 1 location within a block of all of downtown Scottsdale's great restaurants with free parking at the inn 2 design Kate and Rob's sense of style is a mixture of complete awesomeness 3 new and clean they've only been open 6 months the place is spotless 4 food Kate and Rob are foodies we brought six for dinner on Saturday night 4 courses great food great setting in the courtyard and great conversation with the other guests 5 bicycling whether you are a hardcore mtn biker or road biker or a more casual bike pather Rob has a bike shop on premise and will hook you up He was a racer so is passionate about the sport and can point you in the right direction to the areas best riding 6 tranquility the courtyard is an amazing oasisRob and Kate and incredible hosts They are down to earth with a touch of class You will feel like a friend after hanging out with them a bit The place is beautiful We can't wait to go back with a handful of our closest friends to rent out the whole place We will be back.
Since it's the middle of the month I payed only $4 for this month for the unlimited car wash package With all the stuff you get like Scented Soaps Soft Foam Scrubs Spot Free Rinse Rim & Tire Scrub Clear Coat Protection Triple Foam Polish Undercarriage Power Wash Turtle Ice Wax/ Paint Protectant Rime & Tire Cleaner Choice of Air Freshner Tire Shine for $20 it's well worth it.
OMG the 2 guys in the LUMBERS DEPARTMENT are amazing and they're very professional with theirs work  VERY helpful with what you need you gota give this place a try.
I have come here religiously for the past 4 years (every 2 weeks) and have never been disappointed  Every nail artist in the salon is amazing and they have the best service  The prices for N Scottsdale are very decent  I love the spa pedicure (with the sea salt and the french)  Super clean with new tools on each client  They recently expanded so they have twice the space - their massage chairs are amazing  And even down to the spa owner's little daughter who helps take your money on occasion  It's definitely a family atmosphere here  I bring my mom girlfriends sisters here whenever they are in town  A nice treat for such a great price.
I just celebrated my birthday here this past weekend and I have nothing but awesome things to sayFirst off I know the private rooms are for bigger- more spendy types but Modern Steak accomodated 18+ of my friends (after I changed the number like 3 times) Everyone from the VIP party person to the hostesses that answered my calls were super awesome and welcoming When we got there immediately went to the chic bar and had a few drinksCan't go wrong with a little Dirty Goose but it was nice that they also had the Bleu Cheese Olives for my Kettle Dirty friends:)We all caught up at the bar and sat in one of the rooms and I felt like a Princess sitting at the head of the tableMaple Salmon -- Delish Mac and Cheese to die for and whoever thought about combining bread with bacon needs to get a RAISE And the topping to the evening was my awesome birthday Dessert Whoever is the Chocolate Writer there is absolutely wonderful and it added a little extra to my wonderful dessertThank you Modern Steakcan't wait to dine here again.
This is the best bbq in phoenix omg I am a fan of any place that serves meat by the lb and uses a beverage crate as a plate I ordered the pork spare ribs (I asked for a full pound and didn't need it) the rub was spicy and the meat was moist and just about fell off the bone We also had the mac and cheese homemade and perfect My husband ordered the Texas Po Boy sandwich a full pound of meat Smoked sausage brisket and pulled pork it was so flavorful He also ordered the green beans I didn't try them but he said they were very tasty The staff was very friendly The chef (maybe owner) gave us a sample of brisket We got there before 7 (closing time) but no one rushed us and the waitress even stood and chatted with us for a bit When we are on this side of the valley again we will definitely be eating there again.
I will drive across town to go to other Trader Joe's so that I do not have to go to this location again The non refrigerated produce is mostly organic I think it is great that TJ's offers so many organic options but I personally choose not to buy organic Hate me if you want to I don't care but if you are giving the option of choosing organic then I should have the option not too By not carrying a large selection of non organic vegetables I am forced to buy them at a higher price mind you or doing without I noticed the same with the meat I understand that this location is space challenged but I do not appreciate having to purchase the more expensive product because management has made the decision not to carry the basics The second complaint I have is that they have a few register lanes but usually only 1 or 2 are open and they just let the lines build up without opening any more My third complaint is that the last time I was there I bought a reusable bag but not all of my groceries would fit in it so I had to use the paper bags I did not double bag them and I packed them full to the brim except for the last one The last bag had about 4 delicate items in it and the cashier an elderly woman with gray hair had the nerve to take them out of the bag put them on top of my other packed bags and fold the bag up and put it away Seriously I spent over $100 and I'm begrudged 1 paper bag Come on.
Stopped by for dinner on our way to a Dbacks game and never made it to the game  They have a great twist on traditional dishes and the beer selection is amazing  Great place for people watching too  Can't think of a single fault.
A native San Franciscan in Arizona for grad school I have searched far and wide for a place comparable my beloved Axis and Ritual cafes At Lux I found my home at a place with the best desserts in the desert.
Simple simple simple rental procedures And great prices too Come here to rent a paddleboard kayak hydrobike pedal boat 18' electric surrey or pontoon boat Hello fun This little rental shop is literally right on Tempe Town Lake so it's the most convenient location ever The kayaks paddleboards hydro-bikes and pedal boats all run somewhere between $15 and $25 per hour which is a killer price An hour is plenty of time to go out for a rousing little water adventureMy spectacular gal-pal and I opted for the 2 person kayak We put her in the back to "steer" since she's a more experienced water-sport-er than I she was even on a rowing team once I sat in the front and acted like I knew what I was doing but I didn't It was fun anyway Now you aren't supposed to get in the water and swim and you probably don't want to anyway because yuck-o but this doesn't stop water from getting onto you Your rear-end will get wet in the kayak for sureNext we tried the HYDRO-BIKES The best invention ever Riding a bike on water It was almost biblical I felt quite stable and safe up out of the water You'll never get wet on this thing unless someone rams into you It's a bit hard to steer and control but doesn't take long to get used to Sooooooo funLastly we decided to paddleboard which is something else I've never done I stayed on my knees for a bit because I was honestly a bit horrified I felt like I'd surely tumble into the water and embarrass everyone plus I was having a horrendous time trying to steer No matter what I did I just kept drifting further out to sea For about 2 whole minutes I felt very dramatic and like I was probably lost forever But then I got over it and stood up (easier to paddle for sure duh) and rowed my way back homeA seriously fun time on Tempe Town Lake was had and I thank Tempe Town Lake Boat Rentals for providing us with quality equipment awesome service and staff (they held onto all of our belongings and even took several pictures of us being all sporty) and great prices Woo.
This place is awesome It's my new favorite Indian restaurant My boyfriend and I eat here so much we worry that the owners will think we're stalking them My favorite new discovery there is the Samosa Chaat I'm extremely picky about Indian food and am rarely impressed so for this place to be right in my own neighborhood is a dream come true.
We arrived at Portlands hungry after checking out several other downtown spots and finding them lifeless Portlands looked great from the outside especially after the 'vacant lot' surroundings of other downtown spots  We walked into Portlands finding it near-deserted and ICY cold - on a lovely warm summer's evening  So we asked to be seated outside the host told us to seat ourselves outside which we did  We waited a LONG time for a server - we were thirsty and hungry and still had not been given menus or water  There was only one other table occupied inside and a few folks at the bar  so we could not understand the delay  Finally a waiter arrived handed us menus and proceeded to explain some complicated arrangement along the lines of " the outside is really closed but I will give you menus and then you can come inside  "  I was so angry I got up and walked out  My partner explained that maybe they just wanted to come inside to order - that we would be served the food outside but I didn't interpret what she said that way  but anyway - the place was EMPTY so a) why was it an ice-box and b) why could we not sit where we wanted Was it too far for the waiter to walk outside  I'm really trying to give the downtown restaurants a chance in Phoenix but - after this we jumped in our car and drove to downtown Scottsdale where we found a lively bar/restaurant and had a great meal  I really wish this place well - but I doubt I'll be returningAnd PLEASE - all restaurants take note - not many people want to sit in 60-degree air when it is a near-perfect 85 outside  I figure the A/C thermostat is set by some waiter who is hot from running in and out of the kitchen  we diners aren't looking for an arctic experience.
BEST CHEESE-STEAK IN ARIZONA  BEST MEATBALL SUBS IN THE WESTI am from New Jersey and have eaten all up and down the east coast  this place is a real jewel only authentic italian deli i have found here in arizona Try the cheesesteak on the italian baguette (crispy outside soft inside)  Pasta deli you can't go wrong here It's important to understand that everything is home made and takes time  more than you may think approx 15-20 minutes for most orders CALL YOUR EAT IN ORDER AHEAD OF TIME- then you will love coming here often  they sell limited quantities of pizza dough daily to make at home  it's amazing and cheap.
If I could give it less than 1 star I would  I don't understand all the people raving about this place the food is horrible They must be friends or getting paid for their reviews Every roll is a really bad California roll with Krab meat and horrible to mediocre toppings on top I ordered a spicy tuna role since it's pretty hard to mess up wow was I wrong The roll was the nasty California role with chopped tuna on top and there was  absolutely no spice to the role I was told by the waitress 'that's how we make our spicy roles' This confused me  since the definition of spicy is ' seasoned with or containing spice'  so their spicy roles are not really spicy roles  I will give them this the roles are big and inexpensive but who cares when they are basically inedible .
Well another AMAZING time at SwitchThank You for the perfect service from Tim Lotthe is the BEST in the businessWe took a new friend there last Saturday and she had a blast  Relatively new to Arizona from LA she was impressed with the urban vibe eclectic menu and great service from Tim 2 for 1 happy hour great apps non stop attention who would not be happy   Well I could not say anything that has not been already saidjust GO Ask for TIM and enjoy.
Love the atmosphere the patios drinks and especially the chicken lollipops  If you haven't tried them they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record booksI am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game  Not too stuffy but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
Who doesn't love a good dive bar The Rusty Spur is awesome If you haven't been here you need to go ASAP This place always has live music and they take suggestions from the crowd which is fun It's tiny in there but I think it adds to the atmosphere There's all sorts of fun things all over the walls that are cool to look at and the drinks are cheap I would be really shocked if you didn't have a good time here even if you aren't that into country music It's just very western/old school Arizona feeling and a fun change from the rest of the bars in Old Town (it's also sort of away from the rest of the bars) When I graduated from college my dad my stepmom and I all went to Saba's bought boots put them on and walked over to Rusty Spur to get our drink on I highly suggest you do the same ).
This place is legit  It's nice to have a change from other typical lame coffee shops that you see in airports  I got the "Iced Dirty Chai Latte" and it didn't disappoint  If I find myself in this airport in the middle of the desert again I'll be coming back  Good job guysPS  Kinda reminds me of the Better Buzz Lab in San Diego CA (Pacific Beach).
My favorite mall in the Phoenix area and one of my favorite malls on the planet The mall itself speaks luxury and completely puts you in an upscale environment The area around the mall compliments it even more and you can't help but love the mall inside out The people who shop here aren't the friendliest and some seem to think they're above God but that don't stop me from loving the overall experience of shopping here The mall is also the location of the first ever Microsoft Store and the largest Dillard's store And you could always find me shopping in places like Express Guess Armani Exchange Burberry and others I can't seem to get enough of this mall and seem to compare all upscale shopping malls to Scottsdale except for the ones in Vegas.
Amazing as always The classic philly cheessteak will never let you down Fast service great food.
I am a big sandwich fan These are delish The sesame bread is the best It has a light crust with the perfect give and soft interior Parking is horrible but it's worth it to find someplace to park My fiancé LOVED the roast beef and he is not a sandwich personThe decor is cute and the service is super friendly If you love sandwiches try it It's better than any chain I have tasted.
After reading the good reviews on Yelp my friend and I decided to meet at 5th and Wine for happy hour yesterday What a nice experience Friendly service fun decor good food and wine What more do you need It is a sizable restaurant with tables cozy chairs bar seating and outdoor seating We sat outside to enjoy the great weather We took advantage of their $5/glass happy hour special Pretty much every wine on the list is only $5 a glass Upon our waiter's recommendation I had a nice glass of Ch Ste Michelle "Indian Wells" Cabernet Sauvignon The bruschetta ($2 off) were a lot like Postino's decadent bruschetta a close rival but I would say Postino's has a very slight edge We got the following combos and all were delicious I don't think I could pick a favorite but I am a sucker for the Prosciutto-Fig combo *Tomato Mozzarella Basil Balsamic Reduction (excellent fresh tomatoes)*Apples Brie Fig Jam Honey and Agave Drizzle*Roasted Peppers Goat Cheese Garlic Tomato Jam*Prosciutto Mascarpone Cheese  Figs Tomato JamWe shared a large Strawberry Gorgonzola salad for dinner pretty standard as far as that style of salads go but good All the proportions of add ins were good (plenty of strawberries pecans gorgonzola) I'll definitely be going back soon There are several menu items I want to try (especially the 5th and Wine Burger).
By far the best Mexican food place around I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid and the food is always up to par You know what you are getting when you go Sometimes the service can be streaky but overall one of the better places to go Last time i tried their Cheese crisp extraordinaire It was freaking amazing I love when you pile steak bell peppers cream cheese onions and more into a cheese crisp.
This is one of my favorite hangouts The staff is always friendly and have great memories and social skills It is nice to always be greater with a smile and warm greeting no matter who is working This coffee shop has amazing pastries made from scratch daily with a good variety I have never had a problem finding an available outlet which is pretty rare in a coffee house so centrally located and that does good business You wont be disappointed Cute and has a lot of character.
Worth every penny love Pat & Michelle.
I am a fanLove the new Coca-Cola fountain machines.
The Glass Shop Is Great I had a broken window i called that night and they came that night to fix it It was as quick and easy as it gets It could not of gone any smoother There was no problems whatsoever On top of that my window looks great Much better then it did before I am 100% Happy Any time i have any kind of Window or Auto Glass problems i will be calling the The Glass Shop.
Best Mexican restaurant in the valley definitely the priciest too but if your willing to spend then it's the place to go.
I have ate here a few times and found it pretty descent Tonight I go with my wife & I order a Gyro Entree I was sitting right in front of the prep area As I sat there part of my to go order was sitting waiting for the rest to be completed the owner (I believe) brought out a gyro entree to a table behind where I was waiting The young lady indicated they ordered a Chicken gyro entree The owner brought it back behind the counter & spoke with the young man prepping the food The young man took that food that was brought back from a table (I will also mention that the customer had touched the food) next thing I know as quick as it was brought back it was in a to go container & was handed my food I questioned the owner about it he addressed the young man prepping the food & they denied it right to my face It is highly insulting as they knew I was standing right there watching this take place Not only is that a health code violation but to lie right to my face when I seen it with my own eyes This place is disgusting what happens that you don't see  Stay away I will tell all my friends and neighbors to stay away.
I was really looking forward to a great smoothie for lunch At first they said it was too watery and said they were going to remake it As I watched they poured it back in the mixer for a quick remix and then poured it into a cup It was still watery and was probably the worst smoothie I have ever hadSo disappointed.
My wife and I seem to be on the hunt for the perfect breakfast place here in North Scottsdale  Many to choose from and Butters is our new favorite  First of all the atmosphere on the patio was our first hint that we'd like it here  There is a fountain right off the back and the sounds and smells that make for a pleasant experience  They were also playing fun music on the patio as well  Nothing loud or obnoxious but it was a welcomed addition on a Sunday morning  Secondly this is somewhat like a cafe  They have a barista bar there and the latte my wife got was very tasty and my coffee was very excellent  Our meals were very good as well  When it comes to breakfast foods you don't need to reinvent the wheel  They served good food and at a good price and great atmosphere  We will definitely be back**Update**We went back again this Sunday and had another great experience  The service was awesome and the food was even better  I went out on a limb and tried something I usually wouldn't get the Corned Beef Hash Skillet topped with over easy eggs  It was amazing  It also was a lot of food  I ate about half of it but I am so glad I tried it.
What a fun place to shop Had heard about this via the internet and had to drive into Phoenix just to check it out When i was looking around i was told that the entire store was 50 percent off so i went crazy girls it's amazing what queens will donate Found loads of goodies and will make it a point to go every time I'm in town.
Very pleased on my first visit to Los Taquitos Very clean casual simple menu and GREAT FOOD My husband and I both ordered the street taco meal absolutely delish The beans were simple but out of this world flavor Staff very kind and quick For 2 dinners and a soda $16 Can't wait to go back and try everything else Los Taquitos has to offer.
Now normally I would not give a whataburger this low of a rating But back in Dec on a vacation I came back from a bar late on a Sunday night went to this whataburger and they had no meat We went to the drive up menu where greeted Told them it would be a minute We took ten minutes and finally when we decided what we wanted we where THEN told they where out of meat Sigh.
The pizza might be good but the pasta and sauce is terrible It's basically mid-west EYEtalian style Only seasoning used is sugarStaff is ok but the environment is straight out of the 70s.
AWESOME Greens golf course layout has a little bit of this and that and the staff is great a must play golf course.
When you have lived in Hawaii when you have experienced and understand the Aloha spirit and all that it contains you also will understand that food is important to the culture   I can tell you stories about trips planned to infamous restaurants and eateries all over the islands based on lengthy conversations with many who live there  Yes good food is appreciated by the island folksso lets transition to Arizona where you can still find some folks from the islands  As was the case there the conversation quickly turns to great places to eat and where to find that great island style food that we grew to love  I was so excited to find that this place was good and super close to where we live  We have been there often since  We have even used them to cater our oldest sons Hawaiian stlye Bday party last year   Food is great local style   Just what the Dr ordered   A bit of Aloha in Arizona cant get better than that.
Is there anywhere else in the Valley that does bruschetta this yummy I think not Love their catering too.
I've only had the buffets but I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's consistently AMAZING  My boys 5 and 8 ask to eat here  The week buffet doesn't have as large as an assortment as it does on the weekend but the price is less than the weekend  With the food being made fresh and in-house--- the price is well worth it  Great attentive staff as well as friendly  We always feel welcomed and appreciated and WE ALWAYS LEAVE FULL & HAPPYThank you.
Loved my haircut Walked in and waited for just a minute The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
good food their tortas and chimichangas are delicious :Danyone know what oil they use on their meats/breads thanks.
Good food for a great deal  They make it fast and the price is right I would come here most mornings if I could  Since moving to their new larger location even with a large crowd there is not much waiting if any.
You know what  This has been such a great place to shop lately I think it's time to move them up to 5 Stars  Here's why:*  Amazing sale prices  EIGHT Avocados (not ONE) for $1  Excellent quality boneless skinless chicken breasts $169/lb and tasty free marinade to make them even better  Beef  Tender boneless Cross Rib Steaks or Roast $249 lb () & free marinade available for them too  Just ask at the big meat counter (which is another plus to this store)  Then there are the bananas 25¢ a pound and so on  Wow  So many great other specials too every week*  A good inexpensive restaurant inside  (See my review for Dos Ranchitos Cafe)*  Fast & friendly customer service*  Interesting Mexican style events held here often  Today for instance a guy out in the parking lot had a machine with a big wire drum & four big blow torches blasting flame into it "air broiling" hundreds (thousands) of Pablano chiles & oh what a great smell  (See photo)*  A real screwball mix of customers - great people watching while you enjoy your tasty lunch here"Woohoo"  for this bigbusy noisy fun supermarket     :-)).
Excellent lunch  We were in the area and based on the reviews I figured it's worth a try  The club sandwich and the asparagus & havarti panini were both excellent  And the delicious cookie was a nice touchIts a small cafe with like 10 or 15 tables  You order at the counter and they bring your food  The coffee is self serve  There's a nice sandwich selection along with salads soup and some breakfast sandwiches  Not to mention all the bakery itemsThe food is fresh and tasty  And a good value the sandwiches are under $7It was definately worth the try  We don't get to this area much but Bertha's just might be worth a special trip.
This place is very coolAfter having dinner at Humble Pie and seeing all the hype going on over at this little joint I knew I had to check it out Grabbed lunch with my intern here mid afternoon on a Friday It's an entirely remodeled home turned into a restaurant Go inside and you can see where the lviing room with fireplace used to be and the kitchen area too All redone to be intimate seating and a very quaint but stocked bar area Even the bathroom looks old school like they just moved in and the prior residents were just there It's pretty coolWe sat on the patio which had a ton of great seating Couches for hanging and drinking probably to a little 3 chair bar area and plenty of patio tables with a great umbrella in the middle Also to the side is this super funky old tractor contraption that now is a glorious fountain resting on a mountain of giant rocks It's very cool So out of place but I dug itThe wait service was fantastic She wasn't pushy but attentive too We orded the baby blue and the BLT The baby blue had the sweetest chewiest walnuts ever and what looked like perfect amount of blue cheese too Apple slices wer cut super thin and drizzled with a yummy dressing I had the BLT which came with a chipolte mayo saice and avacado Yeah that's right The bacon was cooked to be extra crunchy and served on the best locally grown lettuce and tomatos They give you kettle chips and a pickle spear Hands down that damn pickle was stellarCan't wait to go back on a Sunday or Monday for an all day happy hour.
For a great reasonably-priced hotel very centrally located in Scottsdale Hyatt place ROCKED  I stayed here for work during the week since I have a certain budget to stick to and was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the staff and experience was  They have a small cardio room for a gym but offer a full LA Fitness gym access if you show your room key (highly recommend) The staff is so so helpfulthey go out of their way to show you around make you feel comfortable and it even includes a yummy free continental breakfast  Can't go wrong.
My trip to the Nordstrom Cafe was like everyone else'sI did not know what to expectWalking in I thought it was a restaurant where you get seated but figure out the stand in line cafeteria style type which did not bug me at allI found it kinda cool actuallyWalking down the line there were soooo many different food options and each one looked amazingly goodKudos for the displays the let people see what the dish looks like and how big the portions areI opted for the cranberry turkey sandwich and a soda as well as a Snickerdoodle cookieAfter paying you then get seated by a server and your food gets delivered to youOur server Salvadore was tremendousThe service from him was impeccableHe was super niceMy cranberry turkey sandwich was really really good(I am not exaggerating)It also came with some plain potato chips which were greatMy Dr Pepper was always filled and my cookie was heavenlyThis cafe really blew my mind expecially because it's located in the Nordstrom in the mallI will for sure return to the Nordstrom cafe and I am anxious to try the tomato soup.
I don't do sexy well All of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness Drunk on sake from Nobuo I attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff The Teeter Tots Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce were so good I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now but nothing has come close Now I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure so I gave these guys a shot Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision everGet frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance.
Really good food in a cute setting  I like how the restaurant is set up in little rooms  (It is a house after all)  That makes for a more intimate quieter meal  The omakase dinner was not available the night I went so we ordered off the menu  The hamachi with grapefruit was awesome as were the soft shell shrimp & green papaya slaw (great for snacking with a glass of cold beer)  But the star of the night was definitely the pork belly buns  Finally a creative way to eat pork belly  The soft white buns complemented the fat from the pork belly very well  Parking was actually note that bad since the restaurant offers validation for the parking structure next door  Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food  This is an all-around winner  I can't wait to go back.
There are deals a-plenty at the Peter Piper Pizza during the lunch hour on weekdays at this location  While traveling through the Grand Canyon State and checking out the Ice Den practice home of the Phoenix Coyotes (nee Winnipeg Jets) I stumbled upon this hidden gem in the desert  This is well-kept and clean pizza place  And the deal for all you can eat pizza salad and cinnamon twist with drink cost less than $7  There is a bar here and had the Blue Moon on Tap  Folks for all of your nostalgic needs there is PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) on tap too  Jarrod the restaurant manager served us promptly and efficiently  The pizza was not bad as it hit the spot after watching the Coyotes practice  Beer is served cold with an orange garnish well-cut and placed on top of the foam of the beer  That's cool if it is cut right  Surprising all of the games worked and was surprised that the selection of prizes were pretty good  Lighting was sufficient and there are ample tables and booths available  It was too cold to dine al fresco that day  At this location there was a steady stream for lunch as there are businesses close by the restaurant  This is a place that is great for kids  Even if I don't have any young tykes running around this deal is hard to beat  I shall return.
We have been to the Spotted Donkey near the Bouldrs many times and every time the total experience was woderful especially the consistantly great food  On the other hand we have been to the new Spotted Donkey on Hayden 3 times and all three times the food was practically inedible The food is consistantly dry tastless and usually arrives at the table cold It is a beautiful restaurant but I would highly reccomend avoiding the new one on Hayden.
Service this morning was abysmal I changed locations this morning running late in hopes that the drive-thru would be more speedy Yeah rightThe line moved painstakingly slooooowwwww When I got my coffee it was barely 2/3 full and the rest was all whipped cream I ordered a Venti Vanilla Latte I'm not going to pay five dollars for a cup full of whipped cream I wanted the coffee Last time I visit this location.
I definitely enjoyed staying at The Clarendon This was a quick stop on our road trip but it didn't feel like we missed anything because this hotel seems to be a hot spot in town Lots of locals at the pool and fun people at the bar Definitely an enjoyable and comfortable stay.
I went here for my birthday a few months ago and was completely floored by the taste of the food AmazingI liked that it was a tapas style restaurant because my Dad and his girlfriend don't (usually) have big appetites although my husband and I doWe loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in We ordered some delicious sake And we ordered a little bit of everything I thought the vegetarian selection was decent I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I remember us all ravenously digging into every plate then greedily waiting for the next The flavors were phenomenal We HAD to have more We ordered another round of tapas and sake More gluttony followed My Dad and his girlfriend ate like pigs But even after about a dozen small plates we weren't filledMy only complaint is the huge bill at the end $140 But I do take responsibility for not keeping track of the mounting expense The small plates seem reasonably priced but you need to order enough to get fill your stomach Again we loved the atmosphere I loved the erotic art by the bathroom My Dad scoffed "That's nothing new Same shit I saw in the '60's" Whatever My Dad claims he has already seen everything before at least he was impressed by the foodI will definitely be back And give their happy hour a try to relieve some of the burden off my wallet.
First let me chuckle at the reviews that rate it low because it's busy or loud  FolksREALLY  Seriously you rate this place low because you can't sit right down on a weekend night you have some issues If an empty quiet place is what you are looking for Burger King and Harveys right next door to Blue may be the spot for you Okay first service is always top notch   The servers are great friendly attentive and most importantly  knowledgeable on ALL of the menu items Is the food gourmet  Nope it is a sports bar but personally I have not found a place that compares the quality and taste of the food at this place  I am not kidding there is not one menu item that I have tried that I haven't enjoyed  My personal favorites boneless wings grilled mahi tacos buffalo chicken flat bread pizza and pasta alfredo  This is by far my families and my favorite dinner spot and it seems by the crowds many agree with me.
Granted that they have just opened  However they have several other outlets around town so there is no excuse really  If you are up in the bustier ranges skip this particular location  They advertise that they go up to size 42DD however the selection is pathetic  The young woman who was "helping" us didn't even offer to measure my friend  She just took my friend's word for the size  Now anyone who has ever shopped for a bra knows that different brands will fit differently - and this is supposed to be an upscale joint right  The girl who has "helping" my friend get going to answer the phone and was walking around with a phone to her ear while looking for bras  Not classy  Then when my friend was trying on bras she was off talking to another girl who was plopped on a seat in the back apparently texting to pass the time  I don't know if she was working but she was not a pretty picture  I finally intervened and ASKED THE BOZO CLERK to measure my friend  We went from a 42 D to a 38 D - gee  I finally gave up and just went in with my friend and helped her to fit her bra  There used to be a magic bra fitter at Dillard's in Mesa who taught me everything about fitting a bra - and I thank her today for that  The service was so low-rent  It was not at all what I expected  I have gotten more help at Wal-Mart for crying out loud  The bra ended up costing 35 bucks - not unreasonable - in fact  pretty darned inexpensive as I was expecting more expensive wares  But the whole experience was absolutely the pits  I mentioned this location at my pilates class and as it turned out two other women had similar experiences  One went out to Kirland Commons and said it was a much improved experience  She and I would never waste our time at the Biltmore location  We had to go over to the Hagen Daaz store and gaze at the chocolate to get over this disaster.
This is the OG triple OG Quiktrip The summer this one opened in high school they had free soda FOR THREE MONTHS It was the best summer of my life All Quiktrips dominate all gas stations and convenience stores The staff is always friendly and you never have to wait in line cause they check you out as fast as possible I get kinda anxious cause everyone is moving so freaking fast and it makes me nervous Their donuts are F'n amazing Their Maple Bars are the size of your F'n forearm and melt in your mouth Their deli sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches are great They sell cold 2 liters and 12 packs of soda I would live in a convenience store if I could My wife hates going with me cause I like to walk around looking for new snacks and take my time like I am in Toys R Us or something All Quiktrips are awesome and would pick it over ANY store out there.
Pizza & Hot Wings are EXCELLENT Great service & friendly staff Started going to this location because the one on Warner Ave & Gilbert Rd went to hell on the food & serviceworth driving the extra mile : ).
Best burger I've ever had  How can you go wrong Beef burger with pork belly cooked to perfection with gruyere cheese caramelized onion and baconaise all nestled between a butter bun  Soooo good  My friend had the Drunk chicken crust sandwhich that was equally as delicious  Can't wait to go back for dinner with my hubby.
I am updating my review and taking Five Guys down to one star after my most recent visit I found that they had raised prices yet again and had reduced portion sizes Few things anger me more as a consumer than this double hit in the wallet Burgers appear to be smaller but the fries are noticeably smaller The cups they use to hold the fries are about one third smaller and the "extra" fries they toss in have been cut by half For the burger fries and drink I had the bill was just under $18 I can go to a sports bar I like in Scottsdale and have a selection of sandwiches with plentiful fries a bottomless soft drink and with tip get out of there for less than my Five Guys bill AND have someone serve it to me on a plate Raise prices OR shrink portion but don't do both This tactic offends me and my wallet and I doubt if I will be back.
I love Michael Mina and I love steakhouses - independently of each other  Mr Mina's iteration of the classic steakhouse was superb Cocktails alone occupy their own separate binder (awesome) and BS has the most comprehensive wine list that I encountered while in AZ  I had the 10 oz filet which was pretty close to perfect asparagus and broccolini  The most awesome part of the meal was by far dessert  The beignets should win some kind of award  Waitstaff was lovely as well  Only thing I hated and didn't really understand Decor of the main dining roomit's tragic and confusedBottom line: If you're in Scottsdale you need to experience Bourbon Steak.
My grandmother has a pool that she struggles to maintain all on her own so I took it upon myself to find a reputable pool service company that I could trust to take care of her pool  I found Aqua Shine Pool Services through friends who ensured me that they were 100% trustworthy and very reasonably priced as well  Right off the bat I have nothing but good to say about them they are always on time very respectful of the fact that my grandmother lives alone and send the same technician rather than different people every time  The pool was in really bad shape when they began servicing it and in two weeks it was able to be swam in again  The have always maintained more than just the water condition too If they notice leaks out of joints or caps on the pump they inspect it and either replace gaskets and o-rings or recommend service  I truly believe they know what they are doing and I have no doubts that they will continue to serve her honestly and thoroughly in the years to come.
What a great place Bigger better The Belgian waffles are amazingalway the same wonderful flavor and consistency The staff couldn't be nicerI wish I could eat here every day.
My wife and I were in need of 15 tons of garden soil to fill our six new raised gardens beds We ran a quick search on Craig's List and found a local company named Arizona Rock Depot AZ Rock Depot's co-owner Rex responded to our email inquiry within a few hours with a quoteThe price seemed reasonable enough so we scheduled a delivery for the following Tuesday The delivery was for the 15 tons of garden soil and 7 tons of granite I explained to Rex it was imperative that both loads were on the ground by 8 AM Tuesday as I would have a tractor man there to move the material simultaneously Rex repeated back the delivery schedule and instructions and took my credit card informationThat Thursday my doorbell rang at 6:00 AM It was a driver from AZ Rock Depot with a load of dirt I explained to him that he had been misinformed and that the delivery was to be made on Tuesday four days away He leftTuesday morning came and by 7:00 there was no sign of Az Rock Depot I called Rex' number repeated and left several anxious emails I finally received a text message at 7:15 informing that the truck was just leaving the yard We are less than 30 minutes from his yard At 8:00 I shot back another text asking where the trucks were Rex replies that they were on the way but only one truck was en route The same truck would have to unload Drive back to the yard fill and return I grumbled to Rex that this was not the agreement I needed both materials on the ground at 8 as agreed because my tractor man would have to pull from both piles at the same timeRex snapped back that he would just cancel the delivery then He realized I was in a vulnerable situation with a crew standing by so he decided to go on the attack I informed him that if he left me hanging I would hold him liable for any losses due to breach of contract The threat of a small claims action a BBB complaint and a hit on Yelp didn't deter him Rex was going to teach me a lesson for complaining He turned back the delivery (I doubt it was ever en route anyhow) and left me and my crew hangingI called to lodge a complaint with the local nursery which promotes AZ Rock Depot's products and services The nursery informed me that Rex and his partner were new owners and had just assumed ownership within the past two weeks They apologized profusely for the trouble caused by RexYou would think that a management team who had been at the helm of a company just two weeks would be doing all they could be in order to establish and retain customers They seem intent instead of burning down their new business with incompetent scheduling and an unbridled belligerence towards any customer they failWhy would anyone tolerate such incompetence and poor customer service with so many reputable companies around We scrambled to find another company who had both loads on the ground within 45 minutes.
Heck yay All the reviews below are spot on but I'll throw my two cents in I had the lunch special (Magic Mushroom Burger) and ordered my son a basic cheeseburger We both chowed down Fries were a bit salty but the burgers were bestest And the $5 lunch special is toppermostThe counter guys even had little airplanes for my kids to play with while we waited for our order We sat on the back porch out of the sun and had a great lunch Will visit again when I'm around.
Has potential but 110db (about as loud as a jet taking off)  headbanger music chosen by a 15 year old and very poorly prepared food make this non-Mexican food joint hard to recommend  Avoid this restaurant.
Best Mexican food in old town for sure Loves this place and the authenticity Felt like I was on vacation.
I have been referred to go here by 3 different people and I finally went today  Wow This place is awesome  Yes it is crowded but it didn't bother me a bit  It was actually a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend oohing and aahing at all the choices and the ridiculously low prices  It seems like everything was under a dollar or maybe just over I got 3 heavy bags full of stuff for $15 which included quite a few things that are pricey in the regular grocery stores this time of year  I'm definitely now inspired to cook up something good from my fully stocked fridge.
Epic win My husband and I stumbled into this restaurant wanting to try out something new We were blown away by the large selection the great service and delicious food This place quickly became a favorite and we will definitely be visiting more often After all there are so many more menu items to try.
I won't rave on and on as you have probably already read everything that I am going to say This place is awesome The french toast sausage and (drum roll please)the carne adovada are among my favorite dishes The bloody marys are great too They actually come with a side of beer This place is hard to find Just look for the hardware store in the the plaza and it will be directly to the left of it and to the right of Luci's.
This is such a great addition to Sky Harbor  I normally park at one of the off-site locations but decided to check out the Sky Train on my last trip  I had to check a bag so I pulled up to the curbside bag check (which to use you must arrive at least 90 minutes before your flight) and checked my bag with ease  That is a fantastic feature  It currently only serves those flying Southwest or US Airways  I parked in one of the garages took the elevator down to the ground level and then took the escalator up to the train platform  The trains run every few minutes so my wait was less than 5 minutes  The short trip drops you off in the middle of Gate level at Terminal 4  Very convenient.
Welcome to the desert Portillo's Everyone from Chi-Town is in hot dog heaven.
This place was amazing I was traveling home from San Francisco and a traveler I met suggested this place to me because it was their favorite Thai place I went the night I got back into town and it did not disappoint Very tasty with a great portion Staff was very helpful and accommodating I got massaman curry and it was delicious.
I work in the same dying business park as AGE in Phoenix Walked over said i need a new windshield Curtis gave me a quote Called them a week later best price in town next day FIVE STAR installation no gimmicks excellent service is what they do I have had a few windshields replaced and this was by far the fastest cleanest and top notch install The last guy did not do a very good job replacing the molding on the windshield and i thought i wood have to buy new moldings nope dood was able to fit them in perfectly and looks excellentThis company really is Auto Glass EXCELLENCE.
Oh Table Tops how I love thee If I could write a love note to Table Tops I would They are my favorite wedding vendor of all times You know the saying you pay for what you get Well Table Tops was worth every penny and probably more I am truly going to miss working with them on the wedding planning First I will start with the dear owner Melissa Melissa is a life-saver She knows how to deal with confused brides so very well She knows flowers like the back of her hand and she can pick out a type of flower from a scattered description (umm I think they are white and tiny and typically very bridal looking" Yes Melissa knew the flower based on that description) She is incredibly knowledgeable fun and truly makes a wedding into a beautiful day Table Tops knows quality they know service and they know execution They are like little flower fairies on the day of the wedding They come in create a fairytale wonderland with their floral and decor (if you hire them for decor) and then they leave before you even realize they were there in the first place The quality of their flowers is impeccable and they truly create an atmosphere I had some detailed ideas for my bouquet and Melissa created exactly what I wanted I wanted my bouquet to look vintage chic with my antique family buttons placed throughout it I wanted my wedding dress lace to hold the stem together and I wanted rosary beads hanging from the bouquet She did it By golly she did it and it looks beautiful The saddest part about beautiful wedding flowers is that they only last a day so make sure you take a lot of pictures of Table Tops' workOn another note I would like to share one more story about Table Tops genuine and kind nature On the day of the wedding I showed up to the church and there was a little bit of drama with the management there While trying to get it worked out I was standing alone in the prep room and no one was there to help me with my veil or very long train At that moment one of the Table Top staff who had been in charge of setting up the church flowers introduced herself to me I was a little nervous and flustered and mentioned my concern about my veil and train Without another word she so very kindly fixed both and then stood there and held them for me until I walked down the aisle For that I will be forever grateful to Table Top Not only are their services and talent impeccable but the staff itself is incredibly kind and heartfelt.
Best Mongolian BBQ I've ever had anywhere hands down There's also a full bar and sake bombers Had to go rub one off in the bathroom due to my massive food chubbyOOM NOM NOM NOM NOM FAP FAP FAP FAP FAPWill repeat soon.
Noisy  Poorly sound proofed rooms means that every car with booming stereos outside you have to listen to  I have never had this noisy of a hotel room  Even worse some family upstairs appeared to be practicing tap dancing based on the racket they were making  No wi fi in the rooms you have to use wired Internet accessHaving the Arizona Mills shopping center across the street was handy for xmas shopping  The free breakfast was good.
Can't even bother to elaborate Batting cages are horrible nuff said look out in the baseball ones as they throw pretty crazy and the softball lanes are pretty non-accurate nor are they consistent  The balls are really hard so don't bring a bat you wanna not crackThe karts are shitty even for lame little kid karts Food is super gross didn't play minigolf or gamesPretty lame for a "fun" place.
I absolutely love this location at Serranos Their customer service is amazing The layout of this restaurant is very unique and gives you many options of tables to sit at depending on how you feel I am obsessed with the chips they deliver at the beginning of your meal The chips come with salsa and bean dip which are to die for Their margaritas are amazing and you can not come here without trying one I have yet to try an item on the menu I do not like.
Service was great the place was kept really neat and clean And the food is authentic Great place to eat after a hangover or lunch.
This place is awesome Better than the traditional fast Hawaiian foodThis place I'd say is very authentic with huge portions  It's inexpensive great quality/fresh and a huge portion  A must try if you are craving Hawaiian food.
The staff here is simply amazing Kelly at the front desk and Jillian went above and beyond the call of duty helping me with a request I really appreciated their help Thank you.
Brady's fat ass is finally right about somthing The pulled pork is amazing the sweet and smokey sauce is not as good as the hot and sweet though I recommend asking for the hot and sweet sauce on the pulled pork but honestly you can't go wrong iether way.
Yes this pizza really is as good as it gets The flavors and the dough are epic Service is friendly They serve lunch now so there is no need to wait in the long dinner lines.
Great sushi place Went with some out of town friendsThey were hesitant at first because they didn't relate Phoenix with good sushiThey left happy and with changed mindsWe shared several rolls the names escape me nowI love their iced green tea It actually had flavor the best green tea I ever hadI will return here soon with my local sushi eaters.
This place is the bombbest place to hangout awesome mix drink coffee and the service is the best.
OMG As an unofficial wing connoisseur BWW was the front runner - not any more people  I ordered via their app for take out - yes their app which is SUPER convenient and my order was waiting for me when I got there  Their wings are Atkins friendly and most of their sauces too  Thier wing prices are also less than BWW  Mmm Hmm So we ordered the 30 wing count with 3 different sauces 2 orders of celery only and 2 orders of blue cheese  The sauces were really good - the cajun - buttery spicey goodness  Totally cravable  Their blue cheese dipping sauce REAL blue cheese and NOT runny watery grossness  Ya know sometimes it's the little things that make me HAPPY  They have many sizes of wings especially if you want to get some for a party  They are also known for their yeast rolls which I've had pre-atkins and those are heavenly  Wingstop is our new go to for wing cravings.
My typical dish of choice is Orange Chicken with Fried Rice  It's AMAZING  I wish I could afford to eat every meal thereI no longer live in Laveen but I will be travelling back to Laveen (and who wants to do that) just to have lunch/dinner at my favorite chinese place in PhoenixYUMMY.
I love Pete's I know I know - you eat outside you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash I love the food anyway I've gone to Pete's since I was born I love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it I only wish they would expand north I'm addicted to Pete's.
After being in Texas for the past few months coming back here flooded my tongue with so many great memories The egg rolls were pure bliss just as i remembered The vermicelli with beef and shrimp paste was very good They never cease to amaze me.
Unique environment Good food (meatball and brisket sliders) and lemonade cocktails on a sunny fall afternoon.
So good Couldn't rate it anything less than 5*.
The food here is amazing Everything I have had has been great Burgers breakfast huge sandwiches It can get really busy but is always worth the wait Quality food and good service.
I read the reviews and tried the pulled pork and chicken with the hot n sweet bbq sauce and was impressed I usually don't go to bbq joints because I leave feeling I could have had better at home  Customer service was good too Plus beer was $2 Ill definitely come back.
I have only had good experiences at this location  I went once in the morning with a scheduled appointment for an extensive fasting blood draw  I waited fewer than five minutes in the waiting room and was happy to have a friendly professional tech do my blood draw  There were quite a few people in the waiting room clearly mornings are busy for fasting draws  Just make an appointment and you shouldn't have a problem  I just went again this afternoon for a simple blood draw  I didn't make an appointment just walked in around 3:45 in the afternoon  There were only three people in the waiting room  I got a different tech he was also friendly and professional  I was out the door in under ten minutes  Both times the techs found my vein on the first try with no trouble  Can't ask for much more than friendly staff and quick efficient service.
Came here 6pm almost every table taken up no seats at bar Ordered dolmathes and calamari which were reeeeally good I've been to their Goodyear location for their gyro which compared to others found in west valley is A++ Service was really good too always checked on Will come back and highly recommend.
Great ambience friendly staff Cincy style chili and homemade rootbeer floats.
This is my favorite bar in North Phoenix There are tons of TVs perfect for football season if you want to watch multiple games There is an OTB not really my thing but pretty cool anyhow There are pool tables and dart boards and a little claw machineThe restaurant is very open There are places to sit at tables or booths a bar off to the left and nice seating on the patio The best part though the food I frickin love their food So many great things to choose from and they have a large menu selection Some of my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich nachos (they make their own cheese sauce) and the burgers My absolute favorite is the bacon cheese fries (sub seasoned waffle fries for regular) You are in a serious carb coma after eating them but whatevs they are too good to even care The staff is always consistently friendly and on point I really do love it here and am super happy it's so close to home.
The Poisoned Pen has been a local favorite for quite a long time as the last time I was actually in the store was in the '90s to get a book signed by Sue Grafton  I went here again recently to browse their selections and was happy to see that despite the invention of electronic books and media they are still here to please those that prefer turning paper pages to scrolling on a LCD screen  There is a wide selection of books to choose from including some very charming children's books in addition to their extensive mystery collections.
went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants) and we decided we wanted to have a nice sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night  Eddie's House fit the bill perfectlyFood - excellent  Tuna Tartar "nachos" were great  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked  Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before  they were excellent  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent  Service - excellent  very nice waiter who was very attentiveLocation - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path  Atmosphere - also excellentPrices - being from San Francisco the prices were unbelievably reasonable.
We have been looking for a good Asian style restaurant that fit our needs since we have moved to AZ We heard about Asian Island through a friend and we decided to try it The not only had all our favorites but the prices were reasonable and all the food was very fresh Everyone was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable I would recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food I will definitely eat at Asian Island again.
If you're a party of two Davanti isn't really "tapas" it's bigger That being said I shared five plates with my date We couldn't finish dessert which is saying something (and by "something" I mean I went into a cheese coma post-meal)Go with a larger party to taste more dishes without accidentally eating to the point of no return after only ordering a fewWe started with the cannellini bean vasi The spread was creamy smoky and studded with purple onion A stack of really crunchy toasts drizzled with olive oil were served on the side The oil seemed like overkill but it didn't subtract from the dish so all is forgiven Next up was the most significant thing that happened to my tastebuds/me in general all week Enter truffle egg toast Soft yolk fontina truffle asparagus This plate was definitely smaller than the rest but it was exceptionally rich and complex I'm ordering this for myself and stabbing anyone who tries to "share" with my fork next time We went for the homemade ricotta gnocchi afterwards which was a great mix - eggplant tomato garlic and fresh melty mozzarella The ricotta gave the dumplings a slightly fluffier texture but it wasn't a huge deviation from the standard Overall the mozzarella definitely made the dishLast but most dessert First up the goat cheesecake was crustless topped with caramel and almond brittle It had a very light texture and musky rich flavor which needed the sweet contrast of the caramel and brittle The almond brittle added a lot and in the future I'd ask for extra The Purple Pig was two slices of super crunchy grilled bread with a dollop of Nutella homemade marshmallow fluff and bananas in the center Simple delicious and passable as lunch Maybe It's worth a shotEveryone was attentive and happy to answer questions but they wore basketball shorts were covered in tats and piercings and just were not givin' a sh*t about their presentation At an upscale restaurant it was a refreshing twist that made Davanti feel far from uptight 'Twas unconventional but thoroughly enjoyable much like everything else I'll definitely be back in the market for some of that again soon.
Amazing  Super friendly and they literally let me try 10 flavors  Service was great too they bring you water and are super friendly  Check it out.
It's a little pricey but it is definitely worth it I love this restaurant The atmosphere is amazing I always feel like I'm on a nice date even when I go with my mom I like to get the dinners because you get a really nice selection of different dishes Their tandoori is also amazing its not super dry like most places Try anything you like and you won't be disappointed Get it as spicy as you can standThey also have extensive vegetarian options Extensive delicious optionsI recommend this place wholeheartedly.
Ahh I went here one day and took a whole 2 hours to go back again This place was great I found curtains for my house for a whopping 12 bucks (for both panels) And books games the whole shebang Yeah I agree with Jessica on wanting to save this little secret of mine but man oh man I spent so many hours at antique stores and totally neglected the real deal Definitely recommended or not recommended if you're going for any size 6s.
The other day a friend said "If you like buffets you've got to try Golden Corral"  I said "But it's clear over past 75th Avenue half way to LA"  He said "If you don't think it's great I'll pay you back for your gas"  Move over Hometown here comes Golden Corral  This place rocks with a huge selection of delicious goodies including things you've never even seen at a restaurant before (Brussels sprouts  Don't like 'em  That's because you haven't tasted THEEEESE Brussels sprouts)  Grab your keys.
This is my favorite lunch spot in AZI don't care if its a 115 outside i still go in and dominate the phoits the best pho i've had and the staff is great.
This place is worth checking out So good I usually get the chicken pho But everything is great The staff is super friendly as well I've tried other places for pho but always compare it to Tea Lite Cafe's Hard for me to go anywhere else.
I really fucking hate places like Lone Star As you can tell from the name the cheap gimmicky theme here is "Texas" You have stupid waitresses walking around with cowboy hats and t-shirts that say "Don't Mess with Texas" and who are instructed to say "Howdy y'all" when you walk in The food is a notch above Burger King if that The decor is the same shit they plaster over every other restaurant of this genre but with slight variations for Greek (My Big Fat Greek Restaurant) Mexican (Macayo's) and Just Plain Stupid-Ass (TGI Friday's) So yeah this is basically the Texas equivalent of TGI Fridays Does that appeal to you Does it turn you on Then please go there eat your stupid generic burger/burrito/gyro/chicken tenders and leave me the hell alone Just please please I beg you never force me to come here again the way you did today.
Don't bother stopping here Stopped in at 10am on a Tuesday and was turned away They told me their "system was down" and it would be a half hour before they could do any oil changes So I drove 1/2 mile east and went to Steel Image Oil and Lube and not only did they change the oil but they did a free car wash in less than 15 minutes.
Tried many different methods to deal with my back pain and other pain issues Saw chiropractors massage therapists in the USA Austria Syria Germany Libya and even tried the ones at airports hoping it would help a little Several thousand dollars later I met Daniel He explained his method to me (medical massage) and I was a bit skeptical about the promised results Oh boy was I way off and was he correct Daniel helped me while all others did a lot of talking without delivering I haven't felt that well for over a decade I would recommend him any day and cannot wait for my next appointment with him He takes his sweet time to do it right and proper shows that he really cares which is hard to find anywhere in the world Sounds exaggerated It is not I do not give testimonials it really is not my thing at all but in this case I am delighted to do so.
Oh Fez  Thank you for being one of my go to places I adore the way you always  provide the best food and super service I have to say when I picked up my oldest girls at the airport and they looked starving  I knew what to give them --FEZ   We love the sweet potato fires and given them the honor of "best sweet potato fries in the world"  We also loved our waiter Brandon who made us feel like family and even went out of his way to find a food item not on the menu  for the youngest daughterWay to go Brandon --We loved the great service.
I went to Salt River 3 times this year for Spring Training games Each was a blast since I am a huge baseball fan I was pleasantly surprised that they had such a variety of food and drinks (Jack Daniels Sangria Mike's Hard Lemonade BEER need I say more) not to mention desserts The thing that sent this place over the top was the lawn area- particularly by the Salty Senorita stand- it was a party each time All in all Salt River Fields made this an unforgettable experience for the crowd and honestly made the boys in the baseball pants look a little hotter-as if that was even possible.
I went to this place a couple days ago to have my kids flats fix  The guy at the front seemed nice and professional (at the beginning) one I approach him with my request he stopped me and ask me "did you put fix-a-flat in the tires" I explain to him that my kids had in fact added some into the tires for a quick fix He then said "get these things out of here I will not touch them or let any of my staff work on your bikes" I asked him why He said that "fix-a-flat" was EXTREMELY toxic and will burn trough his clothes and his hands if he was to touch it  After a few more minutes of trying to understand the bull shit this guy was telling me he grabbed one of the bikes and took it outside him self Very disappointed and I will never recommend anyone to go here for any kind of reason Save the haste and drive the extra 10minutes to the BIKE BARN 36th st and Indian School rd.
Is it cheap  Yes  Are the chips fresh and the salsas free  Yes and yes  Is the food delicious  YeeeeesssssWhenever I'm back in Arizona I hit up Rosa's for some authentic Baja deliciousness  Their Baja platter with fish and shrimp tacos is my go-to staple but their chimichongas and enchiladas are also great(Oh I also forgot  Are their beans addictive  Yes).
This is the 2nd such Hibachi Grill I have tried in as many weeks Food was less than tasty and much more limited choices than the one at Metro Mall by Black Angus This one was a lot less clean but the biggest difference was the variety and amount of selections The one at Metro Mall had at least 14 tables of food whereas the Arrowhead (Glendale) one had only 8 That makes a big difference In addition the food at Arrowhead was much less tasteless The cuts of "Prime Rib" appeared to have been there since they opened and looked more like pot roast The cost was only $799 per person (dinner not lunch) but in my opinion $599 would have been overpriced for the quality of the food I will go back to the one at Metro Mall and gladly pay the $999 per person for a much higher quality food and many more choices.
I love how friendly the staff is at Woof They always do a great job cutting my dogs long shaggy hair and she smells so good for the next couple of days A very clean cute place.
Came into town with a group if friends and met up for a brunch OMG  This is great food in a very unique setting The history if this place is just very coolall the buildings in this small area are quaint   Ok back to the foodI love pancakes so I had to give them a try and they did not disappoint  The very gracious owner offered a sample of the apple cinnamon sauce that is nothing short of amazing  It was great on the cakes but even fantastic with bacon  Love itEveryone in our party enjoyed a wonderful meal and was impressed by all  This is a must to return to when back in the area If you come here and don't like it then you certainly have some messed up taste buds.
We are big fans of OTFMWe had been going to the Phoenix Downtown Market on Saturdays for a year + now & love it It's just a bit of a hike for us We also participated in Maya's Farm's CSA the last go around & have been missing our market visitsWell we've been going religiously to OTFM now for some time & pretty much cannot miss itIt just continues to get better & better (and more & more crowded)McClendon Farms has a big spread there & the produce is awesome They have enough variety that we don't even have to supplement produce purchases with supermarket visits at allMy other favorite thing about OTFM is that they have GREAT foodHighlights for me:-Payton Curry is typically there (some representative of Digestif always is) & has killer dishes We've had awesome chili wonderful frittatas & even fresh hand pulled mozzarella with bagna cauda (which is probably our new favorite find of the past several months)-Tracey Dempsey (desert genius of assorted Kasperski spots) is there & has wonderful creations She typically has a great offering from Cowboy Ciao as well-Chrysa Kaufman & Rancho Pinot are there showcasing McClendon produce Whatever they have flat out rocks I've had amazing sandwiches there every time unbelievable bean & sausage soup & about 50 glasses of meyer lemonade (the kids help)The other absolute must for us is the bread by the Phoenician folks They have a chocolate cherry sourdough which is insane Pairs wonderfully with red wine & coffee (so it's easy to do twice in a day) Their other breads are awesome tooThat's enough for me to already be a win I absolutely love that the chefs of some of the great local independent spots were there chatting & interacting with the community Makes me doubly want to patronize their restaurants It seems as if the chefs are pairing up with local farms as wellOther faves: -The tamale folks from Downtown Market are there with their excellent product Unfortunately they don't focus much on food sales on the spot but more on frozen packets for home  We love their tamales (especially their chicken/mole)-There is a hot dog stand using Vienna Beef & doing Chicago style dogs with sport peppers celery salt & all Food is good but be prepared to wait-There is also an interesting looking huge BBQ smoker which I need to try Heard it was great from some folks we talked to-Maya's Farm is there Produce looked great-There was an interesting vegan desert stall which was quite yummy that we'll be checking out more closely as well (dairy/egg allergic kids)-Several artisan bread stallsAnd throughout the day they also have live music which gives it a nice vibeWas bummed Tortillas Rosario isn't there any longer Hopefully they'll return as they were there early on Excited that Seacat Gardens will also be coming back soonHave also heard Sweet Republic will have a presence soon which we'll be totall psyched forFresh eggs are scarce We've been too late but have heard that Maya & the goat lady have eggs Definitely something that they need more ofThey also do the write your order down on a card & go pay at a central location type thing like Downtown Phoenix Market as well but there are a couple vendors who only take cashIf you need it there is an ATM just north of 1st street on Brown (west side of the street) - I needed itAnyway for us it's by far our favorite farmers market in town.
Simply the best breakfast Delicious creamy pancakes and the best eggs benedict I've ever had California bacon benedict with a side of fresh fruit and hashbrowns and a fresh bottomless cup of coffee yum No matter how busy this place gets we always get great friendly and fast service Have to still try their delicious looking personal pies and bread pudding.
Best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been every plate is awesome Best Pho I come to this restaurant at least twice at month  30 miles drive from were I live to get there all worth it .
Cinnamon Carmel Buns are one of my favorite things to eat in the valley  Love getting them at the Tammie Coe booth at Vincents on Saturday  I regular get the english muffins for breakfast and cupcakes for special occasions at home.
I can't believe I haven't rated this before  LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here  Kool-aid on tap   NOM  I do have to say that I don't eat wings but my bf does EVERYWHERE and this is one of his faves  His 7 year old said they have the best food she's had anywhere  She is a picky little princess tooI get to nosh on all of the other deliciousness they offer try them all  We will be back again and again and again.
This might be an odd review because I didn't actually go on a ride with them but I want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service  Long story short I work in media as does my wife and we each did a story with them  They were very helpful and the customers I spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them  That's part one  I was SO impressed I bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife  We had bad luck such as super high winds (cancelled) and emergency surgery ( cancelled) then I had a job transfer out of the area  We were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and I just want to thank them  A solid group and businessif something goes awry I feel confident they will work with you  That's it.
Yet another example of a restaurant chain that has been crapped out of the back end of corporate America  I went to this place because a couple of friends preppy white boring friends recommended it  I should have known I would hate it  First I walk in thinking it would at least be sit down but no it's a fast food  You have to go to the counter  I guess the new terminology that folks are using in order to convince white yuppies with money is 'fast casual'  Not fast food - fast casual  I guess the difference is that they bring the food to your table  Well isn't that a fancy cup of hot teaAnd then there's the menu which bring up the question  What do you get when you cross a Panda Express with another Panda Express  You get this craphole called Pei Wei at twice the price  And how do you pronounce it  PeeWee  Is that supposed to be cute  Hello Kitty meet average corporate Asian dumpBut what bugs me the most is I saw what type of clientele this place attracted  The same folks who would scream at forking over an extra buck at a locally owned Asian restaurant are giving away the bank for bland typical run of the mill food that you could find at your local Dennys  White people just piss me off and I can say that because I'm white  You didn't see Asians in there  You didn't see any Latinos and you certainly didn't see any Black folk  All you saw were a bunch of white preptards that would fit in nicely at a Jeff Foxworthy concert  "You know your a redneck when you eat at Pei Wei Asian dinner and you really think you are getting a taste of real Asian culture  Hell yeah"I know how you are thinking that you are going to teach your kids what real Asians eat and in a environment that is true to the Asian culture and you'll show your little snot head kids how to eat with chopsticks so they can learn to become the brain dead pretentious adults that their parents have become but in fact they know just as much about true culture as a plastic forkWell that's how I saw the whole thing  Parking was good.
Relatively unknown but everything there is amazing Everyone that works there is so friendly too Try the cinnamon and sugar bagel Awesome.
Good food Horrible service  They need to have an intervention with a Dr of Customer Service  Management please step it up help your staff be considerate and respectful  No matter how good the food is if I receive horrible service more than once you get one star.
My husband and I are giving this market no stars for racism received at the bakery We waited and waited for the girl to help us and she clearly saw my husband waiting yet didn't even acknowledge his presence Not even a "go F yourself"So he got her attention and was asking about the tres leches cakes She replied "huh" "huh" "huh" every time he opened his mouth He spoke better English than her If you don't have brown skin expect to be treated like a 2nd class citizen Actually my husband has brown skin but he is from the ME funny that she treated him like that you would think she would be more understandingIf you read other YELPers you will see we weren't the only ones treated like crapBy the way the tres leches cake sucked.
Another great shop This coffee shop is right in the heart of OT Scottsdale The coffee is strong service is great and the environment makes for a productive work session Check it out.
The sandwiches here are fresh tasty and cheap The Baguettes are made on site and you notice it The sliced peppers in the sandwiches are a bit spicy but that makes them better in my opinionThis is a place for a quick bit It feels a bit industrial noisy and busy However they seem to be very efficient and the restaurant is extremely clean It is cash only but that shouldn't be a problem since the prices are so cheapAlso try the spring rolls mniam mniam.
Love this place I only shop here and at the Asian or Mexican markets.
Outstanding the butternut squash ravioli and grouper clams and scallops simply the best meal we have had in quite awhile.
The best Vietnamese food in Chandlertremendous Seafood Pho Seafood Rice Soup is pretty amazing as well  Huge portions and amazingly reasonable pricesgo for the food it's greattolerate the incredibly average strip mall setting.
A Great evening on Portland's patio with friends enjoying the best burgers and wines ever Tonight was a Champion Burger w/parmesan fries - Awesome.
Props to Applebee's on 27th and Bell I went there for the free Veteran's meal It was packed but they got me in at the bar right away and had my meal in front of me within 10 minutes The whole time Courtney and Kara did an awesome job taking care of us all at the bar Really great customer service.
I'm very picky on who touches my hair I fully trust her with my hair  I'm the kind of girl who has no idea What she wants and just expects the stylist to read my mind Jessica works with me and helps me articulate what I picture in my head  She is amazing.
Hands down I just ate the best bagel I've ever tasted I enjoy lox so much that I buy the Philadelphia cream cheese with salmon in it because it's the closest substitute I can afford on a regular basisI've had good lox in New Orleans but I really haven't been thrilled with the bagels I've had here That changed however upon my first visit to NY Bagels and DeliThere was a constant flow of patrons and the wait was negligible The place is clean and the tv (bonus pts for having ESPN on) was without volume keeping the noise level appropriate They had almost every kind of bagel in stock including blueberry jalapeno spinach and the standards like everything sesame salt etc I chose the Nova on an onion bagel which is smoked salmon cream cheese capers red onions and tomato The salmon portion was very generous for a $7 breakfast I don't mind paying that much for a sandwich that doesn't skimp on quality ingredients As others stated the bagel has a great crispy exterior and fabulous fluffy interior I highly recommend this place if you're on the north side of Phoenix.
Well I have lived here for almost 3 years now and I had just visited Del Sol in both Jamaica and Cozumel on a recent cruise just 3 weeks agoso Imagine my shock when I discovered there was a Del Sol right here in Old Town Scottsdale It was very exciting because it was Small business Saturday on November 24th of this year and we were looking to use our AMEX to earn a 25 dollar credit on a 25 dollar purchase So after searching the AMEX site to see if Del Sol was on the list of participating small business' BEHOLD it was and I was off to shop at the world's only store with clothing that changes color when exposed to sunlight That's right if you have not heard of this store or this awesome technology you need to pay a visit to this locale ASAP Del Sol is known all over the world for being the ONLY store with clothing that has designs on them that when exposed to sunlight they immediately change color and the colors are stunning let me tell you Apparently this technology was developed by the Military and Del Sol managed to get a contract to be the ONLY retailer to use and sell this kind of productI bought a muscle shirt and my wife a couple of hair clips on the day we visited this locale The staff was extremely nice and professionalthere are machines in the store that generate sunlight so you can see what colors your items will turn into before you even buy them Everythingand I do mean everythingfrom shirtsskirtstopbottomsjewelrytrinketskey chainsblousesetcchange colorit is extremely awesome When I was in Jamaica I bought some short pants/swimming trunks along with some shirts I have to tell you the trunks were awesome because not only do they change color when your swimming in themthey dry in about 15 minutes and you can walk around in them all day without changing Now be advised things here are not cheapbut they are not expensive eithermake sure you look for the good dealsevery store is a little different I can guarantee one thing it will be the coolest item you will buy if your on vacation BAR NONE When you return home and show it off everyone will want to know where you got itbe sure to tell the Del Sol and as usual Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.
My son and grandson tried out the wave pool recently and loved it It was indoors so no sunburn to worry about and had lifeguards standing guard all around They enjoyed the waves and waterslide both As an added bonus my very active 8 year old grandson (who was staying with us) was a tired out boy by the end of his swimming time :) A must visit for anyone wishing to wave swim without sitting in the beating sun Oh and the kids come home tired - yea.
I went to TOCA for major foot pain I waited a long time to see the Dr so when I did they took X-ray of my foot the DR came in and said I had some problm with my foot the reason he said is bc I was old am only 44 but he was only in the room for less than 4 mins threw me some pills to take and told me to go to PT he never even introduce him self not did he ask what has been going on with my foot this place is the worse I have been to I think I will find a new foot Dr bc I still have foot pain this was TOCA in Mesa and I was a new client so why would I go back and spend money when a dr can't even tell u why this happened to my foot other than u r old.
Haven't been to Roy's in years and what was i thinking  It was sooo good  We went for restaurant week but added on some items  Started with their speciality Hawaiian Martini very pineapple good but liked the wine list and the choices more  We had the calamari as an extra app before we did the pre-fix menu  YUM  Then had the scallops so good but very small maybe b/c of the restaurant week special  My mom had the tomato and aspargus simple but good  i then had the petite fliet cooked to perfection  Mom had the trout said it was great  She kept thinking it was Salmon thoughi stole some of her cous-cous sooo good  We finished with the flourless chocolate cake  So rich but so good  I bet if i could have the ice cream with it it wouldn't be so rich but who cares  Over all a GREAT meal  Mom said best she had all restaurant week.
Delicious Simple gourmet fresh fare Menu is different everytime I've been there (except for the one dessert they offer on their lunch menu) One of my favorite lunch spotsNOW CALLED FnB Same place same owner different name.
Okay it is UNBELIEVABLE how much I am in love with this restaurant I was introduced by a friend last year and now I go every chance I get I live in north phx so green is a little further away from me but it is totally worth the drive I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian I used to miss meat but after I found Green I stopped having a craving to eat meat Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had My best friend is a full on meat lover but one day I made her come with me to Green She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian this is a must tryoh and a little side note the service is so amazing The employees are so nice and caring You can tell they really love their job Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food.
Very rare to find a place where everything on the menu looks goodThis place is a breath of fresh airit's been a while since a restaurant in Phoenix has really impressed me (Although this is technically in Scottsdale haha) I'm not kidding EVERYTHING on the menu looked delish I finally settled on the Orrechiette a handmade pasta with fennel sausage broccoli rabe and local chiliesit was DIVINEthe best Italian  I've had since Arrivederci in San Diego (see previous review) They even make everything fresh to order (so my dairy allergy was not a problem) My husband had the pork shankit was absolutely falling off the bone just mouth watering delicious The flavors had just soaked all the way through the meat totally an insane dish My friend had the Salmon salad again her fish was cooked to perfection no fishy-ness whatsoeverOur server was extremely nice  (a little nervous it seemed but nice) We CANNOT wait to come back and try their Four Square deal - from 4-6 you can get 1 free appetizer and 1 dessert with the purchase of 2 entréesnot bad right.
I hate scorpions Hate them But I live in AZ so I'm bound to encounter the evil creatures however more than 15 inside my house were 15 too many I have 3 young children and I was terrified for them I had another company (Ky-Ko) come to seal our house and I won't bore you with the details but in short:  They didn't sealed every thing as detailed in their 25 point check list  incredibly poor work on what they actually sealed plus cheap materials and bad customer service Excuses and more excusesNot wanting to deal with them anymore and desperate I called SOS They came today and I'm so impressed They sealed my doors perfectly they resealed my vents  (previously sealed with duct tape Really) sealed every nook and cranny  they even changed light bulbs for meThey were extremely professional and knowledgeable about anything scorpions Mike Bill Mike Kyle and I forgot the other guy's name (sorry) were all a pleasure to have in my house They recommend pest control spraying regimens either a company or if you want to DIYThey may be a little more expensive than other companies but they are worth every single penny and moreI can sleep better now.
Customer Service over the phone was very excellent BUUUUTTTTTTTTT i waited an hour and still didnt get my food I ordered at 7:15 and they didnt arrive till 9:02 I was very upset i turned them away I wasn't hungry anymore.
Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city  My bf and I go all the time for brunch and they also have really good burgers too  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunchAH-MAZING.
I ordered a mixed drink Bartender grabs a glass fills it 3/4 of the way with ice pours in alcohol and soda just until the ice starts to float and then grabs the ice scooper and adds MORE ICE TO MY GLASSThis place blows.
This place has great food and the service is amazing I never have to ask for a thing  Its like they are reading my mind  Everything is good from the sweet and sour chicken to the appetizers.
WOW  What more can I say   I love this store  Talk about variety  I could spend hours just wandering the isles contemplating different things to make and the seafood section in the back well let's just say this is the only place I go to get my seafood  Prices are very reasonable and service is very good  Just be patient with some of the staff when it comes to communicating as they are not all fluent in English  But they make every effort to assist you and make your shopping experience a pleasant one  If you have never been and plan on going  Make sure you free up enough time to actually go through the entire store and see all the things they have.
Worst gym I've ever went to The staff is always trying to sell you stuff and the equipment isn't maintained very well IMO I cancelled my membership after 7 months and started going to 24 hour fitness up the road I also had multiple problems with the billing because they always seemed to double charge on the kids club.
Great food friendly employees.
Added bonus: Get the scones early (before 7am) and they are still warm Yummm.
I've been cutting my hair here for more than a year already every two weeks  I was a bit skeptical about going here to get a fade but ended up with a pretty good hair cut for cheap  My usual haircut is a 3 at the top and 0 on the sides with a medium high fade  Two barbers I highly suggest you go to that does an awesome job is Maria and Malorie If you end up going to this place a lot or any other Great Clips Take advantage of the current special which is buying pre-paid haircuts for $999  They recently raised their regular hair cuts from $12 to $13 not too long ago.
excellent home cooking German food Friendly and welcoming atmosphere Went on a Tuesday evening only wated 2 or 3 minutes for a table We drove from Scottsdale just to eat here and will deffinatly be back.
3 years ago Chef Johnny Chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the Valley of the Sun If you're unfamiliar with Chef Chu he's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown Phoenix Asian tapas joint Sens Now his dream is realized with the opening of Tien Wong Hot Pot Surprisingly his new restaurant isn't even located in downtown Phoenix but in the city of Chandler After talking with Chef Chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept in an Asian neighborhood Low rent and a discerning customer base he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring Tien Wong to downtown in the futureFor many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us forget that The idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths Each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed and then you order as many different raw meats seafood vegetables and noodles as you desire Once our order started showing up I become overwhelmed and confused where do you start What are the cooking times What do I do Before allowing my head to explode I simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid In my calamity I didn't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card However it goes something like this the broth boils you drop in the thinly sliced meats pull out dip into one of 2 sauces sesame and soy then eat easy After only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that's designed for socializing romance and lingering If you have difficulty choosing your broth opt for the Ying Yang Broth ($595) which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors I've tried Starting with pork stock the addition of dried dates ginseng Schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth Over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoymentNot to be confused with the tips of peas Pea Tips ($4) actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself The tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw By contrast the Korean Pumpkin ($3) takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skinNoodles include springy Udon ($3) as well as a Flat Rice Noodle ($3) which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense Both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor Sliced Wagyu Beef ($8) comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world So its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender Add an order of Lobster ($9) if available for a surf and turf combo Names aren't always accurate descriptions take Sliced Black Pork ($4) which isn't black at all the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin It's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing Desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake Strawberry ($6) and Green Tea ($6) both were light and satisfying the perfect ending to Chef Chu's dream.
Nostalgic trip down memory lane We went there early June of last year for 5 days Beautiful upscale resort with gorgeous landscape Having a daily view of the Camelback mountain right at your window was just splendidand prob gave this place an edge over all the others The resort is so huge it's like its own little suburbia They  have little "golf carts" to ride members to their room pool  lounge areas the spa or simply the parking lot out front A car is a definite must  Not that you can't walk around the compound We did a nice hiking trail up to Mummy Mountain (see pics) The rooms more like private units were incredibly spacious with king size comfy beds Equipped with regular TV small fridge and microwave Honestly I could have stayed inside our casita all dayHad great dinner at BLT steak restaurant Side bread consisted of a huge popover Gruyere Steaks were juicy and full of flavor Service was top notch Dining facing  a drop-dead gorgeous mountain view What more can you ask for from life Our last morning also had an amazing breakfast at Rita's Kitchen on the resort We frequented the famous Spa during our stay Very calm and serene We didn't get any fancy massages but we did lounge around the pool Felt like I was living the life of a celebrity Will always cherish this resort since we got engaged during our stay there Lovely memories.
Don't let the outside scare you Hole in the wall type of place but the best darn donuts in town You have to get there early because they are usually out of donuts by 8:30am The Donut Lady is as sweet as her donuts She is there every day but Sundays  I call ahead sometimes for the croissants because those run out first The place looks run down however in this day and age where people are losing their jobs and businesses God bless the Donut Lady for keeping her Making it in America Entrepreneurial Dream alive.
I've eaten here about 5 times and have never had a bad meal I've only had the double cheeseburger and can't try anything else because it's so good Get the fries with cheese on them and apply fry sauce This food will make you fat and happy.
After trying several cheese steaks in the area we found no need to continue our search the perfect authentic "wit whiz" sandwich By far the best this side of the continent.
Barf.
I had travertine installed throughout my home the week after Christmas I was impressed from the moment I walked into the Custom Floor Covering showroom Andy took the time to educate me about stone flooring Doug came a few days later to give me an estimate and a few days after that the work began I was very fortunate to have Charlie do the installation because he is a master craftsman The end result is beautiful.
Okay so I'll start off by saying I USED to love this place  When I was with-child their sandwiches and hash browns woke me up at night   On the corner of 5th and Scottsdale the joint was uber cool (with extra umlaut for extra coolness)   The vibe was hip and friendly   This used to be a 5 star joint  WHAT HAPPENED  We knew they were moving to Craftsman Court  We were expecting something great  But it was just the opposite  Ah man what a significant disaster   Biggest disappointment so far this yearThe outside windows were dark It was hard to tell if the place was even open   We entered to an awkward and misplaced drum kit   There was no clear indication of what to do  Is this counter service  It's hard to tell  We ended up ordering at what appeared to be a bar  Or a counter  Or something elseHalf of the space is decorated with Philly jazz posters dark wood a high brow style bar and a coffee machine   The other half had a general hippie feel  The space was split by a red billiards table smack in the middle  I tell you this place has a real personality disorder   AND the place was FILTHY I almost immediately regretted stepping foot in the space  It was dirty  Was that construction dust all over the floors and tables  Should we be eating here   Reluctantly I ordered the 1/2 sandwich lunch special   After a good 25 minutes I  inquired about getting our food to-go and was promptly responded to with a good dose of stink-eye from DJ slash cashier  What a messWith the new store Philadelphia Sandwich Co missed some of the key concepts critical to staying alive in the restaurant biz  including basic layout and flow  The lunch crowd was nonexistent on a Wednesday afternoon with only 3 other diners   One gentleman came in and promptly turned around to leave  I have to say I'm a bit concerned with their product turnover with that little traffic at a normally busy time the food can't stay fresh for long   The vibe up all night like a dirty pancake and not in a good way   The space filthy and not in a sexy way  The food now tainted   I hope the after 2am crowd can turn a blind eye and save this joint  I know my out-all-night noshes would rather be at the Awful House than here.
I used to go to Jalapenos many years ago before they had a fire  My friend and I checked it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised  The layout is completely different the menu is much more extensive and expensive ( OK though)  Our waitress JJ was right on the ball with drinks and our food order  I had the shrimp tacos and they were quite good  My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also  We have one complaint though and it's a big one for us  This was something we didn't notice until after we ordered and the food arrived  The people behind us had a dog in the restaurant and it wasn't a service dog  The dog was medium sized and in some kind of nylon carrier with screened sides and an open unzipped top  When we mentioned to our waitress that it's against the law she said "Oh it's OK it's in a carrier"  That did it for us we will never go back there again Instead of 3 or 4 stars we give it a one because of the dog.
There's a reason there's a banner that reads' Food Network Challenge Winner' hanging in their farmer market booth I've had Pastry Chef Chris's gingerbread cookies biscotti coconut/chocolate cookies and their carrot cake and they have all been really really reaaaaally good But today at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market I was knocked out by what she calls "Lemon Sunshine"  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie isLemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts I thought that the ones I had from TK's bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfectA must try.
I seriously feel guilty that I like Yogurtini so much I decided at the beginning of the summer to make it my mission to try as many froyo places as possible because I wanted to prove my never ending love for Yogurtology then I discovered Yogurtini  Now I kinda just feel like I'm cheatingNot only is Yogurtini's froyo super smooth and perfectly flavored they have angel food cake flavor  The topping bar at Yogurtini is outrageous and the atmosphere is great  Yogutini has enough seating to host large groups and they advertise free wifi which makes makes me feel like I should grab my laptop and make myself at homeYogurtini is a must try.
Very small place but very cozy When it's busy it's tough to find a place to plant myself One time on a First Friday night they opened up the backyard and was serving brews there and lots of open space There's occasionally bands playing therelove the fact that they serve Delirium Very glad to have found the lost leaf.
Clean theatre  Friendly staff  Love the tee shirt deal (you can purchase a tee shirt for $25 that allows you to receive one free medium popcorn ever time you go  Love Harkins.
Great atmosphere I love the (fairly) new expansion and bar area The cocktails are some of the finest you'll get in Phoenix If you're looking for a good drink try a Modern Fashioned or a Kindness Yvette Or just tell the bartender what your favorite liquor is and they'll mix you up something great.
This place is AWESOME  I am personally not gay but have good friends who are and we always have a good time here  The drinks are cheap and strong and the bartenders/staff are always so welcoming and nice  If you wanna go dancing-this place has a great little area with awesome DJ's playing the best of the top 20's and moreI've been going here with my friends for the past 2 years or so and always have a great time.
I like this place because it's close to work so when I have a early meeting come over for a meal.
Wonderful bar with a great atmosphere The food and service was quite exceptional I had the shrimp served with sweet potatoes the yummiest My friends both has the beef rib specials again wonderful For sure I will be back.
We are usually HUGE fans of ethnic marketplaces and food courts wherever we travel but a word of caution here is needed  My partner became violently ill after the combo plate here yesterday  He had the birria and the red chili with beef and potatoes  I had the  carnitas plate and was fine  If the food looks like its been on the line too long it probably has been.
well I am back again and I cant stop not coming to this place To review I love the ambiance of this place the warmth provided by the people here and ofc the food I got my veggie platter again with the 4 dishes being Fried Okra Mac & cheese 2 Eggs/Cheese & Onions and I cant remember what else but I remember feeling amazing bout it :) Oh wait did i eat waffles ah well I cant remember I think I should stop eating the sides and eat something else for a change next time like the salad maybe ah well to the next time then.
My new favorite pizza place  The pizza here is delicious  There's nothing fancy about the pizza it's just good  I order the ham and pepperoni pizza along with 12 wings  It's a special they have for I think 1399  The wings are just fine but I'm not really that crazy about wings all together   It takes about 45 minutes to be delivered  The delivery boys are very polite  I will continue to order from them for now on.
Best Thai in town I've been eating here since 1994 or so.
Sadly this Walmart is closest to my house but it is a complete and utter crapholeThe employees are always very nice but the parking lot is a battleground swarming with migrant workers scattered trash and random bums coming up to you asking for money the carts are a joke and I challenge you to find one that has even 3 non-wonky wheels the store is a friggen mess and checking out  Oh dear sweet Jesus I hope you have an hour to kill because that's how long it'll take you  I've never seen more than 4 lines open at once no matter how long the lines were  PatheticAnd no matter what do not I repeat DO NOT attempt to shop here on the 1st or the 15th of the month  Just gonna have to trust me on that one.
I have been going to Candy for 10 years and she is amazing She listens to the changes that I want to make to my "usual" and is so great Whenever my friends got a botched highlighting job or haircut they always go back to Candy to fix itVita Bella is clean & beautifully decorated with a warm atmosphere It is bizarre how many people I know that go to Vita Bella My sister-in-law goes to Lisa Stinelli to get her nails done and they always look fantastic Everyone I've come in contact with is so talented at this salon.
I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushiThis was the first time I went to sushi joint looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash While I am a huge sushi fan the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice) So sad My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned The grilled salmon was just okay served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay The server was also very clueless She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share =) She didn't think it was too funny She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out (THANKS)By the way the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something Who is the smart white guy that owns this placeI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back.
This restaurant is what simple yet gourmet cuisine is all about You can't go wrong no matter what is on the ever-changing menu.
Knowledgable bartender excellent food selections   Burgers are FANTASTIC  We went in late evening  Being a person that simply loves great food I tend to have the bartender waiter or waitress guide me on what to order  I have passed this place for years and years always had a curiosity to go in there  I loved the amibiance was crisp clean small but very well done  TV's lined the bar for sports and each booth is lined up against the wall so the TV screens are also in view of each person in the place  The female bartender was amazingly knowledgeable and led us down the right path  We orderd the wonderful asparagus with goat cheese the WINGS were absolutely delcious with no single flavor that overpowered another very good non-traditiona wings  The sweet and spicy burger was amazingly tasty but again excellent blend of flavors nothing too strong very creative  The peppercorn burger was also excellent however the cheeseburger was rather uneventful but it's also a 'cheeseburger" with no added love  We left this place 100 percent satisfied and excited for the next taste test  If you look at all of my reviews I most always stop short of giving 5 stars it was without a doubt on this one that give 5 stars   I love great tasting food doesn't have to be big portions or pretty just has to be tasty and thats what I found  I simply don't 'get the burger hype of Deluxe Modern Burger or Zin Burger the burgers here are much better and around the same price.
Check it out The power of Yelp I got this message from a former coworker who read my Yelp on Facebook: Hey Dallas - wanted to thank you for the Back to Basics reminder Taking my car there rather than the dealership saved me almost a grandTHAT'S what I'm talking about My little words A little reminder to someone about a solid little car shop and she saves $1000 FTW.
Let me start by saying that i am a die hard MAC fan only ever used MAC and am a total snob about it BUT now that i have basically every shade of their lipgloss and lipstick- i thought it was time to venture out of my little boxI got a MUA named Julian and he was AhhhhhMazzzinngggg We spent about an hour just playing with different makeup and he created a whole new look for me PLUS we made it budget friendly which was an added bonus Even the other MUA's were coming over to watch him work his magic on me I had so much fun AND got a new look I already set up another time to go in and see him for another mini makeover.
You know it's pretty ignorant for the shop manager (travis Tyler whatever his name is) to argue with a potential customer when they call looking for some work doneI need a transmission cooler installed and he wants to argue that I don't need one and he has no idea about the vehicle I am inquiring about It's a well known fact that the particular Army vehicle that I won needs one if I am going to be towing anything substantial Also he has no idea how the internal to the radiator cooler performs that is already present (stock) and that it is pretty inefficientas  a cooler But he doesn't want to listen and wants to debate it Idiot My money will spend just as well at another shop Way to go bro.
I am craving pizza right now and know that I will be placing an order at Spinatos to take home for dinner tonight I have been a customer for about three years now and it is my favorite pizza ever It will change your life.
Worst experience yetFor a highly acclaimed and talked about restaurant the place was revolting and an utter disappointment Now to be fairthe ambiance and atmosphere was very hip but the hostess and waitstaff were rude and unprofessional Even simple things like requesting a refill of a glass of water fell on deaf ears Our particular waiter was a complete moron who could not even remember his own name let alone an order And the food was over priced and under flavored In summary there are far better ways to burn your money.
Famous Dave's serves up the best barbeque in town without a doubt The staff are friendly the ribs are to die for and the desserts (if you make it that far) are simply awesome The feasts on the clean trashcan lid are good value if you have a large number of people in your party and offer you a sampling of some of the best items on the menu If in doubt though try the St Louis ribs I've had them often and have never been disappointed.
I am a big BBQ fan I really love that down south BBQ and prior to finding Fritzi's earlier this year I was going to Honey Bears any chance I'd get Now that I've found Fritzi's honey bears doesn't even belong in the same sentence I travel a lot and I always try to find that good bbq place while on the road and I've found some good ones But I am confident in saying that Fritzi's is by far one of the best I've found and its right here in my home state  Anyway Fritzi's is located in the same complex as Del Taco and Home Depot off Dysart and i-10 The food here is absolutely spectacular If you like Ribs Chicken Wings or even Pull Pork sandwhiches whatever you like its ALL excellent They slow cook the ribs of course the meat just falls off the bones and it is some of the meatiest ribs I have ever eaten in my life But like all good bbq places its the sauce that makes all the difference and Fritzi makes some of the best sauce you have ever tasted  This is a mom and pop owned goldmine dont miss out  I try to go atleast once a week in fact there is a picture of me on the wall for being such a good customer  If you go there for lunch 4 bone ribs is all you need I believe it comes with 1 side but it might be 2 For sides I usually get Mac and Cheese & Sweet Potato Casserole both are amazing  A friend of mine really loves the Mixed Greens  If you going for Dinner 6 bones will do I usually get a full rack (12 bones) and eat it over a few days  They taste great re-heated as well  I guess thats about it its St Louis Style BBQ Amazing stuff try for yourself PS They have really good deserts beef brisket and cat fish as well .
I had an akashic reading with Josefa and it was seriously the most heart-opening thing I've ever experienced It gave me an understanding of myself on a soul level and helped me piece things together in my life that I've always wondered about Finding out what my life lessons are and what my natural skill set is helps me in my business too Josefa gave me easy action steps to do that helped me get the most out of our session She records the reading and I just listened to it again the other day and I got clear on even more things.
Good service good food and portion sizes were great Left dinner satisfied and full Definitely will be returning.
Wow This place was amazing It beyond exceeded my expectations The lobster ravioli (homemade) the beef tenderloin and the specialty cocktails are all incredible Oh and the mac-n-cheese was amazing too Please check this place out It's to die for.
I normally like this restaurant However we had the waiter from hell Very pushy  A total Eddie Haskell Stay away from Cody.
service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
Stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee's sister Was greeted buy a guy with lots of unsightly tattoos and big hoops in his ear not exactly the type of person to sell jewelry but I kept an open mind We asked to see a couple rings and their price he slid a catalog toward us and said "they're all in there" He then walked away and talked on his cell phone behind the counter toward the back He ignored us from there I was ready to drop thousands on a ring but couldn't get the time of day On the way out a lady asked if we had been helped It's a small shop so the service was so bad they didn't even realize someone had helped us I said "sort of" and just walked out The staff should be ashamed of their behavior.
Just attended a wedding here and the location was beautiful Tiny little house on the inside but two floors and so incredibly romantic There wasn't anything out of place or too kitschy which was a relief and from the groom's point of view it was priced at a very very good range It was a hipster wedding's dream come true.
I agree with all these posts  cheap colorful huge menu good horchata tres leches cake at the panaderiaNot much more has to be emphasized however one reccommendation: get the ELOTE along with whatever you decide to get  Its corn on a stick covered in mayo and queso- delicioso  if you really want a treat squirt ketchup all over it too  mmmm market foooood.
To put it simply  This place sucks I have been asked to eat there three times for breakfast in the last three months for business meetings You always let the customer choose where to eat unfortunately they have all asked to meet at the Good Egg on Central How do you screw up Breakfast Wellhave cold Eggs cold Potato's and cold toast Three out of three times Horrible Coffee and VERY EXPENSIVE OMG kill me now if I have to eat there again The only thing I can say that is positive the servers seem to be attentive Go up the road and have Breakfast at 5 and Dinner on 16th St Not great but at least you'll get a hot Breakfast and get your money's worth.
Fantastic group of people They helped me with a loan and were the most responsive group of mortgage folks I have ever worked with They were so awesome that I moved in 25 weeks early Thanks.
Switch was recommended to me so we went there for dinner on a very slow weekday night when there were no more than three other tables Two of our party received their food in relatively short order My plate didn't show up until over 30 minutes later at which point the rest of the table was finished eating and needed to leave That situation wouldn't have happened if our waiter had been checking on us periodically or even been visible so I could have stopped him to have him check (Having had to leave the table prior to ordering just to locate him and put in our order should have been my clue that this was off to a bad start)I am very accommodating and understand when a restaurant is busy that this can happen but I felt there was no excuse for the delay I was very disappointed and have better places to spend my money and time I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
Phenomenal Taiwanese cooking Tastes closer to traditional home cooking than typical (and terrible) americanized Chinese food The eggplant in garlic sauce will blow your mind and the 3 cup chicken was the best version I've ever hadWould like to see a slightly larger dim sum menu but its much much better than any dim sum place in AZ.
Firebirds how I love thee You deliver the perfect piece of meat everytime - whether prime rib sirloin or ribeye Because of this I don't even know what other proteins you serve nor do I care You always have room for me to sit near the grill where the smell is devine Your wait staff is well-informed and happy to be at their job But surprisingly my favorite thing about you is your loaded baked potato I'm not sure how the skin is so crisp and salty and the toppings more fresh and mouth-watering than your steak Yes you are expensive and I do not care for your fat-ridden del Monaco But we should love our favorites unconditionally.
Beautiful presentation delicately simple flavors and a superb chef  We ordered one each of the seasonal omakase (which you have to reserve in advance since the ingredients are hand selected by Chef Nubuo and prepared by him only on the nights he is in house) and the regular omakase with wine pairing  First of all I thought I was going to be out by the end of the meal after drinking so much wine and I'm not a huge fan of wine but the pairings really were spectacular  There's also a list of a few thousand wines available if you are so daring to read through the whole thing  I was pleasantly full after the meal which included such dishes as seared octopus over tomato and fresh mozzarella oyster uni shooter (my personal fav) mushroom melange lamb chop etc etc etc Also the last dish of the regular omakase the foie gras was so melty smooth and rich that I almost cried I literally had to hold back the tears from pure culinary ecstasy  The dessert assortment at the end was a nice finish-- banana creme brulee assortment of ice creams green tea custardChef Nubuo is not only creative but incredibly kind and attentive to his customers  Not the typical stuck-up sushi chef  The hostess was a bit snotty since we were sharing omakase meals but we ordered a bunch of a la carte items and drinks as well  The total for four of us still came out to be over $400 so why she was giving us the glare from time to time I have no idea  If the chef is fine with it the hostess should care less  So aside from the annoying hostess all was well in Sea Saw land  It was a truly fantastic experience and one I would recommend you to try but be willing to open your wallet for the pleasure.
Sexy cool trendy artsy but upscale vibe as you walk thru the doorsDelicious creative mouth watering decisions as you scan the menuBeer wine bubbles and mixed drinks while you wait for your first plate in anticipationRelaxing cool music  design and architecture to check out while you chill outAttentive servers hot scrumptious food and full satisfied stomachsHappy full and slightly tipsy couple Returning is a for sureLoVe.
So I lived in Phoenix for 2 years and never tried back  I ventured back recently on business and decided I must make the pilgrimage Went first on a Tuesday night  We were told the wait would be 2 hours so we decided to go to Nobua instead  We went back on Thursday night around 9PM and were able to get in with just a 20 minute wait I LOVE neapolitan style pizza  Here in Dallas I go to Cavalli's on a regular basis and love it  I knew I would love Bianco the big question is would I think it is the "best pizza in America"It might be  Honestly any certified Neapolitan pizza place is going to be nearly as good as Bianco  It's not rocket science it's just the right oven and the right ingredients and the right touch  However I will say Bianco might do it a touch better than the rest The crust is amazing  It's perfectly done with just enough burnt on the edges for my taste  I ate every piece of edge there was which is unusual for me  (I tend to leave some crust edge)  The toppings are perfect the Sopprasata was amazing the fennel sausage was great the sauce was perfect It's basically the perfect pizza  Yet I was kind of disappointed  It made me realize that I've tasted the best pizza out there and it is only slightly better than some local places  I guess I should look at it in a good way that I can drive 10 minutes and get an amazing pizza at Cavalli any day of the week a pizza that rivals the best in America.
Ordered flatiron steak first time charred to a crisp  Sent back came back raw in the center.
Top notch company We were so impressed the first time we have called them three more times to come and complete small jobs: install/move ceiling fans install flush-mount ceiling lights and switches disconnect and patch old junction boxes and install new outdoor power sockets They ALWAYS arrived on time were quick well priced and even vacuumed up their mess before leaving All of their staff was nice courteous and helpful I even emailed the owner for some do-it-yourself advice and he was prompt in returning my email even calling me on the phone to tell me what to do I would highly recommend these guys.
My husband and I just got back from Berlin and on our way there we had time to kill in Terminal 2 of the Sky Harbor  THANK GOD we were in Terminal 2with the badass Military & Veterans Hospitality RoomMy husband is Active Duty Army and I am in the National Guard so this room was an option (sorry for you non-military types)It's too easyyou sign in and they give you the tour  There are couches computers with internet and a "library" where you can take books for your flight (you don't  even have to TRADE)  There is also a room for "little kids" with toys and a TV  a room for "big kids" with a TV reclining seats and a dimmed setting  Oh and some tables to go along with the free grub and sodasyou got popcorn gumall kinds of nice little thingsThe people here were friendly the room is clean cool and comfortable  If you have a long lay over and are military move yourself over to terminal 2 to hang out for a bitthey will be VERY happy to see you.
It's date night and you're headed to the moviesNow the dilemmaEat a small mountain of hot faux-buttered popcorn at the movies or a little popcorn and a  decent meal afterwardI go with bothOnly I'm usually too full to eat anything of decent substance after all that popcorn so I typically come hereTea Lite CafeIt's cheap and filling and its under ten bucksI've tried both the chicken based pho and the beef go with the beefit has a ton more flavorAnother bonus is how the meat in the soup is all very recognizable putting that whole dog and cat meat thing to restA large bowl will feed twoI weasel most of the meat out of it when my date goes to the bathroom And she wonders why I fart so much.
This was the most disgusting experience I have ever had at a restaurant I normally do not write reviews but felt I needed to share this My husband and I along with our 2 year old went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning I ordered the eggs benedict "Joynt Style" which seemed to be their speciality I also had hot chocolate and ordered a glass of milk We ordered the kids pancake with bacon for my daughter and a ham and cheese omlette for my husband My hot chocolate was average but what came next was appauling The milk they brought me was totally spoiled The eggs in my eggs benedict were over cooked so the yokes we totally hard the sauce was disgusting and my hashbrowns tasted like sausage My daughters pancake was hard as a rock and my husband's omlette was overcooked as well The waiter apologized and offered me another glass of milk I declined And he noticed that all 3 of us had full plates when we asked for the check He did comp my eggs benedict But I will definately NOT be back Hopefully this was just a one off situation but somehow I doubt it If I could give 0 stars I would.
This place really sucks I went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out I mean I know working sucks but come on it's your job So I give this place one star for the staff being rude and the fact that i had to go to the Ski Pro in Mesa to rent the clothes that fit me In the end I wish I had rented everything from the Ski Pro in Mesa Mesa Ski Pro is a lot more polite and will be more than willing to help you find what you need.
Move over Starbucks meet your competition While the prices are about the same and lower Dutch has a better roast and not a bunch of hoopla This location is a small stand with double drive thru You are in and out fast I like the lids way better too You don't spill and you don't need a stopper either If you're sick of bucks and the burnt beans go see Dutch Yumm.
We come here a lot for lunch Such reasonable prices (usually around $16 total with drinks) and delicious healthy vegetarian choices  Love the injira bread and all the choices We haven't tried the raw food menu much but hope to in the future Their falafel salad is great.
Get the knish with ham & cheese (smothered with mustard) and your tummy will know happiness This little treat saved my morning yesterday and I'm still thinking lovingly about it Next time I'm subbing the ham for bacon:drools:.
My family has been going to Dr Fuller for probably 7+ years It's been very hard to find a good Optometrist with a good staff We used to switch every few years cause the doctor was always good but no personality and the staff was off and on Meaning sometimes good other times they couldn't even fix our glassesDr Fuller is very nice like to joke around with us and knows our family Always asking us how our family is It's not just business which helps bring some personality to the doctor Also he will spend the time to explain anything with our eyes His staff seems to turn over every few years but he seems to always hire people who are very friendly helpful and smile I have never had any problem with Dr Fuller or his staff If you are looking for a really good Optometrist then give him a try Also it doesn't hurt that his office is close by our house.
Wow Laura is awesome I read the yelp reviews and then called her to get a lash tint She LOVES what she does and she is spot on at giving you what you want Her prices are reasonable and she is very accommodating with busy schedules I'm sold.
I come here a lot with my best friends We always order the Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla There was a bump were sometimes the cook lacked buffalo sauce but when we brought it up to attention it never happened again We never once had a problem with the service the servers are always in a good mood Kudos to the manager This place takes care of their loyal's.
I support local business recycle everything eat clean and consume as much used product as I possibly can If you're anything like me Changing Hands Bookstore is the place to spend your hard earned money Everyone in there makes you feel welcome from the cashiers to the stockers and your fellow shoppers I also actively participate in many of the events held by Changing Hands (Book signings language classes discussion groups workshops ect) Oh and if they don't have what you're looking for in stock they will gladly order itGet involved.
UNMATCHED DRINK SPECIALS Please show me another bar that provides a swanky modern atmosphere with 3$ pints 7 days a week of Stone IPA Nimbus Oatmeal Stout and other various craft brews on tap I'm a bit of a beer snob so when it comes down to paying 3$ for beers for what I would otherwise break the bank on at Copper Blues or any other bar downtown lets just say I experience liver failure at the end of the night PERFECT spot to pregame at before you go broke at any other spot on the weekends  The food department leaves a little bit to be desired in the portions department Don't get me wrong the flavor is on point but for the price Id like to see the portions increased I apologize for being a glutton haha.
This is the nicest city pool in the whole east valley It is more like a small water park A huge lap pool a seperate pool with a large kiddie play area 2 water slides spray pad whirlpool lazy river Cheap fun for the whole family Hours vary so go to their website for summer hours They do get VERY busy in the summer and are often to capacity by 1pm so go when they open or later in the afternoon around 2 or 3 and you should be fine.
Was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal I walked out wishing I went to Chili's.
Dr Stewart and her staff were wonderful with my 14 yr old shih tzu who went in for his first teeth cleaning and then 5 extractions  Their professionalism and friendly staff put me at ease for this procedure and my little guy did great  From the super clean facility to the compassion from everyone I knew that he was in good hands  Thank you again for putting my worries at ease and giving me more healthy years with our beloved KC.
Couldn't believe the water was cool on a 100somethin degree day So much fun except for the almost hitting the low-lying branches when the rapid water would drive us towards the edge Will be going back here soon.
I can't say enough how much I love this daycare My son has been going to MVCP for over two years now I knew from the second I walked in that I this was the place for us My favorite thing at first was that they only had I think space for seven babies total which meant my little guy was going to get a lot of personal attention Instead of feeding the babies like an assembly line like in some of the bigger daycare facilities we toured they actually held the babies when they fed them Each baby has their own crib and their own cabinet so you can bring your own snackies and stuff He has since moved up to the toddler room (soon to go in the "big kids room" as he calls it) and its still just as awesome The teachers are INCREDIBLE They are constantly doing projects and teaching them so much I just found out last week my son can count to ten in Spanish And now they are working on counting to ten in Chinese It really is the next best thing if you can't be at home with them probably even better since they get to have the socialization and interaction they wouldn't get at home We were so lucky to have stumbled upon MVCP.
Arf arfbow wowlick lickOk that was Emilie our Schnauzer's take on Wag N Wash and believe me she loves it there Right there across from Copper Star Coffee sits my beloved Wag N Wash The owners and staff are the nicest of nice I want to just hang out there with them all day Cept for the fact that I usually leave with random dog hair attached to my tounge They have a sort of Ben and Jerry's anti Petco mentatlity and I respect that They have a great stock of toys treats and other poochie gucci things The grooming service is fantastic Forty bucks for a 90 minute groom is quite a deal Cut to me trying to bathe Emilie in my tub and the ensuing waterworks flooding my bathroom floor Me cussing spilling my martini Emilie constantly violently shaking excess shampoo and water all over the walls Not pretty Also provided is a self washing area Well not self washing as in you wash yourself cuz well that would be weird But an area where you yourself can wash your dog They provide with an apron brush shampoos etc and constantly check on you And I can never leave without purchasing their homemade doggie treats kinda pricey at $10 for a bag but their made right there in front of ya and I love supporting the smaller business So wag your tail bitches and get on down to the WNW.
This place is great to get any nail service I like how big and spacious the area is and how they get customers in and out You barely have to wait and thats if you have to wait at all There's a menu of services for pedicures which gives you a selection So you dont get stuck with just the normal pedicure and they take their time as well You get your money's worth Pricing is average Go for a mani and pedi to give it a go : ).
Absolutely love the food that Switch has to offer me I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I wasn't absolutely satisfied with Oh wait I remember one thing their martini but I'm pretty sure I'm just not a martini drinker so that's why I didn't like itI love that they have monthly specials and I make an effort to try them out once a month Their daily $3 drink specials is so awesome The service has always been good to meIf you haven't checked out Switch yet then you are for sure missing out so get your butt over there and dig in.
Who wouldn't love a restaurant with great prices deep fuschia walls (yes) friendly service great food  and lots of parking (Hear that Los Reyes de la Torta)Upon reading Daren C's review I decided to try this place for lunch and had the pleasure of having Daren join me too I ordered the green chili burro lunch special The burro was huge had large chunks of tender beef and was nicely seasoned The rice that came with the meal was tasty and the beans - wow they're knock-your-socks-off good We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil Hmm culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people A great generous meal for $535 tax included So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods.
Loving this little spot  The cooks are friendly the filet kabob and basmati rice are great and the prices are reasonable  I hesitate to give 5 stars to a place with ambiance like a fast food type restaraunt but this place is exactly what you expect of it  Clean quick and remarkably tasty.
Horrible horrible service  I'll start off by saying this was our last shot at giving PF Chang our business because of a horrible dining experience the last time we dined inWe got there right at the start of dinner service  There was no wait but the two of us started the night's waiting list  We were told 5 minutes  We were seated in the foyer and watched 12 customers leave after eating  12  Were we seated  Nope  We watched about 20-25 more people come in and get on the list before we were finally seated after a 20 minute wait  I even asked the hostess how much longer and she replied with a "snippy" answer that we were next  Really  We were next  I think we could have figured that out since we were the first ones on the listWaitress was very friendly but the service was atrocious  We ordered a bottle of wine which took a while to get to us  When it did my wine glass was disgusting  It took 7 minutes to get a new glass  Seriously  7 minutes for a glass  My wife and I ordered the dinner for two which includes soup for each  Lo and behold my soup spoon had some brown stuff crusted on it  Had to wait wait wait for the waitress to return  She was no where in sight  Not in the dining room anyway  Didn't take as long to get a new spoon and she did apologizeThe food arrived in a reasonable time and it was good  Soup crab wontons sesame chicken sweet and sour pork  It was decent  But it was all delivered by food runnersWhen it came time for dessert we sat there and waited almost another 10 minutes for her to bring the dessert tray by and show us what they had  I think you can figured by now how long it took to get the bill and then to get the check to sign  We got there shortly after 5 pm and didn't get out of there until 7:30     To sum up food = okay  Service = TERRIBLE.
I loved Kokomo I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo The fruits were so fresh and the topping section was clean with a great variety I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy I highly recommend Kokomo.
This place is deceptive The lobby is recently renovated kind warm receptionist free parking but OH MAN are the rooms disgusting I don't know if they are currently under renovations but my room was old and dirty Some points of concern:Trash was still in the trash binsKitchenette looked like it hadn't been used in years and the fridge had a strange smellWeird spare day bed in room with sheets that looked like they hadn't been changed in a whileWallpaper peeling off the wallStrange locked closet in my room Creepy dudes hanging out in the parking lot ALL DAY Paper thin walls This place will do if your traveling through for 1 night but these rooms are set up for extended stays - I wouldn't want to spend any length of time in there.
Great food great service this will become a my new bi weekly eating jointAnd they deliverHad the Philly Max and am in love.
Long time customer I walked in ordered some food to go I guess they are doing a new thing where the cashier gave me three lids that were for small salsa cups At salsa bar I wanted more I put some salsa straight on my meal instead of the cups and a worker (instead of talking to me nicely he right away treated me like some criminal) scolded me for that because "to go" orders (even though I came inside to order it) were only supposed to get three small cups of salsa Huh If I decided to eat there then I can drown it in all the salsa I want but not if its to go They had plenty of my business in the past but will not in the future.
My family and I have been here 2 or 3 times and each time it's been great  We found it on accident and oh what a fortunate accident  Their homemade salsa is fantastic very garlicky which I love  The pico de gallo is fantastic  Bananas Ranas needs to take a note from this place (they serve Pace wtf)We're working our way through the menu  We took a visiting friend to this restaurant with us last time and he was very glad we did loved dinner.
I moved to Scottsdale from the east coast at the end of October  At home I took my car for oil changes and everything else to our small town mechanic who knew my Dad for a long time and so I knew that I would be treated fairly  I received great service and I have now taken my car her several time and will continue to do so  One time after I had been pulled over I stopped in to find out if they would sign off on this work order that I had been given by the police and the gentleman was kind enough to sign off and install the licence plate bulb for me and did not charge me a thing  I greatly appreciated his outstanding service and would highly recommend Lightning Lube to anyone.
One of the most unique and charming spaces in the East Valley: furniture clothing unique home decor  This gem in Mesa's historic district is locally owned and operated offering amazing personalized service.
Unapologetically kitschy and undeniably wonderful  The staff is very friendly and cool  Their deals are great  The menu is delicious-- especially the appetizers (hello crispy coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato fries with aioli) The Lilikoi margarita is my go-to drink It's just an all around fun place to go especially when it's not too hot and you can enjoy the patio.
I told my friend that I'd rather eat out of a vending machine and he said "Yelp THAT"   I had the calamari app the caprese salad and the eggplant rolotini  The salad was served in what i can only describe as a burnt upside-down bread "hat" that was inedible and in the way  The rolotini was a hot pocket only dry and crappy  Boo on you Crust.
My family and I have been eating here for years  It is a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall location  The food is always consistently great and the salad you get with your entree is the best  Also the garlic bread is amazing  Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of inhaling here are the lasagne chicken saltinboka fetachini alfredo linguini carbonara linguini and clam sauce sausage and peppers oh I could go on and on  Also they have a small bar which is dark and relaxing.
Davanti Enoteca joins the very small group of restaurants serving fine food in attractive surroundings at reasonable (sort of ) prices  The cuisine is certainly Italian but not like what you would find in a traditional Italian establishment -- this is more like what you would expect in one of the trendy restaurants in Bologna  For example: there is a bruscheta on the menu but there are also four "Vasi"s which are more inventive dips served with toasted Italian bread  We had the cannelloni (bean) and onion variety (the beans were pureed and you spread it over the bread)Davanti serves "sharing" style meaning that dishes come out one or two at a time and the table is assumed to be sharing them  If you and your companion each order an entree they may not come out at the same time  This presents Davanti with a challenge in pacing the meal -- but they manage to keep the food flowing without having dishes pile up at any one time  It also gives you a lot of changes to interact with your dining companionsThree of the five dishes we ordered were five star and the other two still pretty good  I think the pizzas are there least successful offerings -- perhaps they don't have the right oven and so the crust is chewy not crispy  The faro salad was spectacular  The asparagus came with tiny bits of rhubarb -- nice touch  And the chocolate budino dessert was right on target: a not-overly-rich chocoate mousse/pudding with toasted marshmallowAs a wine bar Davanti has a good selection of wines by the glass and both of the ones we had were outstanding  The wines are not cheap at about $10 a glass but the pour is generous and you can get larger pours for slightly more  The food dishes run from around $7 to $13 and two per person is sufficient so the total for us was under $100 for two including tax and tipTwo suggestions:1  Reservations on weekends are probably needed2  Build you meal from the starters -- vasis boards appetizers and salads and then add a pasta or pizza  You don't need to emphasize the "main courses".
Best auto and life insurance Had several situations due to a auto claim and Brian Stevens always saved the day Will be a State Farm customer for life.
OHSO is one of the many declining restaurants that is propped up by good food and a wide selection of beers and being dragged down by poor service I once went there for breakfast and had a waiter that was really spacey and inattentive He had to be reminded of orders and things he forgot more than once When I pointed out that fruit on my plate was moldy he took the single moldy piece of fruit off the plate ant set it back on my table reminding me that sometimes these things happen Really I've never been served moldy food before That is disgusting and the completely wrong attitude I took that experience as a red flag but didn't think it was damning Yet another visit clued me in that my money is better spent elsewhereI went one night and sat in the bar one weeknight after the dinning room had closed Just after I ordered food and drinks and group of people went from the bar to the patio to smoke The patio opening is as wide as the patio so the smoke naturally blows into the bar I mention the smoke to the bartender who brought our drinks and before I finished speaking she cut me off and said "because you're sensitive" in a completely inappropriate tone I should have just left then and there There is no excuse to be that rude to a guest Our food comes and it's less than impressive The fries in my order were recooked When the waiter cleared our table he dropped the two uneaten cups of mustard that come with the pretzels on the floor He was upset because he got mustard on his pants He wasn't that upset that he'd gotten it on the floor which explains why he left it there When I left the table I slipped and nearly fell from it What kind of jackass just dumps something you could slip on in front of your table I tried calling the restaurant to voice my discontent and no one would ever pick up the phone I sent a message through a forum on their website The response I got back was defensive and told me I should have talked to a manager that night So should I have talked to the rude bartender or the guy to busy to clean up the mustard from the floor The message might as well have just been a suggestion of other restaurants to visit instead.
I love this tanning salon They have great beds and offer awesome products I used the extreme bed which is a stand up bed and I can honestly say "there is no bed that beats that one" Some of my friends have tried their spray tanning and they really like the products they offer.
This place has everything  Even the old type double edge razors  They also have the straight edge ones with disposable blades for $15 and $17  I paid $79 for the same type of razor in San Francisco at one of those fancy stores that also sells tobacco  The lady in the store was great too  Very friendly and helpful I have to say that she should be a model for shampoo  I almost asked her for hair dye that would be her color  Anyway great little store if they don't have something they will get it for you.
Always fantastic food always fantastic service Travis is a Fantastic Chef and Brian and Bo are fantastic managers who always make you feel like your the most important people in the place This is my favorite restaurant.

Turning 50 has changed my skin a bit and I'm sooooo not ready for this  Where have the last 25 years gone and who took my radiant and youthful skin I want it backI had a consultation with Alison of Face-Labs at a holiday boutique I wasn't expecting much since it's advertised as mineral make up  I used Bare Minerals for many years and loved it - but it's not so great once you start getting fine lines and creases - it actually started accentuating those flaws instead of hiding them  I thought this would be much of the same - but it wasn't  The make-up isn't powder - it's liquid and it's specially mixed and matched to my own skin coloring  You have a choice of how much coverage you want and whether you want a sheer dewy matte etc type of finish  You get a choice of how much coverage you want  It's all mixed to exactly how you want it - with or without sun screen and/or mixed with a primer - so you can skip that step in your super early morning routine  A plus for me since I have to be up at 4 am for work and I am NOT a morning personFor the rest of the day I continued to get complimented on my skin - by strangers even  I'm 50 and people have always thought I was about 15 to 20 years younger than my age - I've been noticing those compliments have been getting fewer and farther between - so it felt good to have people noticing my skin againI have ordered more products and will be happy to review them once I receive and try them but I can't say enough about the foundation  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for coverage made perfect for themAs for Alison she's a sweetheart to work with She is very knowledgeable about her products how to mix them just right and was truly focused on coming up with the easiest routine and best products to meet my goals and expectations  She's a beautiful lady who is fun to work with.
Five star the place is well decorated I was like a kid in a candy store Love it So colorful and full of fun stuff I took a pic with the nerdy glasses The person who helped me and the cashier was very friendly I got the vietnamese coffee sandwich with chocolate chuck cookies and the molasses crisp Yumm.
Decided to use Hot Wok due to they deliver and near my work I was craving Chinese food till I took the first bite I ordered Orange Chicken with White Rice and a order of Pot Stickers there fried version Wow was i let down First portion looked to be good but man quality of food was a let down First Orange Chicken had no texture nor flavor was soggy and i do say soggy as you can get Second the sauce really was a let down no flavor but i do say the sauce that was at bottom of Chicken did have a little flavor but not enough to go around for portion plus i didn't want the chicken any soggier Third Pot Sticker ooh my god really soggy as well burnt first of course No flavor kinda like a place you can feel safe taking you great grandparents due to taste or flavorlol joking aside man they where just terrible I would never recommend this spot to anyone should delete them from site that's how bad it was who knows maybe i just got the wrong night wrong cook but man i am never going back again.
This is by far the best yogurt place I have ever been to I am a yogurt snob and I am glad that I ran across this place The first thing I notice is that the owners keep pride in making the place spotless Secondly the workers are very friendly (couple cute ones) and always willing to give you a sample cup I recommend trying a couple sample cups to see what you will like The flavors are awesome and some are switched out every so often Some yogurt places have a weird chemical taste to it This place does not have that taste at all The price is also by far one of the most competitive in yogurt industry Yummy tummy.
This buffet is possibly the best I have ever had That is really saying something because I have been to Vegas 17 times in the last 4 years    Thought it would be nice for my mom and I to check out a local buffet so I jumped on yelp and found the reviews for this place I have driven by here many times but really never noticed it We went on a Monday night and expected it to be pretty busy Lucky for us the place was almost empty when we arrived We were seated at a very nice booth and placed our drink order At first I did not see where the actual buffet was until I noticed people walking through the archways and into another room I think that's a nice touch Makes eating a but more relaxed and quiet        We walked in and checked out everything before starting to fill our plates Pretty nice selection Lots of very nice cold meats and cheeses These turned out to be very good as I tried several I tried most everything they had to offer and was really blown away by the quality and freshness The prime rib was excellent as was the pork chops and especially the duck drum sticks These were my favorite and I ate my weight in them to prove it         The deserts were also very good I tried bites of several different cakes and pies and indulged in the gelato as well I did not notice the crepe station until I was picking out my gelato It looked like they were making bananas foster so I went for a closer look Low and behold that's just what they were doing Well I had to have some of this I ended up having them place it on a crepe instead of gelato This was fantastic as was every other desert we tried        All in all the buffet was excellent Everything was very fresh with top quality all the way down the line We are going to go again for mothers day when they have a special menu Can't wait        Give this place a try you won't regret it.
Sorry  Maybe my expectations were too high as many folks had told me how great this place was and specifically how great the BBQ was In fact the BBQ spare ribs may have been the worst I've ever endured and even that might have been given a slight pass had the wait staff been even remotely nice or friendly  But that was not the case either so we had an awful meal served by a staff that even a mother couldn't love and for this cowboy I'll not be back  Ever.
When my grandmother passed away I inherited a lot of her old jewelry  I kept the pieces I wanted and wondered if I could sell the rest  Burland did a great job on my custom ring so I came back  The appraiser Mark sat with me for a good long time going through each piece  He helped me determine which pieces were worth getting officially appraised and which were not  I settled on getting appraisals for 4 specific rings  Another employee kindly sized the remainder of the rings which will help with resale  They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable  The appraisals were done in about a week - great description and photos  I know very little about jewelry so I always worry that I'm going to get fleeced  This family-owned business appreciates each and every customer  I will definitely return.
I wouldn't have had a problem paying high prices for mediocre food if at least the service was good You would think that being as close as they are to US Airways center that they would staff accordingly too No such luck tonight $70 later still hungry and thirsty I would not recommend this place to anyone Managers should pay more attention to the guests less to the hostesses.
these guys have been doing it proper since day one best customer service and best selection of boards and gear.
Love it Great coffee and service with a smile.
I can't believe that there are ANY negative reviews of Honey Bear's  I've been a customer for decades having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal drum outside the original East Phoenix locationI now frequent the Central Ave location and the food is still as good as it's always been  If all that matters to you is ambiance this is probably not the place for you Honey Bear's is all about the foodSomeone complained that the pork was too soggy  Another that the pork was too dry  HOW can it be both  The pulled pork IS "soggy" because it's JUICY  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE forSomeone actually dissed the barbecue sauce  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found  The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth) I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs  So I tried the spare ribs and while they are good they just don't compare to the baby backsI had never tasted "collard greens" so I decided to try them  Now I'm hooked  Since I liked them so much as HB's I ordered them when I went to Notorious PIG another barbecue restaurant I had to throw those awaythey were loaded with vinegarI will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork pulled chicken and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants)  And for other HB's fans "Deal Chicken" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food  Beat THAT.
If you judge a BBQ place by the smell when you walk in the door this place will get your attention right away  It smells like any authentic down home BBQ joint you have ever been in  Before you are even greeted by the friendly staff it's a good sign  The menu is great diverse and everything looks great  I had the Cuban sandwich which had pulled pork mustard and pickles with a side of jalapeno Cole Slaw  It was exceptional  Other favorites at the table were the baby back ribs  The meat was falling off the bone but not overdone  The appetizer was the potato chips with ranch dressing  If you love chips this is the perfect dish  The worst thing about the appetizer will be stepping on the scales tomorrow morning :)  Well worth the extra pound it added to my waistline though :)The BBQ sauces were the best Madison our server was great atmosphere was great and the food overall was better than expected  They also do the little things right like have Stevia in the raw not a huge thing but very noticeable in terms or doing it right I would recommend this place to anyone who loves BBQ or wants to try something different  We will go back for sure.
First time here was great I walked in just to see what the place was like and was immediately greeted by Joe  Super chill dude answered a lot of questions all while working on a piece for someone else  I began to ask if he could help me fix one of my tattoos and then we talked about my (hopefully) soon-to-be sleeve  I already have a cupcake tattoo and wanted to get a friend for it so Joe drew one up in a couple of minutes and I was thrilled It was super cute and exactly what I was looking for  He was poking me with needles and ink shortly thereafter and when he saw that my existing cupcake needed a little touch up he offered to fill in the spot for free and added some sprinkles:) What a great first time experience  My newest edition is healing up very nicely hardly had any itching or scabbing and it looks great  I will be coming back to Joe for my sleeve for sure.
Wow what a great little place Growing up in Louisiana and longing for a shrimp or Po-boy Flavor of Louisiana you have answered the mail and talk value you get your monies worth.
We showed up at the Mesa location on a Friday night around 6:30 and even though the restaurant seemed full we were seated immediately I must say that I really appreciate a nice hostess and the service we received from the time we stepped in the door to the time we left was always above and beyond We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was lovely because we were able to observe the lively staff and take in the design of the restaurant Our server gave us great recommendations on drinks and food and we left satisfied and already planning our next visit back This restaurant gets an A++ for being delicious friendly and having a great environment I can't wait to dine at the Blue Adobe Grille again.
Love this place  And being kid friendly is a huge plus for us  We have had the pleasure of eating here several times and have never been disappointed  Wait staff has always been friendly and pleasant  We do not  mind waiting on average 20-30 minutes  It is worth it  Love this neighborhood cafe.
I tried Yogurtlogy as part of a gluten free foodies tour (#gffoodietour) and this may have been my favorite stop on the tour I love froyo and this store did not disappoint I sampled every gluten free flavor they had and found the chocolate/banana combo to be my faveThe owners of this location are becoming more aware of the needs of the gluten free community and have separated their toppings that don't contain gluten ingredients from those nasty gluten-y ones Score Makes it way easier to choose toppings and then I don't have to worry about someone accidentally dumping Oreo cookies into my sprinkles :)The owners are really the nicest and asked a lot of great questions about Celiac and the gluten free lifestyle so that they accommodate more customers that need gluten free options.
I was totally impressed with this place It is super clean tons of machines several change machines and even games to keep the kiddos busy The woman working (didn't catch her name) put all of my clothes in the dryer for me so that was awesome I saved so much time and was able to get some errands done I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to use a laundromat once or every week.
I'm a big fan of California Pizza Kitchen They have many great menu options--just don't be on a low-carb diet Their pizzas salads and sandwiches are all good from my previous experiences As for this location in particular expect a bit of a wait Friday-Sunday as this is a popular and centrally located location I've found the service here to be good but not always consistent I frequent this restaurant a lot and while the service is always acceptable and almost always excellent there have been a couple isolated incidences where I feel the service could be a little better.
A little surprise in my Sacks sack today: an extra cookie  They usually just include one cookie but I guess I got the hook-up  That and it was Facebook drink day meaning I mentioned the occasion and got a free drink out of itSacks continues to be well staffed with nice folk and innovative with their sandwiches  I'll definitely keep them at 5 stars because at their price bracket they offer a serious and original sandwich  I'm still buzzing from the ice tea I had at lunch (or maybe it's the extra cookie).
Located in the suite the used to be Massage Envy this place is lovelyKudos to the better decor then what was previously there the atmosphere is clean and freshThe massage room is decorated nicely and I appreciated that they had a little place to put my bag and jewelry (something that's missing in a lot day spas)My therapist Dominique was attentive and thorough I really felt that he listened to the concerns I had and the reasons I had come in (back pain and a pulled hamstring) I am VERY picky about my massages and not easily pleased so I have to say i was pleasantly surprisedNext I'll try a facial stay tuned.
If I could give this place a ZERO STAR I would  From the moment we walked into the casino a wannabe-police security rudely told us that we could not roll our luggage on the casino floor but had to follow the non-carpet path towards the hotel  What casino has a no-luggage policy on the casino floor  One of our friends forget his wallet in his room after check-out  His wallet was found in lost-and-found but his $200 cash was gone  Front desk people had no customer service what-so-ever  All the workers need to sign up for customer-service 101 in Las Vegas NV where hotel guest services are impeccable  Even though the hotel was modern customer-service is what makes guests' experiences positive and guests wanting to come back.
You can't go wrong with a Waffle House No matter what type of day your having Waffle House will always put a smile on your face Good food good memories and good people.
Dr Jazz was great Im used to chiros that put me through an assembly line not even really noticing the issue Dr Jazz is more thorough and takes the time to treat the problem and help prevent it from triggering in the future Thank you doc :).
I think The Chuck Box has been around since the time my dad went to ASU which was many many years agoWhen I was living in AZ I would come here occasionally & I've been here a couple times over the past few years when I've been in town for a visitThe burgers (and BBQ chicken sandwiches) at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS  If you like burgers & can care less ambiance/atmosphere then come here  If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five starsLike I said the burgers & BBQ sandwiches are fantastic (and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as wellthey're served cut in half on hamburger buns)  Everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh  A couple things at The Chuck Box that I think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sidesparticularly the fried mushrooms & zucchini  I don't know what it but the mushrooms in particular are to die for  In addition there's a large condiment bar w/plenty of fixings w/anything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing which is perfect for the mushrooms & zucchini  The place itself isn't much to look at but who cares  There's only one person taking orders as you walk in and there's often times a line almost out the door  They also just call orders out as they're ready not necessarily in the order as they were placed so things can gets a little helter-skelter but in the end it's all good and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets.
Love this F&E location  It is always clean staff is always friendly and the food is always great looking  The fact that they offer organics local brands as well as your typical Kraft Mac and Cheese boxes is a huge bonus  This makes it higher on my list than Sprouts or Trader Joe location since they don't carry mainstream brands alongside their local selections  I like that I can find Charmin toilet paper organic veggies and ready made meals all in one place.
As always great service and lots of fun its a tad expensive for fondue but its worth it especially for special occasions.
this is a great place for Sushi and food Its always fresh and the food is also very tasty The rolls taste fresh and the pieces are well portioned they have a great happy hour Good prices and selection also great drinks  :) The cook will also come out and greet you He'll make sure you are satisfied I also had Ro as my waitress and she is just AWESOME I highly recommend this place Overall VERY SATISFIED.
My husband and I go to Alberto's often as we are locals  It's great to have a neighborhood place where you are greeted by name  Alberto the owner is a real gem and runs this charming and cozy place Ask Alberto for a wine recommendation he'll give you a great bottle in the price range that you ask for The warm homemade bread with homemade dips and great olive oil are a great way to start the meal The bruschetta is fabulous and a must-have starter  I also love the Artichoke salad it's very unusual and tasty with plenty of shaved parmesan My favorite entrée is the Fettucine Alberto- a cheesy tomato sauce over fresh homemade fettucini  The pastas are good sized portions and you will not leave hungry Sadly I'm not sure we've left enough room for dessert on our last few visits  Enjoyable meal cozy setting and great food.
Update: They asked for my number to contact me about my experience  No call after a week.
LOL @ 1-star review That's hilarious reallyCafe Bink seems to be the much more approachable little sister of Binkley's It's situated right along Tom Darlington (Scottsdale Rd) just before you hit Cave Creek Simple little strip mall location with an interesting shade-sailed patio A little close to the road noise but great views to the West This is a real new bistro menu and from I've had so far it's wonderfully executedSETTINGScenic if you ignore the stripmall to the East Carefree/Cave Creek is a different beast than it was 10 years ago for better and for worseSERVICEOur amiable but ditsy server managed to get everything out in order and with a smileFOODJust look for the pictures from Ron B above That's my review Plus the 5 stars Only thing I will say is: best frites in town Wish they had a straight up Aioli And the green dipping sauce was just "off" somehow for my taste Otherwise well I gave it 5 starsBOTTOM LINEIf you get near it for some reason check it out for lunch or dinner.
I will try catfish and southern food where ever I can find it and I had a Livingsocial for this place so even though it was out of my way I decided to try it I don't like spicy anything but I have to say that I also thought this was the best catfish I've had So much so that I had to go back and make sure I didn't think it was so good only because I was hungry It was just as good the second time This time I decided to try some of the sides The mac and cheese was just okay I've had better The greens were just too bitter for me I couldn't finish them But I will definitely be back for catfish and try the BBQ next time Very friendly people working there.
loved it but it's expensivewish they did coupons for 85226 area code.
First snow of the season in Arizona this weekend went to check out the website as I like to shop local I'm a pear shaped woman I require a size xl in snowboard pants  I want something cute no luckevery pant I looked atRide 686 DCall not available in XLDid I mention they are all current season items I'm looking atI would understand if I was trying to get a deal the website clearly has a size chart for  each brand and the measurements for XL are clearly stated on the size chart but there are no XL SIZES available to purchase  Come on Ski Pro where is your love for the curvy girl I'll shop some where else where I can get my size and look stylish.
Took my car in this afternoon I have been having problems with pressure light coming on over the course of a year  I figured I might need new tires or have to patch one up  Either way I was feeling a bit anxious wondering what the cost was going to be  I brought my car in and I was surprised not only by quick service but everyone was friendly  One of the technicians did a walk around with me checked my pressure and told me they would check to find the source of the leak  In true auto body nature I expected them to find something anything just to sell me a set of tires or pay for services  WOW what a surprise they simply put air in my tires did an inspection and told me my tires were just fine NO CHARGE  The change in temperature was to blame for the pressure light coming on  WHAT  YOU ARE NOT trying to sell me something I don't need  You have no idea what it feels to walk away from a auto shop and feel that they are being honest  They now have a tire customer for life.
They have relocated to the Biltmore Shopping Mall at 24th Street and Camelback  Yay  They serve wine or coffee with chocolate candies or cakes in a sit-down cafe and they sell custom-boxed candies or ready made and wrapped gift boxes  Their chocolates have a distinctive flavor different than Godiva or Ghirardelli (sp)  I don't usually like creamy chocolates but theirs are an exception for me  The cakes I have tried are top shelf Yum  I have not had the wine  The coffee is rather good (says the Starbucks gold card holder) It's a fun venue when recharging after a movie at AMC across the street and before taking home an adorable pet from Petique or a new Coach bag (less responsibility in the latter case) or a British cruiser bike.
Ok so when I'm in the mood for the real deal I go here for some tasty goodness  Everything here is AMAZING  I LOVE their chips and salsa YUM.
This is a super belated review for this café (more than a year old) but I have a grudge that I need to voice During finals week one semester I ordered a coffee It was super hot which is normally a good thing but after more than 10 minutes of waiting I really wanted to drink it There were about three people in line and since I still had 15 minutes before my exam I got back in line and waited to ask for some iceInstead of bringing me a small cup of ice an employee came from behind the counter with a scoop of it Instead of waiting for me to set my cup down the employee proceeded to dump the ice in my cup while I was still holding it spilling hot coffee all over my hand and the floor Did I get a sorry Nah He stared me down like it was my fault and then stalked off without even bothering to cleaning it up I left for class about ten minutes after the incident and there was still coffee all over the floor You couldn't pay me to reconsider this place.
Great food Fantastic service Lovely atmosphere Dinner was absolutely Delicious I wasn't sure if I liked some of the sauces that came on the entree & the waitress had me taste everything before I made my final choice It was a busy night & she apologized for our food not being up faster without me even complaining about it & gave us 20% of our bill The atmosphere was casual & relaxed The staff is so friendly & welcoming you just can't help but feel comfortable & happy to be there They have a return customer in me :).
I love this location The people are courteous and friendly and I have never had to wait in line To make a very very very long story short: I am a recent convert to Wells Fargo Tom Quinsler the Branch Manager for this location went out of his way to assist me in the cash purchase of a home Due to the large nature of the transactions my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain I was not a terrorist or a thief Tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that I could meet the date requirements for my home purchase Tom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers' need and that is customer service that we just no longer see My thanks to Tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience.
This place does not honor reservationsMade a reservation via opentable and specifically requested Teppenyaki only to show up and be told we had to wait 2 hours Can't speak to tonight's food quality because they decided not to serve it to me.
Ate once will never go back  The food has no flavor it is fine to make an attempt at healthy food but you cannot substitute real butter/ghee with vinegar to kick flavor up  All the curries had a muddy consistency and vinegary after taste   How can you screw up rice  It tasted stale the grains were broken up like it was from a bag century old - this was not basmati  This was the worst of both worlds but the public relations about "healthy" will fool the "naturally" endowed botox/silicone crowd of scottsdale.
I work at the Zoyo next door to Vovomeena - Today was my first time ordering from them I truly had a wonderful breakfast I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which is a traditional breakfast - i wanted to play it safe lol And it was amazing as i was waiting for my food i saw a few other dishes that looked amazing The menu is small yet the options have so many items it seems bigger The best part is the coffee bar which is all "locally crafted" as it states on their menu They can make u just about anything Ben the Barista was a super sweet guy and gave great service The decor is beautiful Check it out u will not be disappointed.
The Queen Creek Olive Mill is the perfect outing if you're looking for something new to do or if you're hosting out of town guests It's located approximately 45 miles from downtown Phoenix on the edge of Queen Creek Allow for at least 2 hours to spend at the QCOM which can be filled with the 30-minute tour sampling lunch shopping or just hanging out with a bottle of wine at one of thee seating areas available One inside the store/café an umbrella covered patio or the picnic benches shaded by the olive trees The Café offers breakfast specials sandwiches paninis soups salads bruschetta gelato and special wines The store sells a variety of olive oils stuffed olives cremas and tapenades made from olives grown/harvested from the local grove    Recommended items-Burnt Mozzarella Bruschetta (3) melted mozarella roasted garlic and a tasty oregano pesto- burnt to perfection    -Mushroom Bruschetta (3) wild mushrooms herbs and caramelized onions-  A generous mix of shrooms and onions -Mansi Panini Tequila lime roasted chicken fontina  sun dried tomato parmesan tapenade and tomato parmesan crema: comes with a side of olives and chips The tour:An educational guide on how the olives are grown harvested and processed The complimentary sampling bar includes a variety of:Olive Oils: about 10 to taste from- surprising twist were the vanilla bean blood orange and lemon infused olive oils Tapenades: 7 to taste from - My fav was the caramelized onion and fig Stuffed Olives: About a dozen to taste from - All were great but my top two were the Oregano feta and Vermouth garlic stuffed olivesThe olives olive oils and tapenades sold on site are great gift ideas for folks looking for Arizona made products Will be adding a few to my x-mas list Our trip to the Olive Mill was very enjoyable and we'll be adding it to our must see AZ places for our visiting friends and family.
Been to many Sonic restaurants before so I knew what I wanted before I was even at the call button    2 chicago dogs / large onion ring / medium limeadeBoy what a disappointment    the hot dog buns were so soggy that on the first bite everything fell out and left me a relish and mustard mess    the rings weren't any better soggy and the onion still tasted raw    well at least there was the limeade    where's the lime tasted like spriteWill definitely not be back to this Sonic   .
Cave and Ives is an excellent restaurant Great food great drinks and great atmosphere I love the drink selection They have more beers than I could possibly try in a year The food is always delicious and they frequently have specials unlike anything on the menu I love the layout and feel of the restaurant Casual dinner environment with a fantastic patio My recommendations: Crispy Bravas Fries Chopped Salad Red Goat Pizza Sicilian Pizza Lemon Chicken and Artichoke Pasta.
This is an update to my previous post  I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street  MAJOR MISTAKE  It was way over priced crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance  I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert I'll never cheat on you again Rehab.
This place has a very retro feel I love the big booths and the entrance is kinda cool(you walk through the kitchen) Great place for a martini for me and a huge steak for the man in my life :).
I love Judith at Foxtail Salon I really am not a fan of obligatory chatter when getting my hairs cut but Judith is interesting funny intelligent warm and friendly and I enjoyed my time at this salon All this and she is also great hair stylist She made my hair super soft pretty and cute and smell good for a reeeeeeally good price The salon is easily accessible small bright fashionable cute and clean You do have to pay to park though if you park in the lot infront of the salon  I am moving out of the state soon and sad I can't take Judith with me.
My girlfriend does not eat gluten so we decided to try Indulge for lunch as they had a very extensive gluten free menu I had every intention on buying a carnivore burger however decided to try a veggie burger instead If the name of the restaurant has "BURGER" in it I am assuming a burger of the veggie variety would be fine as well I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else she said "We have VERY good veggie burgers" Cough riiiiight  Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu we should do so early as they take longer to prepare so we ordered them in advance(baked not fried)  She came back to take our actual order and not 3 minutes later brought out the fries before the burgers Ok a bit early fine by me The fries were soft in many places and burnt in others I thought there were "MEH" my girlfriend thought they were gross A little while later my veggie burger was served - a shriveled up cow-pie slapped between two buns with leaf of lettuce and onion perched on top A pickle and some carrot shreds garnished the plate The server saw my confused expression and said "Oh we don't put anything on the veggie burger but if you want some ketchup or mustard" Seriously No aioli No spread No hummus or anything to damped down this dried up patty of cardboard  I ate half of it primarily because it kept falling apart (nothing was used as a binder apparently) I had to eat it with a fork but a spoon would have been better It was so bad I would have prefered one of those frozen Bocca or Morning Star veggie patties For $9 it was such a joke My girlfriend's gluten free burger was a $12 burger on a salad She asked for guacamole and asked if she should write it on the "build your own burger" menu pad they give you The server said "nope I will remember" Guess who forgot the guac Her burger looked lackluster and somehow a dill pickle on a salad seemed wrong Frankly I'd rather Indulge elsewhere.
We arrived with 14 people and were greeted with smiles and treated very well even though the workload was enormous for this small Waffle House staff  The service was excellent  Good Job.
They have awesomely flavored ice creams But that's not even the best part about this place It's always clean and cheerful inside the store The workers are kind and friendly and it comes from a genuine satisfaction and pride they have from working there My family loves going to Scooptacular because we always have fun there There was never a time that we were disappointed at all I would not be surprised when my daughter becomes an adult and looks back at fond memories of her childhood Scooptacular would be definitely be a part of it.
Had a great experience with Scott and Jason from Critter Ridder I have had previous problems with rats in both my attics I heard noises in my bedroom I called Scott the next day He sent Jason out to inspect my house He found no signs of rodent activity He explaned everything in a easy to understand way Jason did not charge me for the inspection As a business owner for over 30 years I can appreciate Scott and Jasons professionalism I would definitely recomend Critter Ridder.
Food is a little pricey but it's organic and healthy so I guess you get what you pay I love the food here You can sit outside on the picnic table or inside with the a/c If you're olives connoisseur you won't be disappointed.
I've been trying out all of the chinese restaurants in the area and I think I've found my new favorite  Its right next to Church's chicken and I only found out of it because of the tiny sign out by the roadThis place doesn't look like much from the outside or from the inside  I don't think I'd want to sit down here with friends Its clean but there's always a TV blaring some show or news that would interrupt any conversation  Take out is probably the way to goI've gotten take out from here twice so far  The menu says specifically that soup is not included with the dinner combos for take out  Both times I ordered they included the soup anyway  The soup is very goodWe've tried Chicken Lo Mein Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork and all three were great  They give you plenty of food which is great if you like leftovers  They're about as fast as any other place and thier prices are great  There are a few other places that I dropped in to get menus from and I probably won't even try them after seeing this menu because they cost so much more.
I love this place  I have been here quite a few times and this review is long overdue  Having been to Sichuan province I can say this is very authentic  To really appreciate  the true nature of the food you should be a spice fan  I am and the Water Boiled fish is my favorite meal  I also think the steamed dumplings in chili oil are some the best I have had with delicate wrapping and delicious filling  The Mao Po Tofu is quite good and my wife is a big fan of the Almond Chicken which is not spicy but very flavorful.
The best gluten free veggie pesto pizza ever So good Was there with a bunch of yoginis and well just assumed I'd be hungry by the time we all left but the pizza was amazing and hit the spot Took the 1 tiny piece I had left to eat laterThe service was excellent and so patient.
This is a nice cafe with a diverse menu There's indoor or outdoor dining with a view of the famous fountain I ate here with my friend Connie who also posted I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was great They also gave me a sample of the smokes salmon soup which was very much like it sounds The service was excellent i was impressed Will definitely recommend and go again myself.
Fast friendly service I wondered how they would treat me since I'm female and they have always taken the time to explain things to me They came out and replaced my sand filter They were on time very clean about their work and the work matched my quote Here's to the mom & pops that are still around and beating the big box competition in all areas Thank you B&L.
I love foodI had the steak roll ups and some potato salad  Steak tips had mushrooms and carmelized onions in them and this delicious dipping sauce that I kinda felt like drinking it was so dang good  The coolest coke machine ever is here (we need some in Text) it is a touch screen coke machine I was watching th people in front of us do it first so I didnt feel too stupid taking my turn  It was way coolwish I would have gotten a picture  The area is great next will have to try a different place in same areaThey also have pictures up around the entire restraunt that were drawn by kids at the Childrens hospital was a very cute touch.
Happy hour until 8pm and huge selection of wine and craft beers  Limited seating so get here early.
You've got to get the guacamole & pork shoulder  Cool atmosphere and great foodwe loved this place Service could've been a bit quicker but the quality of the food made up for it.
Worst Chinese food I've ever had I tried the Sweet And Sour Pork lunch special The rice supposed to be "Fried rice" but it was just your run of the mill Uncle Bens style brown rice that had zero flavorThe pork itself was tough and chewy The sauce for the pork was blandThe combo came with an egg roll which was soggy and had a weird flavor to it.
While on vacation in Scottsdale we visited The Sweet Tooth Fairy  What a BIG disappointment I will say this place was bright and airy and had a nice decor but that's the only reason they get even one star  We purchased 12 cup cakes - there were six of us and we thought we would save the other six for the next day  Kids will eat anything and our four kids took one bite and threw the remainder of the cupcakes away and were happy when we thew out the rest of the uneatten cakes  Cup cakes were dry and OLD  The cakes tasted like they sat in the frig for days  Very disappointing  On top of all this the service sucked   There were six of us picking out cupcakes so we were taking a little time - one impatient customer (the only other person in the place) asked if she can just pick out her one cup cake because she only wanted one - before I could even answer the lady that was helping me said sure gave her the cake and said it was on the house - making us feel like we were the problem that she was compensating her for  This was a BIG waste of our money.
Holy Mother of GodI had been going to the WF location on Raintree and assumed all Arizona stores were created equal I had no clue that I was missing out on the most amazing grocery experience of my lifeAlbert H suggested I come here because I am a craft beer geek and the selection at Raintree was good (in my opinion) but he said it was better hereIt's not just the beer selection that is better EVERYTHING ROCKS This is just like the Whole Foods that I would frequent in Southern California--built for an educated affluent consumer There is a full-on cafe WITH a liquor license This week they had a special on Sam Adams Cherry Wheat and Boston Lager which you can enjoy with your delicious mealThe craft beer bar (YES bar) had over 30 different types of beers on draft (handles rotate regularly) and several wines for the oenophileThe seafood bar is diverse with different Ceviches salads and such Soups are plentifulI could go on and on about the rest of the stuff you already know Perfect produce fresh meats etcThe cheeses Yeah tons Thank God I'm not lactose intolerant I won't even tell you how much I spent on cheese Towards the end of my shopping trip I hit the beer cooler I spent a good 30 minutes trying to decide which beers would dance upon my mouth I ended up going with some Dogfish Head beers and fell in loveIf you love good food good beer (and wine) and don't mind dropping some coin then this is the spot Make it rain bitches.
To make this easy the best breakfast I've had in a long time Service was excellent and polite We ate there 3 consecutive mornings My only regret is that you have not franchised this place in Chicago We'll be waiting Until that day comes we will have to wait till our next trip to Scottsdale.
I had one of the finest meals I've ever had at this restaurant and the setting is quite gracious.
I must say when moving to Phoenix a year ago I was disappointed with the restaurants around the city  I had tried all these places that were supposed to be just amazing but was always left wanting more  The Coronado Cafe filled my expectations more than I had expected  It was one of the first places I had heard about when I moved here a year ago but never got around to trying it until recently  I was pleasantly surprised with the food and thrilled with the atmosphere  Little houses converted into restaurants have a certain charm about them that big corporate restaurants will never be able to create  The food was fresh and tasty but not overly fancy  They offer a nice inexpensive lunch menu and a more upscale dinner menu  The service was unique meaning I did not feel like I had my own personal server slave for the time I was there  I felt like he was somewhat stand offish but we always had refills etc when we needed them  In all honesty it was nice to not be interrupted a million times by some disgruntled robot of a server who clearly hates their job  So even though the service was not the typical upscale service it was still good it just had its own flavor.
I always turn to yelp when exploring a new place I've never been It was my first time visiting Tempe AZ I thought to myself "Where is everybody" Driving around on the road in the middle of the day it was 90 degrees out and there weren't that many people out Then I went into Harlow's for brunch due to yelp recommendations and realized everyone was here LOL But really I think everyone is indoors when it's hot out The food here was phenomenal I had the eggs benedict Perfect taste and perfect portion This is how all eggs benedict should be My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well (biscuits and gravy)  and the service was great.
Why did I give this place 5 stars  Cuz of the 50 cent Coronas Delicious.
I love this subway It's clean fast and I always leave happy Krystal who is also the manager is always sooo friendly Ex: I told her I was dieting and she gave me all kinds of tips She removed some of my bread  loaded up on  my fav veggies no cheese and also gave me light mayo packets so I could measure exact calories I always appreciate great customer service I am loyal to this particular subway just because of that.
Stimmler and Sons Air Conditioning was actually an HONEST air conditioning service  Dealt with many companies over the years and I have never found one like this  They were on time knowledgeable and cost-efficient  The most painless experience I have had with an air conditioning company  I would highly recommend them  This is the only air conditioning company I will be using from now on.
The Good:  The dispatcher was very friendly and tried to help me out as much as he could 5 stars for himThe Bad:  The tech his name was Sean came over and gave us a quote on a blower motor (that was under warranty) and said it was $700 in labor for a half days work  We said were gonna get another quote and he became rude and said he wouldnt come back if he left  So we got another quote and everyone said this guy is hosing me by about $600 We got two quotes for $100 and another for $300 I now have a guy fixing it within one hours time for $100  Way to hire the winners here I will make sure to warn everyone about this company.
I had been here a couple years ago and it was a pretty good experience but then I came here again recently for a Miranda Sings concert and I was very disappointed Can you say RIP OFF The tickets were reasonably priced ($20) but then there was a "two drink minimum" rule I wasn't thirsty do I opted for the cheapest option- I ordered a lemonade which was super nasty So I sent it back and ordered a sprite instead- also very nasty I don't know how they managed to make their simple fountain drinks taste so bad Anyway the next time I saw my waitress it was to bring me my check which was $13 I had only drank a couple sips of each of my drinks and that's what they charged So stupid- that's almost the price that I paid for my ticket itself Anyway Tempe improv should pull out of the food and beverage thing all together and just make stadium-style seating so that everybody can watch the performances a lot easier and not be ripped off and forced to buy gross drinks.
Friends was sold on 6/7/2013  The new name is Zorfs  Friends was a great place to socialize drink eat and enjoy  Zorfs is following the same agenda while adding new energy and apparent increasing clientele  Check out Zorfs on Yelp and add your comments  The owner Kenny is in the establishment much of the time  He welcomes your comments and suggestions personally.
I was in Phoenix recently for the WWE Royal Rumble To kill some time that morning my friend introduced me to Portlandia on his iPad in our wretched hotel room Around 11AM we were hungry and ready to check out so we consulted Yelp for brunch options and settled on VovomeenaUpon arrival I wasn't sure if I was still in Phoenix or somehow had been transported into a Portlandia sketch As others have noted it's THAT hipster A "flight" of Japanese cold brewed coffee - really Even more amusing was the proud barista describing the cold brew process and the different coffees And I have no idea how he could tell the different coffees apart  it's easy with a flight of beers but coffee all pretty much looks the same But after pinching myself and realizing I was still in Phoenix I went for the flight of cold brews (When in Rome  err  Phoenix right)The food options were equally hipster with a selection of a dozen or so breakfast/brunch offerings featuring fresh locally sourced food The only thing NOT hipster about the food are the prices I typically expect places like this to be a bit pricy but Vovomeena is a VERY good value Most of the selections are in the $7-9 range I ordered the most expensive selection - the bmoc It featues a smoked pork chop waffle two eggs and a "Portuguese Donut Tower" (basically a funnel cake) for $995 My friend got the "pain perdu" - banana bread pudding french toast with a caramel glaze and choice of meat for $750 Both portions were ample and everything was delicious And even though this is counter service the service was great I joke about the barista but the kid (he looked like he was 17) was really nice and knowledgeable It reminded me of talking to a brewer (or beer nerd) at a brewpub - he had that level of knowledge And when I went back for a 16 oz cold coffee after I finished my flight he admitted he accidentally made an extra flight and asked if me and my friend wanted it Thanks dude Needless to say between 1 1/2 flights and the 16 oz coffee I was amply caffeinated for the day Of all the places we went to in Phoenix this was my favorite by far I doubt if I ever will be back in Phoenix  but if I do Vovomeena is a must stop for me.
I recently had an issue with my cat Heiko where he needed to have his elbow fixedSee: http://wwwyelpcom/biz/pride-animal-hospital-chandler#hrid:iWYZtW8yfDP6ptvcnK6L6AI was referred to SVSS After I left Pride Animal Hospital I called and made an appointment for early the next day 6:30am to be exact This is perfect for me since I work night shift and with 6:30 I could just get off work and go straight there instead of staying up half the day when I was normally sleepingI met with the assistants and Dr Tara Enwiller I loved all of the staff including the front-desk They were very thorough and Dr Enwiller was very helpful in describing what had happened whereas Dr Chen was unable toThey brought out the two estimates (closed re-set of dislocation or the open surgery) They explained all the risks and everything to meAside from the seemingly simple procedure costing a lot it was painless I actually opted for the more costly provedure which I had to put 70% down But I said they were to just do the less costly procedure Then I left for home slept and picked him up when I was doneThe post-op debriefing was also well done I need to go back here soon to see if I can get his cast fixed (not their fault)So I think this place is top notch My cat has a cast on with an awesome looking fish decal on it and he seems happy with no pain I will chalk that up to a good clean procedure.
I love love love this place  It's been around for 10 years  Just down the street from me and for some reason I just never got around to going  Finally in November my mom and I went for dinner  AmazingI'm a convert  I'll be a Coup Des Tartes for special occasions and just for fun  The food was wonderful  Recognizable with a twist  Fresh ingredients and really nice service  This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley  From the pictures on the walls and photographs on the fireplace to the staff  I took my boyfriend for a romantic date night the weekend before Christmas and it was great  He said the same thing I'd been thinking "WHY haven't we been coming here for years"I think I thought that it was much more expensive than it was  Mom and I had one app one salad and two entrees for $80 (including tax and corkage) and BF and I had one app one salad two entrees one dessert and two corking fees for $121 (including tax and corkage)  No bad folks  Pretty darn good actually  It's BYOB so we had wine that would have cost us over $150 in a restaurant but we brought it from home  I love itStandouts for me were the mushroom & Gruyere tarte lovely and cheesy and flaky all at the same time  The lox and potato appetizer was fabulous and I'm not a big lox fan and I loved this  The baby arugula salad with pears feta and candied pecans was a perfect balance of flavors and textures  The lamb entree is good and surprisingly I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific  Most amazing though is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse  Light and fluffy and rich and decadentBon Appetit.
Very disappointed to find out our favorite pizza joint is now closed this saddens me seeing as how Nick's has the best pizza I have had Don't know why they closed they had the best everything.
Always forget about this place cuz its so far from the food court  Great food atmosphere & fast service  If you want to relax with your $10 salad away from the food court chaos come here  Also Ron Goldman's dad with the mustache from the OJ trial works in the men's suit dept just leave him aloneunless you want to buy a nice suit of course.
This is the place you go when your looking for a band tee or poster or stickers or hats or anything else you can possibly think of that you might need to buy your band stuff on haha In all seriousness this place has everything for the person that doesn't want the same cookie cutter bs clothes in the mall I love this place In all honesty I've bought my shirts here for the past 3-4 yearsonly here If your looking for anything dark rockabilly gothish different then this is the place for you They also have baby and toddler sized stuff too to rock your kid out hahaha.
I just finished my Head to toe Glow package and I feel like i have added 10 years to my life :0)  Spa Lamar is a wonderful retreat  I cant wait to bring my mother in for a spa day when she comes to visit  Kudos.
Waitress was awesome n I had the new chopped steak burger it was good n my bf had the royal red Robyn it was also good fries was awesome.
I never win Except once but the macine was broken They took their money back Now I'm sad Thanks for reminding me.
Great trendy place with knock out burgers pizzas salads and sweet potato fries If the prepared meals here could speak for it's self it would sound like a Mozart symphony with a dash of Jay Z and Katy Perry to soothe your five human sensesAtmosphere is really mellow relaxing and dimmed light setting which makes your company or people watching a little more easier on the eyes Lol ok so that was deviated a little bit but on a real note the decor and options of seating from the bar high table with chairs(like barstools) patio dining or booth seating is fabulous for  consumers like (moi) who like optionsAlso location is great perfect for those who commute via light rail and love that FEZ has reverse happy hour(HH) all week unlike other places who only offer reverse HH on weeknights and discontinue on weekendsService is always exceptional helpful and friendly Now go and enjoy FEZ you won't be disappointed :).
Great selection my husband is the cook in our family and is obsessed with the fantastic selection of olive oils This means I get to try some tasty dishes and sample some of the wonderful oils this shop has to offer.
Pattie'sI don't get it.
Came here w/ the hubster's I've actually been craving this for some time now The pollo fundido is great So goooooood Its a pretty big portion The rest of the food looks really fresh too The best part is that they have churros Great prices and food.
Love this place The 7seas soup is my favorite Soooo good They have one of the best carne asada tacos.
First off this is a GREAT LOCATIONSecond: NO COVER CHARGEThird: Pool table beer pong table and great music insideFourth: HUGE SPACE with lots of tablesFifth: TWO BARS one at front and one in back That's already FIVE STARS in my book But hold up we are chilling at the bar in the back and there's also an outside PATIO PLUS PLUS PLUS Loved itWe were helped immediately by the bartenders in the back: Tony & Kristin (both were EXCELLENT)Tony sure knew how to start the conversation especially cuz the BF had on his SJ SHARKS jersey cuz we were in Arizona ONLY to watch the Sharks play against the Coyotes We got our conversation going there and ever since had nothing but GREAT SERVICE after that They were very attentive both Tony & Kristin I ordered the two dozen wings with half honey sesame and half medium spicy They were so delicious It's making my mouth water right now as I type They know how to make their chicken wings (AS ADVERTISED) on their menu The BF had the Long Island and he really enjoyed it especially because it was the SPECIAL for only $4 You can't go wrong with a price like that They also had other beers and well for $2 $3 SOOOO AFFORADABLE especially if you are a college student I would definitely recommend coming here Also Tony is super fast He is "THE BEST" bar tender I've seen With so many customers at the bar he manages them all and gets them their drink immediately I've never seen a bartender quicker than Tony and he remembers everyone's drinks PLUS ONE STAR FOR THAT but I only can give five stars I would DEFINITELY be back to Blondies if I ever come back to Arizona but I heard there's one in Vegas too Guess I'm hitting Blondie's up in Vegas.
We had a late night meal here after going to pick up a drunk from Nascar The Staff was more then excellent man did those young guys have the customer service skill down They asked all the right questions the register while ordering offered to refill drinks for an elderly couple cleaned and wiped tables for people I was impressed The food was standard 5 guys which is one reason to continue to go here Quality and consistency While I think 5 guys is an average burger I gave the extra stars for the staff here.
Took myself to Rocket Fizz today to check out their selection and wow it was amazing A  ton of unique sodas British imported chocolates (including my favourite chocolate in the world Nestle Yorkie bar from Ireland) a wall of taffy (definitely try the gingerbread flavour if you're into that) mixed with assorted small candies ($399 for a medium bag - see photo - as full as you can fill it with whatever out of the bins = awesome deal) and assorted novelties All the sodas are $189 no matter what size which is a little more than I'm used to paying but if you get the 4 pack (also have 6 and 8 packs) it's like buying 3 and getting 1 free which is a pretty nice deal The guy who was working alone was super nice and funny and let me take home some of the discarded bottle caps for free (I collect them) Most of the sodas are out of the cooler but they have a few coolers filled as well so you can drink them right away There's also a lot of sugar free and organic candies for those that need them 5 stars for selection and service I'll definitely be back the next time I need a sugar fix.
Really unhappy last night at 10:30 stopped by with six friends and all toppings were put away and chairs were stacked up I think if you are listed to be open till eleven you stay open I love yogurtology but maybe it's time to try a competitor.
Terrible terrible service hey Thanks Beth I'm not coming back There are too many good restaurants in this area to put up with poor service and management that is to arrogant to make sure their dinners enjoy their meal and evening.
My favorite place in the valley  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the "Scottsdale" crowd much more laid back You don't have to dress up in heels to go either flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights  But if you are in heels beware of actual sand outside Bartenders are always friendly just a good place to chill with friends  Also the Baja fish tacos are awesome here  The nachos are ok too  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends.
Do you miss NYC and the neighborhood Bagel shopWell it moved to PhoenixBagels are great with a crust/shell and soft insides not just browned breadExcellent base for Spreads and SandwichesWant to support a local business this seems to be a family run businessSandwiches are great  as are the cream cheese spreads smooth and tastyBut I think the best part is the owner welcoming and friendly and he remembers you after you have only been there ONCE  I think he is from Jersey so it must be Jersey hospitalityGreat to be welcomed into his business every time you step through the doorNo need to tell you so support local business go get the best NYC bagel in PhoenixJust  happens to be in Awatukee.
DAMN this place has everything sushi pork chicken beef soups shrimp fruit Ice cream even pizza OK this is the kind of place that is dangerous for a big man trying to downsize I almost went and found the manager to have him bar me from this place It's just too tempting It's like one of the really good seafood buffets in Vegas I saw no down side to this place Me and a friend had lunch and it came to $2400 for two I could have easily ate that in shrimp and ribs alone Man I'm getting hungry just typing this If you like a good clean and plentiful buffet this is the place Damn they are good.
Amazing  We stayed at the Biltmore over Christmas with an all-inclusive package  With this package we were able to try a large variety of items on the menu  The staff was incredibly friendly and recognized us by the 2nd day  The first day we started off with the smashed avocados  Great flavor - def not boring  We also tried the pulled pork empanadas  Not too much flavor but not bad either  During our stay we tried the pizza (late night and the pie was HUGE) the Burger (awesome taste) and the chicken and goat cheese flat  All were very well prepared and had great flavor  So maybe the reason the cheese pizza was incredible was because it was after cocktails but really not bad for a resortDefinitely need to try the FF prepared in duck fat  We tried this one and the sea salt fries  They were both good but the duck fat fries had just that little something extraWe ate Christmas dinner at F&A's also  Very good again  The best part was the table-side smores  Overall our experiences were wonderful  Even though most of our meals were eaten here there is still more on the menu I'd like to try.
I really like trader joes Lots of healthy affordable choices Good organic selection This store is very crazy though Always busy and I swear the people shopping here are oblivious to rest of the worldMaui short ribs = so good on the grillWith organic frozen jasmine rice Great mealMaybe I'll try shopping late fri/sat night to avoid the crowds.
I am a bit apprehensive being the first to review Pearls  That being said I am not going to miss the opportunity to be the first to give this place 5 starsThe owner is phenomenal  I cannot say enough about her "radar" for when to talk to you when to leave you alone and when to just be AWESOME  She is a lot of fun to chat with (for both the husband and I) and we get a kick out of herThe items in her store are always in great condition  It is impossible to leave without finding some little treasure or big treasure actuallyThe location admittedly can be a trick to find  However driving by and then turning around is no big deal - just do itPearls is organized like a department store  You have hats jewelry knick-knacks dresses skirts shoes pants an entire mens department a kitchen/household area nice fitting rooms seatingCan I gush any more  Basically if you are into retro/vintage or just having a good time shopping you need to check this place outAnd on a side note:  I would like to see a lot of tourists in here  Locals + tourists = great business.
Bistro Classic pizza followed by a pizzookie (ahem pizza cookie)   The food is great (It's not down town chicago but so what) but the service is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD  I've been to the other locations and it seems I've had the best service here  They were SO nice to my 5 year old and that always goes a long way for a parent who's afraid his child will get bored and turn into a three headed dragon at that table  I's a comming back that is a fact.
Tuck is certainly "tucked" away in the neighborhood that is has landed itself  What a pleasant surprise  When we Looked at the place from outside we automatically knew that it was fitting for what we were looking for small but open and well lit but also good ambiance  There is one large family size table for a party of 10  The rest of the tables are two tops and four tops We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and treated very well  Now the foodwe started with cheese curds that were very tender and absolutely delicious and very lightly fried The Mac and cheese is amazing There was no real ingredient  that jumped out at us the overall combination of ingredients made this a truly delicious dish  I highly recommend this  We then had the skirt steak which was also extremely tender the rub they used had a slight kick to it but not overpowering It was served with potatoes and lentil combination that was simply delicious The skirt steak was fabulous  We were not impressed with the garlic and bread for $500 and would have been happy with the baguette bread (plain)  but they charged 200 for that Overall I love this place and will certainly be back for more flavor challenges.
I have never been so disappointed in an oil change First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door  They never called  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was  (I had it checked out at different place)  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up)  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work  They chose to scare me instead  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
I went to Chirofit after a car accident and it was the best thing that I could have done Dr Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape please forgive the pun The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things I'd definitely recommend the Peoria AZ locationThe ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym.
Horrible service almost an hour to get our food  NO discount on our food but yet the manager had no problem sitting at the counter eating his pot roast  Not once came by to apologize or comp food  Complained to corporate office and got a generic all purpsoe email  Umm yeah about the $25 I blew for bad service cold food and attitude  I was starting to turn my attitude about Denny's thinking they were doing better but they proved they aren't  THings happen but when the corporate office can't even call to apologize that is saying we don't care.
Ohh if I could only give them 0 starsI brought one of my suits in to be dry cleaned  I just usually have them pressed to take the wrinkles out but it was time to get them dry cleaned  When it picked it up the next day my suit pants had a huge tear in the leg  The lady claimed that it was like that when they were turned in  I asked her "why would I bring in a torn up suit to be dry cleaned" and "why wouldn't you call when you found the tear"  The lady could not give a straight answer and her body language tone and answers given indicate that she wasn't telling the truth  I asked to speak to her manager but no one else was there.
Crackers & Co Cafe is as good as it gets for breakfast and lunch We go as often as we can and we have been eating here since this location opened about 4 years ago (and eating at the other locations for at least the past 20 years) My husband always has has all-time favorite baked potato soup with all the fixings and Bird to the Wise -- a turkey and bacon sandwich on a really yummy croissant I'm more adventurous and have probably had everything on the menu except for eggs Benedict - only because I don't like hollandaise sauce I can honestly say that I have never had anything that I didn't like here at C&C All the sandwiches come with homemade soups and the salads are to-die-for and huge Once in a while the soups have been a little inconsistent but if you tell them about it they fix it You can't beat a restaurant that is always willing to fix whatever they can fix I haven't noticed any inconsistencies in at least the past year My daughter eats from the kids' menu Of course she always wants the chocolate chip or Mickey Mouse pancakes which she adores but I usually try to talk her into some scrambled eggs for protein instead of having a carb-filled meal She has loved everything she's ever had from the kids menu She is a picky eater so this says a lotWe have had many of their desserts -- and they are yummy Their signature dessert is the Brandied-Cinnamon Bread Pudding It's devine It's so hard not to order a homemade dessert here And usually when we bring guests we always splurge and get some kind of dessertLike I said above C&C is as good as it gets for food service and ambiance.
I have never had a better doughnut They are like a drug you just gotta keep going back for more.
Wow  Best sushi I have had in a while  I went here with 4 colleagues after a round of golf at GrayHawk down the street  We were seated promptly and the staff was super friendly  We had close to 15 different rolls some wine and sake   It was the best dinner of our trip and can't stop thinking of how good it was  Highly recommend this place.
This is my new go to brunch spotTom the bartender (whos super cute) hooks it up Let him have his way with you(r drinks) and he won't steer you wrong First beverage he brought me was a blackberry champagne mojito super light and refreshing The second was also a champagne cocktail of sorts I believe it had some sort of peach puree in it It was absolutely delightful  The coolest thing about it was it had a sphere of ice in it that looked like a crystal ball Magical As for the food it also didn't disappoint Tom suggested we start with cheese stuffed jalapenos not fried Oohy gooey and oh so tasty My entree was the huevous rancheros pretty straight forward but lighter and crispier than I've had before served with roasted root veggies Surely palate pleasing.
Bliss Delight Contentment words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens I could go into a very fluffy review but with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant I will only address and highlight ~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed~Attentive but not aggressive servergreat attitude ~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven ~Homemade infused alcohol finally in Phoenix ~Open kitchen I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal All items served "tapas" style great opportunity to try many items Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience either enjoy the food natural or enhance with dipping sauces These are not the heavy sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame ~Mango Spring roll light fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced ~Soup Gyoza 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate brothdivine ~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts try a dip of the accompanying sauceecstasy prepare to order 2 they're so good ~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp "hushpuppys" very good but not the highlight of the evening Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion ~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian "slaw" ~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these familiar flavors with wonderful dipping sauces No-one in our party was disappointed everyone was very pleased and anxious to return  ** Personal Suggestion *** Have a food allergy   Use common sense when dining Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering.
All I have to say is afternoon High tea Baby OK-So who can really afford to go to the Phoenician I mean even on a "staycation"-the place is hella spendy BUT-if you are looking for an elegant time at a decent rate try their afternoon high tea It is honestly the best I have had with the exception of Tea in London at the Dorchester And much less expensive than the Dorchester which ranks the Phoenician High on my list What an experience first off you can chose from a regular tea or tea with unlimited Champagne Both happen to be very reasonably priced The area they serve the tea in is incredibly elegant and outright gorgeous big fluffy velvet couches some high backed upholstered chairs silver place setting and English bone china  They also have a pianist playing calming music that is just loud enough to remind you that he's there The food and fair is plentiful the tea is divine and the champagne flowed Best of all the staff is comforting and they allow you to take your time and enjoy the ritual of the experience I highly recommend this place A+.
Oh Gammage how I do love thee My husband and I usually see 1-2 shows a year  I would definitely see more if we could afford it  It's so much fun  I've always found Gammage to be comfortable and does a fine job providing that classic theater environment  It's big enough to house big shows so you feel like you're getting a Broadway experience every time you go  Someone on here complained about parking but they have their lot as well as parking garages  You must not have seen them  We've never been without a space and we have gone at various times of the year I work at ASU and I like to walk to Gammage sometimes over lunch  It's such a pretty building with pretty landscaping  And sometimes I can hear bits of rehearsals going on which is always fun.
This is absolutely hands down the best frozen yogurt shop I have ever been to  New York Cheesecake = Amazing Chocolate = Delicious Cake Batter = Phenomenal  And to top it off - they have the best toppings  Cinanamon toast crunch cheesecake twix crunched up sugar cone hot fudge and 50 other toppings  I usually go to Orange Leaf - but this is way better.
As they promised it was less than 8 minutes through the line and believe me I was timing it from the start I mean it is the first thing you see as you walk in to the store Great location and they do deliver from 11am to 2pm which will now be well utilized going forward The store however is very clean and warmly decorated and it pulls me to come back again I had the Italian which is one of their signatures and for good reason I am a man of simple taste but a strict eye for detail The sandwich was amazing to say the least The help was knowledgable and very friendly I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try for yourself Who knows you might even run into me if you do.
Use to be the best airline Now they won't let you use banked monies from family They are also stupid not letting you fly standby for earlier flight Thereby freeing up later flights They have raised their rates so much on last minute flights that the are more expensive than almost every airline.
My first "6 star" review goes to Flowerama Let's start by saying I was hesitant to choose Flowerama for our wedding flowers based on their signage Yeah I know But lure me in However let me tell you fellow readers ignore the building and GO IN It's well beyond worth it I met with (unfortunately  "former" manager Shannon) who had worked there forever and really knew her stuff She was so amazingly knowledgeable I'm no flower expert but I know quality I set up an appointment for the next week for my husband and I to sit down with her to place our order (Lucky girl huh Most future spouses steer clear of assisting with flower duty) We arrive and she is ready to roll Has the books set at a cozy side table Now I have odd requests I'm not what one would call a "traditional" person We wanted to place an order for table flowers (3 tall per vase per table) for 30 or so tables and bouquets of wildflowers as a gift for all female patrons at our reception with our vows (from a song) tied around them She knew everything in season- what would work what wouldn't and how we could arrange them *HERE comes my 6th star: I wanted 7 flowers per bouquet Well my flower knowledge was lacking more than I thought because this would have cost more than my dress So what does Shannon and the Flowerama staff do Talk me down to 3 gorgeous flowers that tied up in absolute beauty with the EXACT look I wanted That's customer service folks I would have paid the initial amount without hesitation as I wanted them to be full and pretty Flowerama saw my vision and made it happen saving us almost 1700 dollarswithout me even asking how to decrease the overall cost  That's a "personal" level of service I have never seen Thank you SO MUCH for going the extra mile Every single flower was in mint condition and gave me tears A wedding day is a big deal and I had ZERO stress over the breathtaking flowers they provided Talk about a company who really does care I just called to verify information and spoke to the owner David Jones to verify name information for this review What a stand up guy who does truly have down home values and a passion for customer service They have proven it isn't all about the money Thanks for being honest and not trying to "make a giant profit" off someone trying to make a day so special For listening to what we said and making it happen (I will post pics when able from a different computer) "Little girl I have found love the kind that old folks all speak of And no poet can dress it up with fancy words It is patient it is kind it forgives and it is blind And it cannot break no matter what you've heard" -Levi Lowrey (Tied with raffia around our perfect bouquets).
We had the two bedroom two bath suite It was quiet clean and great amenities The front desk staff has excellent customer service skills We were told that there will be renovations to upgrade this already fine place Loved the easy breakfast and fun happy hour that is complementary.
Went here for fathers day waited ten minutes before we were greeted Had to send back mushroom burger because Roy was cooked at the wrong temperature and had a stale bun Although the manger was very understanding to the situation and pod for the burger it was an overall bad experience.
I never knew Ice Cream could be so complexThrough my childhood I was always used to eating the ice cream basics I never knew of the possibilities Some of the flavors at Sweet Republic are a little out there but still amazingI have always been pretty open to trying new weird or interesting foods but ice cream was always supposed to be a safe bet Lucky for me I know that if you want to have fun in life you have to take risks And so I did The strangest flavors I tried at Sweet Republic I did not expect to be good at all I think the two most surprising were the Bacon and the Jalapeno Avacodo which were strangely deliciousMy very favorites were Mayan Chocolate and Peach which surprisingly tasted good togetherMy best memory at Sweet Republic was the eating contest which unfortunately I could not take part in because I'm allergic to bananas but watching was almost as funThe service here is great they are so friendly and helpful to people who are new to ice cream exploration You can really tell that they are passionate about what they do.
This is bad this place is right across the street from where I work and I fear I will spend all of my money hereSosososo good Great Soy LatteI wish they had bigger sized cups because it soo good.
DISLIKENormally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal NEVER AGAINI like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendousAllow me to clarify Not the flight itself but the plane I might as well have been on a private jet I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane I'm 5'1 Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small 'approved' suitcase only to come to find out that it wouldn't fit in the overhead storage Again - terrible Again - reference to the size.
There is no place that can provide the same level of customer service that you can get at Berning's  The pieces in the store are of the highest quality and are unique  They are not mass produced like the products you see in the malls  Zach and Patricia bend over backwards to fix repair search and find exactly what you're looking for whether it is a new engagement ring or an antique watch.
Great food I love the coconut shrimp The menu has a huge selection which you can enjoy for a month without eating the same thing.
I know that this airport strives to be the friendliest Perhaps they need to share that philosophy with the people that work here Thankfully they have Blue Moon.
Best cookies I've ever had I'm glad I don't live closer or my next review would be of the Biggest Loser ranch Awesome gelato too.
I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning and I was told they now carry Coca Lite  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US  How great is thatAlso Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries not too shabby huh.
Great value delicious food nice casual atmosphere  But best of all terrific service Our server was busy and someone else noticed and got us started with our order  Excellent team work and very well-managed  Keep up the great job.
Why I haven't written a review for Windsor earlier I'm not sure as I've been going there since it first opened but it's a good one so I guess better late than neverThe owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different numerous options for food Let's start with the interior love it Modern with some natural elements very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk inThe staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing Food wise Omnomnom is all I have to say No the Backyard burger is awesome I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag () Chicken sandwich Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessertbest Butter Pecan I've ever hadThis area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night Check it out.
LOVE LOVE LOVE Stinkweedsit is such a jewel of a record storea true snapshot of culture in PhoenixAND locally ownedso even better.
So I was looking to get a Yoga mat and thought that Dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that  I know this location is brand new as I used to live right near it and literally watched them build it from the ground upThis location has amazing hours  Open late most nights and is right off the expressway  you cant miss it  Its in the same district as Ikea off the I-10Anyways this place is well lit has a ton of parking and is so well organized its not even funny  Not a thing was out of place  It has two floors and carries a ton of stuff  I cruised through the womens section of clothing and they have shoes running stuff you name it its there   I was able to find the Yoga mats and they had a little selection in the back of the store  Did I mention this place is really well litAnyways they had a small variety of mats  They also had a beginner mat set that came with a video a block and a yoga strap  25 bucks  most of the mats I saw were about 20 bucks alone so for the extra 5 bucks I sprug for the extras  I think I got a pretty good dealWhile I was wandering around a staff member asked if there was anything I needed  Just talked to him for a minute about yoga mats and he said that was the only spot in the store that they would be at  Seemed to know his stuffI really like Dick's Sporting goods  Well organized amazing hours well lit friendly staff  I will return in the future.
Great great greasy yummy pizza.
Best diavola EVER I would recommend this pizzeria to anyone it won't disappoint.
I am in love with OTF It's seriously the best workout you can get in an hour I love how it just flys by It's similar to circuit training but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen It helps to push me a little bit harder so I stay in the "orange zone" longer The staff is also super friendly and very responsive I highly recommend checking out Orange Theory Fitness They offer a free trial class as well.
Great staff they make you feel so at home Every medical facility should be this nice Felt like a nice hotel Someone has great taste in decorating Thanks for making us feel at home.
While I don't really buy a whole lot from here I love walking the aisles of bulk goods  They are very reasonably priced especially when it comes to food  A huge bag of spinach for three bucks  A large container of organic raspberries for around four dollars  Yes please  Also we have a kitty with asthma and the vet told me that her prescription would be around $60-$70  Well my deal-finding spidey senses told me otherwise and I stopped at the pharmacy and found that it was only $27 there Win  I also make good use of my Costco membership at the pump because while other gas stations are advertising gas at over three dollars a gallon I was pumping for $299/gal  I like that they have more than just food and house supplies they have electronics a photo developing department movies/dvds/blue ray books flowers personal hygiene items perfumes a cafeteria pet supplies and more.
I have been going to this place for a few years now The food is great it is grilled with light seasoning and goes perfectly with warm flour tortillas You might want to avoid going at lunch time because they are super busy and it is hard to get a seat If you work in the area call ahead and pick it up.
Well well I might as well do the honors and keep the 5 star trend : )I work nearby but I had not noticed this place My friend recommended it for lunch an I was not quite sure of the conceptHowever the staff was super friendly the ingredients look great the pizza was very tasty and to top it off the flavored unsweetened tea was awesome as well ( They had Black tea passionfruit and jasmine/blackberry tea)The pizza crust was very thin and crispy and it cooks really fast The setup us modern the music is upbeat and the prices are very reasonable Daughter had a steak salad and the portion was big and the said it was very tasty My friend had the Hawaiian hubby had the Italian meats or something like that and I went crazy with a custom one Garlic oil little alfredo and little tomato sauce Mozzarela chees and a little feta and little parmesan Pepperoni and Capicola (I didn't even know what capicola was) artichoke mushroom jalapeños red onions black olives and kalamata olivesWe will definitely be back Oh I do not know if they have it but if they don't the only thing that would make this place better is if they have wheat crust.
Hot pink hummus Now you're speaking my language This place is like a delicious choose your own Mediterranean flavor adventure You can get a pita salad or bowl and fix it up the way you want- sort of like Chipotle or Cafe Rio Everything I tried was outstanding I had two kinds of hummus- beet and cilantro The star for me was beet It was slightly sweet and so pretty on the plate- neon pinkThe chicken was tender and flavorful and the bowl had saffron rice which was also a delight The tzatziki sauce had a slight spicy kick which I've never had but ended up really enjoying as well The owner was working the counter and he was so nice I really hope this place does well I'll be back for sure.
We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here the place was packed Never the less the service was impeccable as always This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed I had the 14 Oz NY strip and my wife had the prime rib Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewherecan't vouch as I hate the stuff  From the bread to the desert every bite was worth taking The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red "leather" booths are welcoming It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer it is worth every single cent.
Tott's reminds me of my favorite Chinese eatery in Chicago: Friendship RestaurantEverything tastes fresh and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notchMy favorite menu item for only $625 is the sampler plate Three spring rolls four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce Everything is perfectly cooked with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like springNo MSG Pure vegetable oil Trimmed meats to reduce fat and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooksEasily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona.
Great food in a hole in the wall place  Don't let the atmosphere deter you  We are from SLC Utah and found this place on Yelp It had four tables so is small but well worth it  They had a Mexican telenovela (soap opera) on TV while we were there but it was quiet  We had tacos and huevos rancheros with beans and rice all of the food including salsas were great  To drink we had the Mexican apple soda so tasty  Give it a shot.
This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill  Unfortunely for you I'm a bit more educated than your average diner  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers  First off I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time scheduleYour goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that "Kung Pao" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for meYour comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different  YC's does not specify a serving size  Neither do you  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 05 1 or 2  What does this mean g oz tsp tbs cup  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate   YC's charges 50 cents for a take-out box not $1  I was charged 999 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 899 well then you do the mathYou only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice  I usually rate generously  My initial review was my honest opinion  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.
Wow this is my 100th review  And what a great place to get it  There is a dog park area near the corner of College and Curry with restrooms and park benches  A really nice sized park with some mountain bike trails going through and some nice short hikes as well  Great views of the city if you will climb up a hill and some small ponds you can fish in  Theres so many great areas of this park and they all have different character and atmosphere you cant go wrong.
Green is my absolute favorite place to eat on this earth You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu It's all delicious from the wonderful appetizers to the amazing salads to the entrees with mock meat And don't leave without trying one of the scrumptious desserts Everything is priced very reasonably and that staff is always smiling and helpful I wish I could eat here every day Whether you're a vegan vegetarian or meat-lover try this place out You will NOT be disappointed.
If I could give this place 0 stars I would Want there on Veterans Day for my fathers birthday There was a group of about 15 of us in the bar Only 4 tables in the dinning room with 3 servers and a manager It took us 20 minutes to even get a drink order for me my mother my boyfriend and 20 month old son At that point she was already trying to get a food order from us are you kidding me Got our order in and being a waitress I always ask tables with Kids if they want the kid food to come out first Not only did she not ask his come out lastMom got the brisket I don't know why they even bothered to bring it out You could see the fat just sitting on top Got the salmon which was ok but it was supposed to come with two sides but only got one When I asked about it they aid they would get it Maybe 5 minutes later got my Mac and cheese side Lukewarm at best and the cheese on top wasn't even melted My boyfriend never got one refill on his soda even when he put it to the end of the table Needless to say it was a HORRIBLE experience and I will never be going back.
Worst Breakfast I've probably ever hadI've always been skeptical of places that also cater but this place had 'charm' from the outside Also had some friends RAVE about the hollandaise sauce so I thought I would give it a tryTook the kids for a late breakfast The service was quick and very friendly so a plus thereThe restaurant itself is small and the only 2 clients inside were about 95 years old sitting side by side facing the rest of the restaurant Basically you couldn't sit anywhere without their eyes being on you Granted that's not the owners fault but still weirdI ordered the SW Eggs Benedict It came with a side of "home fries"The Benedict itself consisted of an old and dry biscuit beneath what used to be a frozen puck of chorizo (now completely dry and flavorless) topped by a rather bland hollandaise That wasn't even the worst partThe "potatoes" we're green and mushyHome fries are supposed to be chopped potatoes of the potato color with a delightfully crispy outside They were clearly boiled and then maybe attempted to be pan friedMore about green potatoes: wwwnytimescom/2007/07/03/health/nutrition/03realhtml_r=0My daughter ordered pancakes Pretty sure they were biscuick though I have no proof so it may or may not be so Either way they weren't the best or the worstLastly the musicThey were listening to a Christian radio station It was blatant I couldn't handle it I'm sure others will disagree and that's fine Everyone has the right to their religion and to go where they pleaseThese are just the reasons I won't go back here with my family.
I have been under chiropractic care since 1996 and never have I experienced better results than with Dr Natalie  She has a fantastic personality and takes the time to hear my concerns  I especially like Dr Natalie's holistic approach at the start of each session she verbally checks in to see how your body responded to her last adjustment taking digital notes to track your progress  During the adjustment Dr Natalie attends to your comfort/pain levels while sensing areas of tension in your skeletal/muscular structure  She makes adjustments through a combination of manual manipulations and activation  The phenomenal pre- or post-therapy offered by Dr Natalie's team of massage therapists compliments her fine workI have personally referred three other patients to Dr Natalie in the past four weeks and each of them echoes my sentiments  Whether this is your first or your umpteenth visit to a chiropractor I STRONGLY recommend Dr Natalie.
My wife and I went here on our bi-weekly date night a few months ago I da just gotten back from France and was still feeling good about my culinary experience I was a little hesitant at first to believe that an American place could match the flavors that I enjoyed oh so much while in Paris However Petite Maison far exceeded my expectations I had the dry vac'd steak (I don't remember what it was called but it was the special of the day) and it was "Holy Shit" good After dinner we had some cheese and a glass of wine The cheese was amazing They had all sorts of choices to chose from We had the sampler so we were able to taste something like 6 different cheesesIf you have $75+ and want to have a great meal with your significant other go to Petite Maison You WILL NOT be disappointed  My only complaint was that my meal had to end.
At first most of my noobie friends are very skeptical about the fusion of Chicken and Waffles  but after taking them to this place and experiencing firsthand the divine taste of what they first believe was a anomalous combination it made them change their ReligionFor lunch time I suggest that you get to this place as early 11AM since this place has a very limited sitting you can expect up to 2 hour wait :(.
I did not stay here but I ate here for a Media Breakfast I attended with a professional society that I belong tooI won't comment too much because I know Hermosa Inn is indeed a hotel first but the banquet patio seating they gave us was simply outstanding It was a very gorgeous (and space heater supplied) space with a large center fountain and cafe style table and chairs complete with firepits and lounge seating spread out tooI absolutely loved the flower beds and large stretching trees planting about It was such a sight to see early in the morning The buffet style breakfast they servied was impressive too A large sampling of pastries mini jams muffins yogurt eggs potatoes bacon and sausage I mean we paid $15 each for it and it was well worth itWould go back here for a Sunday morning breakfast before a hike or something It was just so cute and quaint.
The previous reviewer incorrectly said they don't have take out they do  In fact you can get your take-out in one of three ways walk up radio ahead and pick up without even leaving your boat or have it delivered out to your boat in a slipThe marina itself is an excellent facility and very well maintained  The staff goes out of their way to make your time enjoyable and stress-free  Everything we've asked for has been met with a friendly "yes" and just gets taken care of  This is in start contrast to the other marina on the lake which we moved fromThe facility itself is constructed of wood docks over floating platforms  There are excellent and spacious shower and bathroom facilities for the slipholders  Everything is kept well maintained and clean  There is a fuel dock pump-out dock restaurant reasonably stocked store and the marina management office is on siteThe store features the usual boating necessities and some major items like batteries  Prices carry a little bit of the usual on-the-water premium but I've seen far worse  Service is friendly and helpful from everyone involved--managers to fuel attendants.
The food here is a solid 3  But I'm giving them a 5 because of the following reasons: fried rattlesnake appetizer an actual working slide from 2nd to 1st floor (how cool is that) friendly staff kids eat free an absolutely huge steer by the entrance (you'd have to pay $5 at the OC fair to see this) and free cotton candy for the kids.
I have to give this place 5-stars The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey but I feel it's well worth it Windows surround the building to the east and north You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by cars and the light rail The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic upscale part of town They have a lengthy wine and cheese list the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server) However some pairings not suggested may surprise you The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle The cheeses are good though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite and I haven't heard of most of them before going here I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.
MF LegitI didn't know how good they were to me until I moved from Avondale to N Phx They hook up deals and take care of you if you are a regHINT: Plan an extra 5 minutes into your trip they love to shoot the breeze Everyone's chill here.
What a pleasant surprise  I have worked in many fine dining and restaurants that put an emphasis on pairing foods and sauces that compliment each other and being recently transplanted to the Scottsdale area I am very pleased to find this jewel  First this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices because all great food has good to great compliments of wine  I am used to the smaller portions and having many of them my date and I both got the 4 course tasting menu allowing us to sample many of there plates  It was a couple of weekes ago that I dined but standing out still were the endive salad OsaBuco style short rib and an amazing apple and fennel dessert  I was very pleased to have found the Atlas Bistro.
I get my hair done at Salon Moda Fina across the street  I had heard the gals there saying that there was great food across the street but hadn't had the time to stop over beforeOn Saturday October 19 2013 we were staying down the street at The Saguaro for my high school reunion  My husband and I entered (around 10:45 AM) and noticed the "cabin-like" decor  JD greeted us and told us to sit anywhere  We both ordered an iced tea and read the menu  "Lumberjack French Toast" caught my eye immediately  I just remember French toast with whipped cream bananas and candied walnutsthat is all I needed to hear  My husband ordered the Breakfast Sandwich  When my Lumberjack French Toast arrived  my eyes grew very wide open  It was on a large plate and covered with whipped cream  The first thing that I thought I would never finish thatafter the first biteI was delighted  There was also a scoop of walnut vanilla ice cream in the center of all the toast slices  They brought out some syrup but there was no need this dish is great just how it is servedMy husband took one bite of his sandwich and said "we are coming back here for breakfast tomorrow  I finished about half of my food and then asked JD for a box  He laughed as I am sure most people can't finish this item  I sent the other half of my breakfast home with my husband for my teenage son  He loved it even an hour laterGreat atmosphere and JD is very friendly and knowledgeable  We will be back for sure.
Pho Ao Sen is one of the rare Asian restaurants who truly get it--that what draws people is not only having fantastic food (which they do) but also creating the *right environment*  With trickles of water strings of jazz and a comfortably lit and set-up interior it serves basic Vietnamese fare at the basic Vietnamese fare that we have come to expect and love  It's not pretentious by any means but comfortable and welcoming  The food is filling delicious and definitely satisfying.
I have had two experiences with the ER at JCL one to take a good friend in because it turned out he had internal bleeding a week after surgery from another hospital and more recently because my wife had high fever and nausea that was the result we discovered of pneumoniaIt also happened to be this past Valentine's day when the second happenedBoth times the staff did not screw around We were in a room and under care almost immediately The nurse and staff was extremely attentive ran all of the appropriate tests and made an accurate diagnosis that yielded immediate results all of which without a single error or any interaction that I could possibly complain aboutI have a great deal of respect for the medical staff that has helped my loved ones at John C Lincoln and I can confidently recommend their Emergency Room to anyone in need of one(Thank you Karen).
My experience was fabulous I went in with 7 other girls for a bachelorette party not knowing how large and accommodating this place would be When we got there they had a banquet room open and ready and ice bucket for our wine (you can bring your own wine awesome right) and a bottle opener for the wine (thank goodness because we had forgotten one) We had each were going to purchase a travel zoo voucher for an hour massage and 35 minute facial but they said we could just pay as we came in rather than hoping there were enough vouchers available That was super convenient for everyone Even with some of us extending our services we were out of there in 4 hours I wasn't aware that they had such a large staff It was a wonderful experience My massage was fabulous and the therapist took the time to let me know some stretches I can do that will prevent my back from getting tight The facial was amazing too The only thing I can complain about is that when we went to check out the gratuity was automatically 20% of the original cost of the services (not the travelzoo rate) so everyone's bill ended up being twice as much as they were expecting to pay I just wish they would have been upfront with us when scheduling the appointment or when we arrived so that we didn't end such a relaxing session with the shock of an unexpected cost That part was probably on the voucher but because we hadn't purchased one I wasn't aware Either way it was a fabulous deal and my bridesmaid were so impressed with the whole day and intend on setting up follow up appointments with the massage therapist for themselves and their husbands.

Decided to try this establishment on a Friday night and was highly disappointed The food was incredibly bland and over cooked I tried the 'legendary' fried rice with veggies and tofu The tofu was not prepared correctly (read mushy like mashed potatoes) and the only extra veggies were snap peas My husband tried the Thai street noodles It was basically yaki soba noodles with a spice and was clearly not Thai His noodles were so over cooked they were almost crunchy Our server topped the experience off with not knowing how to describe the food and alcohol menu Should have known this place was a bust since there were 3 other patrons dinning Save you self time and money don't bother with this place.
QDOBA on Central Park Central Mall - 9/24/13 Tues @ 11:30 am I was waiting in line for over 10 mins when I finally got to the girl she told we they we out of chicken I don't eat meat or pork so I ONLY wanted chicken I flat out said "Good-Bye" to her & walked out  as I was walking out I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken I was very upset  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken don't you think and the girl was so nonchalant about it too.
I learned of this company through a living social deal I emailed them to set up an appointment The earliest available date was a month later I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time One month went by  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1 NO ONE shows up I wait at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept I've yet to get a response or an explanationThere are many cleaning companies out there my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.
Ever since I moved out to Arizona from LA for school I was looking for a place that did nails well and was not overly priced I tried a couple different places and then I stumbled upon this place I love it the way they do my gel nails makes them last longer than any other place I have been too even in California It isn't super cheap the gel manicure is around $25-$30 but in comparison to some places I have been that is nothing I love this place and I wont go any where else.
The food here was really bland I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews And yes we tried the pizza muffins Maybe I was expecting a real Italian restaurant but it was extremely casual For example the salad is iceberg and the dressing comes in a to-go container with a lid and they use the red plastic baskets for everything  Not what I had in mind I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for great pasta.
First and last time ordering from this dump I live nearby and thought I'd give the place a try and get a carry out order Ordered the Egg rolls 4 per order just ok nothing to write home about Also Ordered the Chicken fried rice and 3 different entrees of chicken The Teriyaki Lemon Grass and Garlic and pepper I actually had to look at the Lids of each carry out order to see what I was eating because they all looked and tasted the same None of them came stir fried with any vegetables just plain strips of dried chicken in their so-called sauce Absolutely Horrible and bland Im not sure what the other reviewers were eating but don't believe them.
Received a coupon in the mail for one-half off of an entree after purchasing one and my wife and I decided to give it a go It's in the neighborhood and we enjoy trying out new restaurants especially mom and pops type of placesQuite simply the reviews below should have sounded off the alarms  First the positives The staff is super friendly and courteous smiling and chatting with you in an effort to make you feel like you're in the East Village (or perhaps in Italy)  The bread (served prior to the meal) was hot and crunchy (but crunchy in a good way) On to the negatives The service is extremely slow We had to ask twice for bread after waiting for about 10 minutes after asking the first time The food was extremely subpar I ordered the "Linguini del Mollusco" which was very oily (you can literally see the grease dripping off the pasta) and absolutely lacking in flavor  I could taste plenty of oil unfortunately The pasta was swimming in grease The "Molusco" element was literally microscopic  I had the smallest shells I have ever seen hardly qualifying this as seafood (unless we are to discuss in molecular terms)My wife had the "Special" which was also Linguine but with chicken and artichokes in the same sort of Chardonnay based sauce Once again oily oily oily  She is extremely picky with her food and could barely muster more than a few bites  If one is starving (as I was after a long day at work) one will eat this food (because ultimately it is still food) but at more than $20-30 per entree it's quite a ripoffTo make matters worse the staff decided to add gratuity to our check  We have been to very classy restaurants (eg at Royal Palms) and we have never had gratuity added to our check (rather than us tipping ourselves) for a party of just 2 At the end of the day with drinks and the coupon we still spent well more than $60 for very bland food with ridiculously slow serviceWe will absolutely not be going back   If you want delicious Italian food may I recommend "Stone and Vine Urban Italian" on Shea Blvd  Their pasta is flavorful their sauces are delicious and their seafood is NOT microscopic (more seafood than you care to have probably).
You would think this is a good place to live then you actually move inMy room was always uncomfortably hot and the A/C would do nothing and if you turned it passed 74 degrees it would freeze and then not work at all it would take hours to defrost and then it would drip a gross amount of water all over your carpet Not only did we have cooling issues but heating as well no heat for a month in the winter The guy would act like we were crazy leave after ten minutes then it would start blowing out cool air They had to call in specialists and one of the workers stole a marc jacobs necklace of mine At first I just assumed I left it somewhere else in the apt and it would turn up (how ever I remember taking it off in the bathroom which is right in front of the ac/heating unit) now I am moved out and it was no where to be found and I only wore it twice so I know I didn't loose it After I moved I sent an e-mail stating what happened and I even said in the email I am not looking for compensation for it I just wanted to inform them that it happened and be a little more aware of the people they hire I got a not very nice e-mail back from the manager to not accuse her employees of that and that it was impossiblethen I explained they had to hire outside works to fix it her response ya so what do you want me to do about it(She completely missed the point)  They have a trash policy that they do not keep up on unless they feel like it I left my trash out for a few minutes while I was moving and they charged me $75which is annoying considering they never enforce it unless they feel like it Also they will sign for a package for you but if someone else picks it up or if the driver doesn't leave it they are not liable for itkinda annoying when you order uggs someone gives it to the wrong apt and your out $14000 I placed a work order the first day to have our carpet fixed because it wasn't installed right and these metal  prongs stick up and poke your foot I placed this work order twice and I'm pretty sure I stepped on it when I was moving out My boyfriend also lived their and they charged him for re grouting a shower if a shower needs to be re grouted that is because the building is old and shouldn't be a $200 charge on his account The pool is constantly littered with people whom don't live there it used to good for college students now there are kids everywhere My roommate dropped her keys off and they claim they never got them so they charged $10700 they also charged us $32000 for a new carpet how ever nothing was wrong with it when we left it only needed to be cleaned which is normal I can go on and on with stories like this but I'm not trying to write a novel here don't be fooled by the pool gym and computer room It's not worth it.
I am obsessed with this "paletas"  I am finding every excuse to drive 36 miles to the Chandler store  I have been there twice and I will be going tomorrow  The first time I was lucky enough to meet the "Betty" of Paletas Betty  She is a cute tiny little thing  So charming  She was so nice and accommodating  I had my soft side cooler with me hey I have twins you cannot imagine what I carry in my cars  Armed with my cooler I got a dozen paletas the first time  I tasted Pineapple con Chili so special  Great pineapple flavor with a great kick from the red pepper chili flakes  The Naranja Orange was delicious I only had a small bite since the twins wouldn't share  My hubby had the Cookies and Cream one another one who wouldn't share  The Cereza (Cherry) was awesome  I really liked the vanilla based ice cream with big cherries all over  Then the piece de resistance the Limon it is like biting into a frozen piece of key lime pie one side of the paleta has the graham cracker crust  So delicious  I had two plus all the other onesMy second trip I got another dozen of course I had a few Limon plus Strawberry Oh this is like fresh strawberries and creme  Those two are my favorite  I also tried the Zarzamora a blackberry/lavender concoction very refreshing  The "Platano" is very good  It is like biting into a frozen caramelized banana  Can't wait for my next trip to Paletas Betty  I already placed my cooler back in the car  Yay.
One of the most reasonable clubs we've been to in Phoenix in terms of pricing  But if it's truly a good club that isn't as big a factor  We got there waaaaay early (right after dinner) but that allowed us to sit and have a wonderful conversation  The club began to pick up around 10 and was pretty full by 11  The music was very dancable the service was timely  Highly recommend it.
so I ordered as usual not allot of waiting from order to window I get to the window and the employee asks me my order slightly annoyed I repeat it and he sass" Your Order Got Deleted" so I pay the $731 Thinking the entire time (being a Ronald McDonald's graduated of 83') Errors like this is an "Automatic Free Meal" Will have to email Corp office on my "Deleted Order".
This customer service line can't get any longer Four registers and one worker really Ive been in line for almost forty five minutes and still haven't been helped Ahhhh This place is so frustrating.
I have only been here once but I cannot wait to go back My favorite part was the atmosphere Cheesecake is awesome the food was so authentic (no Olive Garden menu here) and the owners even went table to table to chat with everyone Very busy but still a great experienceYou should try it at least once Bring cash.
Great place to pull up on yer' Hawg and enjoy a break in your ride All or Most are Discovery channel bikers though Some great bikes to look at if you are in to HD's Great pizza and spicy bloody Mary's If you ride up on yer' sled watch your pipe noise as Cave Creek has an 84 DB limit law and they will write you up.
On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea Very cute store and great personable staffNice selection to baked goods and great tasteWhat nice find in the downtown area I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown North and South is covered for those sudden cravings now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
What a horrible nasty group that runs this little dive They spend their time chasing away people who are seated at the gate - ie customers Horrible  Avoid.
I am SO glad to find this A guy from Mexico I dated took me here and I've wanted to get back but could not remember the name You know  if you're like me- I'm always looking & looking at little hole-in-the-wall Mexican places wondering:  gem food poisoning 6 :00 news "outing" This is in the gem category Be fearless be confident go eat there.
Smashburger has just recently opened and is a quantum upgrade over the restaurant that used to occupy that space I thought I would brave the Friday lunch crowd and try this newly opened restaurant today I got there right before the line started forming 20 deepI had a regular smashburger on an egg bun (without cheese) and a drink for $665 My burger was adorned with mustard sweet relish grilled onions tomatoes and regular red onions (I didn't ask for the red onion but it was good) The food runner even commented on how good that burger looked Well you know what it was Awesome They even have people circling aroung topping off your drinks My only complaint is that they didn't serve the drinks in the "to go" cups I promise to bring back my "restaurant glass" the next time I visit.
We have been going to Mario and Ginger's place for some time and love it  It's a lot of Italy with a family atmosphere and the food is always perfect  We did a family event in their reserve room and the food and service was wonderful  The room has a projector for movies or special events  Going again tonight.
And now ladies and gentlemen the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating Now to preface this review I'm not an idiot I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy maybe taste alright Whoa was I ever wrong to hope for that They group their burgers by how many patties there are starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties) Being a little more on the conservative end I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine he can eat and he doesn't mind a little grease Right as they bring our food out I immediately get intimidated The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either This was beyond unhealthy it was disgusting I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way) It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it Well I'm not impressed I took one bite and was instantly grossed out I actually almost threw up it was so bad My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth" I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts That'd be fine and all except I didn't want to look up these skirts If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place These girls were a little rough around the edges most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach that's not a jokePS I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger DO NOT GO HERE.
Best Japanese restaurant in the Valley  The service and food are always impeccable.
Great coffee shop free wi-fi great service Can't ask for much more Atmosphere is nice and cozy and quiet  Lots of people studying here I think  Not me though :o)  Has outdoor seating too  Too hot in summer maybe but great in winter.
I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across It's practically a hobby for me For YEARS I kept saying "I want to go to Cowboy Ciao" but we never made it Then thankfully the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there so we just HAD to go (Thank you hubs' best friend)I have to say that the service was incredible and the menu was almost overwhelming There were SO many interesting choices but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad and I wasn't about to miss out The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank The chopped salad has earned its reputation That thing is de-freaking-licious The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well but I couldn't get over how great the salad was AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty Seriously can it get any betterFor dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON.
This place rocks  Went in the other day and tried the Mushroom burger super tasty you can pile the toppings high as you like  The onion rings are pure goodnessVery friendly staff just be patient as it takes a few minutes to prepare.
I believe this is the bigger of the 2 shops here in the valleyThey even have a cafeso for those of you who miss Boarders This is just as nice  Huge parking lot in mesa also very busy place                                        They really do have any type of book that you could want  Tapesvideos Dvdsgames for all sorts of players    The housewares dept is also quite good with huge amounts to choose from        The staff is friendly as well   As Michalel said it is also great to be a part of the recycling             You can take in all sorts of things for trade as well The trade is better than the cash                                                                                                        When you need anything in the media dept this is the place to go.
Delicious frozen yogurt I had a coupon and tried like 5 different flavors with some almonds for a topping It was awesome Apparently it's not even bad for you so I didn't feel guilty afterward Yum.
This event was a great way to start off the new year  We didn't so much screw our resolutions as we aired them for all the restaurant to see starting some good conversations  I loved meeting a few new Yelpers and getting to know others a little betterSalty Sow is comfort food meets sophisticated dining  Appetizers were truffle deviled eggs and a salmon/cracker crudité that were a tasty tip of an awesome iceberg  Dinner was served on their family dining table buffet style  Pork shoulder pork ragout Brussels sprout salad beef tenderloin and assortments of veggies sprawled the table and required at least 3 plates for most of us  Everything was fabulous and my fresh sangria complimented the spread perfectly The service was as good as the food  We met the GM and chef partners in Salty-crime  All of the servers were attentive friendly and willing to share tips on the menu It was a great night for sureBig shout out to Salty Sow for opening their doors to us for our first Elite event of the year  Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp for the opportunity and for the awesome new nail files.
This was my first destination every morning for about 2 months straight in summer 2010  Sucker for the Pomagranite Pick Me Up the workers at this location are all nnice.
Ohhhhhh where to begin Jenn is amazing I was referred to her by a friend and now I know why She is honest experienced and such a sweetheart I am very particular with my hair (as it is a hot mess and always a nightmare to deal with) and she can conquer it with flying colors  Looking for a new stylist You found your girl right here.
I wanted to hate this place  There isn't that much parking  It is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat  It was to hot to eat outside IMO which meant I had to take my sandwhich to go  There were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from  One dessert they were sold out of  The price was high- $8 for a sandwich with no sidesHowever once I took my first bite of the tomatoe basil mozzarella sandwich I was in HEAVEN  The perfect amount of each ingredient  They have perfected the sandwich  I have been craving it ever since  I will stop by for lunch EVERYTIME I am in the area  I will bring everyone I know to eat here  Seriously.
Such a great place to spend a night drinking a beer or glass of wine with close friends  Yummy food great servers.
If you're thinking to yourself "aw man it's just mexican food there are a thousand mexican restaurants in Phoenix" stop whatever you're doing come to Tacos Atoyac and try some awesome authentic mexican food  This place is unassuming in a "blink-and-you'll-miss-it" kind of way but do not judge this book by its cover  Try it love it.
A year before we married my husband and I had the distinct pleasure of visiting with Mary Lou a few months before her death in 2010  We toured her lovely castle and had distinct images of her life as a child on the stone floors looking at the stone walls covered with eclectic mis-matched pieces of her life  I admired her for the child like wonder that was still in her eyes  Unfortunately 3 years later when we took my son to the castle he couldn't meet this wondrous soul for himself  I highly recommend making this a "must see" stop if you are ever in the area  It is an artist's play land and being a poet I could find the beautiful imagery in every nook and cranny  I look forward to going back again some day soon.
This place is Great  I took my family there Sunday morning to watch some football and eat breakfast/lunch  The atomsphere was good and the food was awesom I know it is an Italian place but I had an omelette with green pepers onion ham and cheddar  It was unbelieveable and I am guessing it had at least 4 eggs Kid friendly for football as well  I would go there again and probaly will on Sudnay.
Was in the area so my friend and I came here for lunch  I ordered the Korean dish bi bim bap  It was sooo good  Just like my mom makes it  The only difference is the red chili paste sauce they give you is far less spicy then it would normally be  They modified to satisfy those who are not used to the "ethnic hot" as I like to call it  I wish they had a location closer to me  I crave the food here all the time.
I had a flat tire twice in one week (my kind of luck) on two different tires and went here and had the most top  notch service and the most helpful and accommodating staff at any discount tire I have ever been to  I would recommend this location and the way this staff treats the customers to be the example of training for all other stores  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes each time no charge as I had the insurance and just really very happy.
This place is quite amazing I cannot believe I never knew it was here beforeMy girlfriend is crazy over growing our own food However we live in the city not the country so we really cannot do it She is certain that we can and willSo when we came back from Italy last time I bought 5 fruit treesThe AZ type of fruit lemon orange cumquat etcI ended up by taking back the grapefruit tree because I had no where to plant itWe ran out of spaceThen we found this place wonderful trees of all sorts Now she is on a roll we have to move or fill our entire land with trees I am guessing we have to move I think we have no room for more trees at the moment but when we do this is where we will be going for sureIf nothing else this place is educational Lychee trees evenI think she wants an avacado treeit reminds her of living in Hawaii.
Best fajitas outside of Mexico  Fantastic service and great prices.
A Salon Experience as it is meant to be  Excellent service and exceptional stylists  Ask for color specialist Sarah.
So I started shopping here after being scared to death from watching Food Inc  (Thanks Oprah)  Anyways of course Whole Foods has many nicknames regarding how expensive they are but if you haven't heard of any here are a couple of themWholey Moley Foods and Whole Paycheck I shop here every week for organic items and for all my grocery needs  I have yet to find a store with this selection and yes I will pay extra to not have to go to extra stores just for the convenience  (No I'm not independently wealthy)This store has the best selection out of the other Scottsdale store and the Tatum store  However I have found that the Tatum store seems to have a better selection of produce when I go as it doesn't seem to be picked over as bad as this one Why do I give it 5 stars  The store is clean the staff is friendly it promotes organic farming and they have" Bret Michaels" for a cashier.
A variety of delicious beers friendly staff and a not too busy atmosphere What more could you want Oh you're hungry Yeah well there's a food truck outside too This tasting room is seriously the only thing from our whole weekend in the Phoenix area that made me sad that I'm not a localWe came in the night before the Rock and Roll Half Marathon with the intent of having a beer each and then ended up trying pretty much everything they offer because it was so affordable everything was tasty and we just didn't want to leave I drank MANY IPAs over the years I lived in Seattle and I think their American IPA is one of my favorites - heavy on the hops without being too citrusy I definitely woke up the next morning thinking I should have had more water and less beer the previous evening but beer has carbs which must be good for running rightThey had a couple of TVs and tons of board games along with a little outside area to sit We opted for outside and because it's in a business park it was super quiet which was perfect and not what you expect for going out on a Saturday evening for a beer Four Peaks you're my favorite thing in all of Arizona for sure.
Some of the worst customer service you will ever receive Do not go here unless it is an absolute emergency and even then try to find someplace else The worst the worst THE WORST There is ONE employee who is actually helpful an older gentleman no one else will feel compelled to help you at all DO NOT SHOP HERE.
First of all great produce delicious fresh and a great selection Thinking about them makes me hungrySecondly ease of ordering starting service and changing orders -- their web site is easy to useThirdly great attitude superb customer service  Highly recommended.
Oh Rhythm Room how I adore theeI have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play I definitely try to make it  They are rockin'  I dig the dancing the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floorI do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start  I always have a great time here  And now that you can't smoke it's even better.
Trunk space books fabulous Indi bandsI can still remember back when JRC and Steph were vending coffee out of Paper Heart Gallery when it was on Van Buren Now they have a venue that is lifeblood of Phoenix I have seen amazing bands here too many to mention and really bad local comedy and both were well worth the cover chargeThe art shows curated here are always impressive as well This is a good place to really be in Phoenix.
I am done with the Armitage I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced the food and service was always good A couple of months ago we went there for a birthday lunch I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita How can one mess up a veggie sandwich How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments especially since I wasn't the one paying A couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender on the medium rare side I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said "that's how it's made" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits No comment from the server I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid My partner's "medium-well" burger was very well done She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain do we We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed since we didn't see him until the end of the meal At that point we made it clear that we were very disappointed and showed him the doneness of the burger I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp We settled on a free dessert He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time To the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before and that there is now something wrong have your people pay attention Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen However based on what your staff said IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order then you have no business in the food business If not then you better get in that kitchen and fix it because this sort of news travels fast in my community In my book two strikes and you are out Sorry but there are better choices out there and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good You're just not good anymore I will not be back.
Unbelievably good calzone  I've been looking for a good one all over the metro area  This one's the real deal  Great wood-burning stove and delicious crust  Thus the name.
Excellent Southwestern Food  As good or better than Richardsons  I say better.
Yum Yum Yum  Your own custom personal pizza in minutes  Loved the crust loved the selection of toppings and the customer service was great.
Nobody greeted us or asked if we needed help Spencer's has the same prices but brand new appliances.
After a couple more visits I deem this place the Walmart of sushi The past few times I have gone it takes FOREVER to get a seat Then it takes a bit to get your drink and its a bother to ask for a refill When you want your check - that takes FOREVER too You would think they would be on top of that and try to get people in and out faster The sushi is just okay and I now would rather spend a little more for great customer service and better quality sushi If you do decide to go take a peek at the floor surrounding the sushi making station Disgusting It looks like what you would find underneath a refrigerator.
I try to not give out 2's and 1's for ratings but I really can't stand Pappa Johns  Do yourself a favor and pay a few bucks more for some good pizza  If you insist on greasy chain pizza Hungry Howies is the only choice.
Bad food expensive not worth the moneyI got a to-go of falafel starter and 2 chicken  combo platter and i regret spending $ 35 on this tasteless meal The pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the foodWill prefer Greek Wraps/King Gyros to this place which are economical and tasty.
The cookies are about the only good thing about this place The service is outrageously bad A friend and I ordered lunch- just some sandwhiches and it took over 30 mins After telling the waitress that we needed to rush things with the check she took even longer forcing us to go to the front of the restaurant to payThe manager is always courteous and thoughtful but his staff is always terrible On the few other occasions I have eaten there my order is always incorrect Huge waste of time if you are looking for a speedy lunch.
I order over the phone tuna tataki 3hand roll and asked if 2california 1spicy tuna and tempura vegetable it took over 40 min wen my husband picked it up I couldn't believe the hand rolls were the size of a felt pen and the paper sea weed crumble in my hand He had charge us 4700 so I call and told him he said he would correct and give us back like 1500 that he charge to much so another half hour later we get back the 3 rolls the only one that was right was tuna the other two I don't know no California hand roll the last 3time I Was there it was again over price and did not get for my money I'm done going therenot worth it.
This place is horrible The service is second rate and the estimates are through the roof A poorly run company by poorly organized people.
Service ApocalypseTo the feather flying' fedora-wearing I'm-going-to-wear-a-vest-and-long-sleeves-even-though-it's-still-hot-out and-it's-not-1922 hipster server:Go to your local library Pick up some literature on proper etiquette Might I suggest Emily PostUh Oh  Too much text for your weary hipster eyes Spent all day giving customers the stink-eye didn't you OK I'll break it down for you:1 When people sit down at a table try to greet them If you're super tied up between checking up on other tables and checking your appearance in the mirror then maybe just let that table know that you are busy and that you will be with them shortly Because after we were seated at our table almost 10 minutes went by - no waiter nothing We were beginning to get worried We thought perhaps you had been kidnapped We called the authorities but we had little information to go off of since you never came by and said "hi" We described you as a tall malnourished hipster wearing teen-girl skinny jeans an overwhelming ensemble of man accessories and air of mismatched cocky arrogance for a 30 year old dude at the lower end of the service industry Unfortunately that description did us no good in the neighborhood of CenPho  but luckily when we were just about at our wits' end you showed up hunched over scowl on your face (if this is in preparation for your costume as a zombie you are rocking it)2 When you serve people drinks let them finish said drinks before hastily removing them from the table If they kindly ask you for their drinks back try not to be an ass 3 When customers order dinner try not to take so long so as to confuse them into thinking it's breakfast 4 When the food is served maybe don't go MIA Maybe check back in with them Maybe they want dessert for  wait what time is it now lunch  OK I'll stop there I know how valuable time is to the pretentious staff at the Windsor Those cigarettes aren't going to smoke themselves Well congratulations From now on we will avoid your restaurant like you avoid a real job.
While the beans are tasty as other reviewers have said (they use lard in them mmm mmm) and the portion sizes generous I just can't recommend you eat here based on the fact I found out they fry their nachos and probably by extension other things using the fryer in hydrogenated oil You can "feel" it on the nachos as they have a waxy coating when cooledI know not everyone knows or perhaps cares about the deathly spectre of hydro-oils (most commonly referred to as trans fats) but believe me: they're highly dangerousIt's a damn shame too as most of the offerings at this place seem solid and they even have three-person mariachi bands at the ready to serenade you In my short time in PHX this looked like it was going to be the best Mexican place I had found yet Oh well back to the drawing board.
Since the changed menu yuk Will not return.
My boyfriend and I grew up on Serrano's living in Tempe It had been years since we have been so we figured we would stop in for happy hour I cant believe how badly this place has gone down hill Though there was only a few tables of people in the whole place we decided to sit at the bar in hopes of faster service Upon sitting down there was dirty dishes left on the bar that looked like they had been there awhile The buser quickly came over and cleaned up and brought us chips and dips (he was probably the most attentive person in this place) We had to flag the bar tender down to get drinks (mind you there was only 2 other people at the bar) The drinks were horrible No Tabasco on hand for a bloody Mary and no oranges for the blue moon they have on tap really you have Blue Moon on tap and no oranges I had to ask the bartender 3 times for a water the last time she said "ya sure" then walked in back for 5 minutes The fourth time my boyfriend finally asked her for my water and had her remake me something to drink as the bloody Mary was unbearable We then had to ask for menus and also had to ask her to take our order I mean what is your job if I as the customer am doing all the work The manager brought our plate out it was cold The food was mediocre at best what a disappointment especially for the price My boyfriend asked the bartender for silverware which she said "oh yeah sure" then walked off and did something else I told him not to even remind her and see if she will ever bring it Nope we ended up sharing silverware We spoke with the manager when we left about how poor the service was he didn't seem to care much just staring at us with a blank expression So that is if for us we will not be back So sad that we use to love this place and it has gone down the drain so much.
Perhaps if I were "hammered" I would have enjoyed this meal better I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot I ordered take-out on a Sunday and when I arrived I felt something was off right away The place was dead Not one person in the gigantic dining room only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored The bar however was pretty lively maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food Ribs - all char and fat barely any meat and extremely overcookedPulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of greaseThe sides corn (half a cob is considered a side for two) Cheese grits worst I have ever tried dry and flavorlessCornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry spongeBBQ Sauce - disappointing at best watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides)Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on topI really don't like writing scathing reviews but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix this is not one.
Bad hotel coffee shop  Food is just bad Service slow inatentive and poorly trained  They are cluelessAmbiance is terrible insidewe were there at nightduring day can sit outside in pool garden areawhich I'm sure is prettyand drinks are very thinorder beer or wine   Do not go unless your staying in hotelit makes a very poor statement about marriot At desert ridgenot worth wasting time on reviewing.
Waste of money Pizza was cold Ordered carry out & had to wait 5 minutes for someone to help me while my pizza sat in the window getting cold Pizza was cold the toppings were skimpy & they shorted my order of chicken poppers which were gross anyway Wouldn't order from here again.
I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place  It was terrible  The service was slow I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it  Would not recommend.
Me and my partner has been bringing our adorable dog here since she was a pup and every time it has been pleasent except for today Usually one of the nice girls cleans and trims our dog's nails and never once has there been an issue but today some guy done her grooming and when we got in the car her nails look like they were butchered and she still smells the samejust for future reference they have lost my business.
I wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house  Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed with the quality of the cupcakes  I bought a variety to try them out  First and foremost there is WAY WAY WAY too much frosting on these cupcakes  So much that it was gross - I like sweets but wow - this would put you in a diabetic coma even if you don't have diabetes  There was at least 4 times more frosting than cupcake   The actual cake is so small - like half a cupcake - and not very good  I have had better cupcakes from a box that I make at home  One of the cupcakes was also old and stale - it was the last one left of this flavor and I should have known better than to purchase it  The salesperson should NOT have sold this cupcake either and she had to have known it had been there a while - and she sold it to me anyway - I am sure just to get rid of it  I will say the marketing of GiGi's is very clever and the packaging and presentation is really cool as well - but I want to eat and enjoy a cupcake not just look at how pretty and cool it looks  Not worth $350 each and I will not be back.
Owner is crazy actually really like the food there (veggies that is) but won't ever go again  I've never felt so uncomfortable or offended as I did the last time I visited this place  I could write a book about this experance but really is there a need  Clearly I'm not the only one  Owner was rude.
Very disappointing After reading the great reviews posted by others I purchased a groupon for 5 visits Needless to say I will not be making a trip back The idea is nice but the construction of the little town is very poor and in need of a face lift and new carpeting It was packed with kids but there seemed to be very few toys in site My daughter went to play in the little grocery store but instead of baskets of fun fake food there was nothing in there but a broken plastic cash register Everything looked worn and dingy and we left after about fifteen minutes.
Was in Phoenix and wanted to Yelp a local place since I always have great luck with YelpI was staying in downtown and was happy to see that I would be able to walk to this restaurant that had such great reviews It was 'Open' on Yelp so I walked over there STARVING only for it to be closed WTH Seriously if you have your business on this site and have gone through the trouble of adding your hours they had better be correctVery upset that I could have chosen so many other places major boo boo.
so i walked by this place a few weeks ago and noticed a sign 'closed temporarily due to family illness' okcool whatever  Yesterday walked by again and saw an eviction notice on the door a cowrker and I decided to be nosey and looked in the windows the whole place had been gutted out I guess the family illness was no customers.
WARNING  EXTREMLEY RUDE EMPLOYEESIf i could give a half or quarter star i would  But one star is the only optionYou wouldnt beleive how the staff treats you here Completley unprofessinal and these guys have no idea what the word Hospitality means BTW no part of my story is inflated or exagerated Everything is right onCame out to Tempe to watch the Angels spring training games Saturday the 21st of March around 430pm after the Angels and brews game we headed back toward our hotel and stopped by this place to give them a go i go inside with my buddy and his fiance I ordered first got the cheesesteak hoagie togo once he hands it to me i asked if i could get a side of ranch he grabs it and as he hands it to me he asks  "are you putting that on your sandwitch" I replied with a Yes He then rolls his eyes and gives me a huge sigh Then he actually tells me that if he'd known it was for the cheesesteak he would have never given it to me Excuse me I just paid you  $10 for a hoagie and your going to stand there and tell me how to eat my cheese steak My friends and I are completley blow away by the way this guy is talking to me very unprofessinal By this point  he's standing behind the grill and has stopped cooking even though he had orders there and begins to get into a verbal confrontation with me Looks toward my friend and Starts yelling at him as well Then the indigent looking Cashier comes by to back is patron up completley oblivious to whats been happening The funny thing here is that  back at the room I'm telling my brother about what happened he just begins to laugh and he tells me he was there friday day and the exact same thing happened to him Thats not it though this happened to my friend the night before because he didnt hear them calling his name to pick up his hoagie   Well that friend ended up walking in to use the bathroom and gave me a higfive the guys look at him and tell me they were yelling at him last night because he forgot his cheesesteak It seemed as though they were trying to backpeddle and use him as an excuse to why they where being complete douchbags toward my self and friends But he didnt even know i knew him till he gave me the high five as he walked in I though it be best to walk out side and just leave things the way they where I was obviously not getting anywhere with these guys Now the hoagie was good I've never had it with wiz and i have to say i enojy it a bit more than with the provelone So Sandwitch good But incompetent employees BAD  And its sad to say this but Corleones will never see my money AGAIN    Even if you had the best cheesesteaks in the world pissing off your guests isnt a good thing for business Funny i have two friends that work at Tavern and Another a zuma And a waiter at La Bocca  They all told me I'm not the first to be treated this way I know im not local but you never know who your talking to Angry cook dont get to comffy at this place I say give an education another try cause you didnt seem to bright as is Cashier shave your beardyou look homeless  Corliones Great cheesesteak but that was my first and last one.
I just hung up 21 mintues on hold no one came to the phone The first call my phone died after 6 minutes on hold I promptly  called back on my house phone (for the younger generationa house phone is a handheld phone that plugs into the wall)20minutes (and counting) on hold to place a take-out during a non-rush hourFine you lost a customer today next time I will bring my awful kids and they will clear your restaurantI have to add this I didn't get to place the orderMy husband went in and guess what he called me from JD and tells me the store was EMPTY and they didn't receive any calls Bull crap I have recordsWhile writing this update my husband walks in and he tells me it was the MANAGER that said no one called the store uhhh 2 times 1st time was a young man and the 2nd time was a young girlHusband said there was a young man next to the manager that had a "look" on his face he knows we called.
Worst ice machine on the planet  I wanted hot peppers on the side not on my sandwich  Was refused  Corporate Policy WTF  Lost me as a customer  No one dictates how I want my sandwich made.
Wow  If it was possible to give a place negative stars I would have  I purchased a gift certificate for this restaurant on restaurantcom  My husband and I took our three small children there on Saturday night  The hostess looked annoyed that she had to seat us  Once at the table three waiters passed us by without asking what we wanted to drink etc  Once we had been there for about 6 minutes a bus boy brought us some salsa  He asked if we knew about the salsa and I said no we hadn't eaten there in years  His response was "oh it's the same" which didn't explain anything at all  We continued to sit for another 10 minutes or so with no drinks and thirsty children as waiter after waiter passed us by  The table that got seated 30 seconds before us got their food and we still hadn't been served even a glass of water  At this point we left  On my way out I decided I should talk to a manager  The bartender got him for me  As he was coming to the front he refused to make eye contact with me and actually passed me right by and was chatting with the hostess at the station  When I said "excuse me" he turned and said "yeah"  I explained to him what happened and that we were leaving and his response was to turn to me gesture to the restaurant and say "the restaurant is full you think you make a difference  I have never been so insulted in my life  I would never return to this restaurant and I would never ever recommend it to anyone  What a disaster  The customer sevice sucks the manager is an ass and the entire experience was a total joke.
Water is shut off at first monthly then biweekly now weekly and off for hours No notice is given Pools look terrible green with algae never are the two pools open at the same time Over this past summer the pools were closed on a weekly basis One may be open for a few days and then locked up again for another few days to a week The washer/dryers on each floor has at least one of them broken or one of each broken Management in the office never seem to know what's going on but one of the ladies she is a sweetheart Maintenance NEVER come by when they say they are your lucky if it's the same week you called Elevators are always broken or need repairs guests are always stuck in them for an hour to hours long Fire department has been called a few times to open/help the ones stuck in them Our AC was shut off for 1 1/2 days during 110° days If yours want to live here it's at your own risk the hassle is not worth the headache.
We had dinner there last evening 1/22/14  Service was very good from our server who was from Sicily   Foodnot so much although the spinach salad with goat cheese was excellent  Having just returned from Italy we were hungry for more of what we experienced in dining  We had gnocchi with a walnut sauce that was horrid and inedible gray sauce with potato lumps pretending to be gnocchi  The Orecchietta w/sausage pasta was tough and not cooked properly and the red sauce which was suppose to be a pepperoncino spicy sauce appeared to be the bland drain off a can of tomato sauceWe did not stay for dessert.
I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality its one of the worst I've ever been in and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the dayYes Majerle's is worse  Okay well no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of HellThe set up is terrible  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS () at one time they are both showing the same game  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games  Moreover i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch  The bar is always crowded which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible foodI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1000 sports bars in the US.
I went off the grid and ordered something they are possibly not known for the chicken ceasar wrap  I was insulted by what I got for paying I believe 6 dollars for  When I looked inside of it their may have been the collection of a small chicken leg as far as the portion of meat it did not exist  The entire thing was stuffed with iced berg lettuce  The cost of this piece of crap may have been a dollar a mark up up 5 dollars thanks  I left hungry and unsatisfied never again  QT and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper.
My friend and I came in some weeks ago about end of August after attending a funeral service on that side of town  The service was overall bad and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend  So we flagged down the manager to complain  The result was that he explained that the district manager was there and the ice machine was doneI was like thinking my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me but oh well they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotionWhen we checked out it took 1/2 hour to pay the bill in addition NO Pieces of Pie were comped out Explanation -- the types of pie we chose were not in the free offer although we had asked the server about the time limit on the free pie I guess he would not let us in on the secret that the TYPES we chose were not free and now in addition to NOT getting comped as a nicety for the arguing we weren't even given ANY free pie at all  They gave us ONE free $2 iced tea  And TOOK an extraordinary long time to do this  We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad lolOverall I would avoid this location  There are plenty of other restaurant choices nearby when I am on this side of town.
This pet store was closed long ago Needs to be removed.
Wasn't happy with the serviceor lack of  It wasn't everyone (thank you to young lady that asked if I wanted anything and the one who apologized) but one specific server who made the experience negative  In the area visiting but I know I won't go back to this location.
Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu  My fav Barbecue chicken saladno longer has a hint of the same taste It should now be called flavor of tomato  Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor Im sure many people will love these new changes  Yet Im sad it's not the same I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich No joking.
SmellyLoudPretentious for no good reason at allOverpricedBut the worst thing for someone like me as a vegetarian is that there are perhaps two items on the entire menu from which to choose  I don't mind macguyvering a meal out of the appetizer section but come on All you have is tofu or edamame No thanks.
One star for their great service Food was the worst BBQ ever horrible ribs were rare  Yes pink stuck to the bone not done threw them away   Expensive and horrible food.
I went for my first time today and ordered a barbacoa burritoIt made me sickConsCold tortillaCold and Flavorless barbacoaBeans tasted like plastic bottle capsSalsa had a weird taste  ProsThe little red tray where they put your burrito onThe guacamole I know it's fast food but I just don't find what's so exciting about this placeThere are better places here in the valley that serve delicious Mexican food for the same price.
Had wanted to check this place out for awhile since It is a Packer Bar and they were supposed to be known for their green chile cheeseburger  - Walked in and almost every table was reserved for the game so it was a good atmosphere if you are a Packer fan and that is where the highlights endedIt took about 30 minutes to get a beer when i initially asked about the order she stated she was getting to it and then proceeded not to come back to the table for another hour  we ended up going up to the bar to make future orders after that instead of waiting for the waitress (however that issue was solved after the 1st Quarter perhaps they were short staffed) Ordered their famous Green Chile burger and fries and got raw fries and a burger burnt to a crisp was pretty unedible however the green chile could hide the burnt taste to get a couple bites downBeers are cheap here - certainly eat before you come here will not be making a return visit pretty disappointing.
Gross plain and simple  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset  What a waste of money.
Avoid this office altogether  Too many things wrong to list i have been to dentists offices before and after not requiring fillings this office said that i needed 3+ of them  after declining fillings on the visit the front desk person then proceeded to negotiate my out of pocket coinsurance in an effort to encourage me to do the service that day (which i declined and just had a cleaning) i advised her that to my knowledge negotiating coinsurance was not legal because of my previous insurance work experience 5 months later i receive a bill (not past due) with not explanation of services  This office is ethically questionable AVOID.
My experience here was awful  The staff acted like we were lepers due to a Groupon and nobody seemed to be able to figure out what the Groupon was offering useven though it was in black and white  The manager was there but completely refused to come out to assist the clueless staff in any way  There was an obvious training issue as the staff stood around like zombies trying to figure out what was going onone after another  I decided to continue through and try the food  Another complete disaster a beautiful looking piece of salmon completely overcooked and ruined  The chicken also resembled a hockey puck  Returned the food barely eaten and did not even want to give the "chef" another opportunity to ruin more food on my behalf  Even after all of this the poor bartendernice guy despite being put in a terrible position by his obviously incompetent managertold me that the manager was just too busy to come out and address the situation  Good effort to right a wrong by the bartender weak managing  Maybe the manager was simply worn out from addressing complaints  Never ever again.
I would never in my life eat here When I was there for their nighttime activities and people were throwing up I couldn't help but thinkwhy oh why would anyone want to eat here No offense but it was dirty and seemed like a sleazy place where younglings hang out to behave like they would in Mexico And how are girls supposed to get dressed up for a place that literally has a floor made of dirt This would be one of my last options if I wanted to go out Especially since I don't drink beer and that seems to be there most popular special I did go to the one in Chandler though and it was soooo much cleaner I liked that one much more.
AVOID MEAT DEPARTMENTBad Service Poor quality seafood and meatsManager does not offer any helpGood Produce sale on WedDo not expect any customer service from Meat Dept and Store Manager.
If you advertise Price Matching you should HONOR itI came in on December 22 to purchasee two items that happend to be cheaper at BevMo by $2 each  Not that big of a deal but the manager refused to honor the price match until he confirmed on his computer that the price was valid in Arizona  Seriously showing him on my phone the live website was not good enough  What a waste of my time and everyone behind me in line  I paid the full price to avoid delay but I will not shope here again and I will continue to shop at BevMo  BevMo has MUCH better customer service and honor their price matching policyAdditionally they were out of stock of one of the items that I was looking for  Which only added to my frustrations.
This place is a staple lunch spot for us I have rated this place highly before Today an order mix up became a very uncomfortable situation Really too bad.
must be out of business  The number is disconnected  bummer  I need a gardener.
First I have to say that the food is decent I wish you could review differently for food v service Have you ever been to a restaurant where you feel like you are an inconvenience just by virtue of the fact that you are a customer The staff here is RUDE and no courteous at all The food is awesome and that is why I went there but they really nickle and dime you I ordered the vegetarian burrito and I was told that adding veggies ( TO THE VEGGIE burrito) was more than a dollar extra Another couple said they were overcharged for their chips and salsa The cashier told me that they now keep all of the hot sauce behind the counter because customer will take it Next time I will stick with good ol' Chipotle.
I had Isabel's come clean my house before the holidays and was very unhappy with the work that they provided They advertised up to 4 hours of deep cleaning and it looked as if they had spent 10 minutes in my house When they arrived I agreed to pay and extra $40 to have the baseboards fans and oven cleaned and when I returned the only thing that was done was the oven I called to complain and to ask for a refund for a Weekly Deal I had purchased as a gift for my sister in law because after the work that they had done I wouldn't even gift their services to my worst enemy I sent 3 emails and have never received a return response PLEASE don't hire this companyspend your money elsewhere.
Horrible company that has to blow up the job posting section on Craigslistorg YOU DO NOT NEED TO POST IN EVERY SECTION TO FIND SOMEONE TO WORK FOR YOU In fact that shows that you really dont care who gets the job as long as theyre willing to work for your low pay and drive to Peoria A company that is THAT desprate for employees is NOT somewhere I One would want to work and Two somewhere I would take my vehicle ANNOYING.
I will never ever return back here again Over charged me and I almost puked when they brought out my soggy greasy sourdough bread burger out  Plus soda machines were out and still got charged for my disgusting drink I honestly can not believe I didn't just get my money back and walk out If you love burgers hit up  fat burger 3 miles down the road.
I was actually really disappointed I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose so you're not necessarily going for the foodBut the cleanliness was horrible I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of childrenOur waiter was a great help and super nice but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was "Don't worry about it we have someone on it"  I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way Don't think I'll be making another trip back anytime soon.
A sporadic text message from my friend had me wondering what to have for lunch Before I could figure it out he was already ready to go So I turned on the GPS on my phone and found a place nearby on Yelp I really hesitated to go here and was so close to insisting on Chipotle instead However I figured I would give NYPD another shotI rarely leave food unfinished even if its mediocre But the wings that came with the lunch special were so bad that I just could not finish them If there wasn't any hot sauce I probably would have vomited Did they decide to just take week old wings and serve them I am incredibly disappointed I seriously have never had wings as bad as NYPD's in my entire lifeThe pizza slice was ok but seriously why bother selling stuff that is just plain terrible I'm really going to hesitate coming back here In fact I probably wouldn't come here even if a friend invited me for lunch and paid for it One of my worst experiences ever.
I ordered the teriyaki chicken which is apparently their specialty and priced accordingly  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy  Even still this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out  Nasty.
I was hoping for a great cheeseburger Unfortunately the burger was not good I prefer In and Out Burger  It was greasy tasteless and expensive Yuk.
Hey we know what we're getting with Filiberto's cheap Mexican grub in large quantities Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice this location definitely isn't one of them  The dining room was dark grimey and dingy the tables are too high for the bench seats and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down What a waste of a meal.
Very disappointing morning  Wanted a great breakfast but instead received NO service  Waited 10 minutes to get waited on - and nobody came over to even say hello  The place was not busy - 5 tables of people with over 5 staff available  Had to leave after nobody could even say hello  Sorry to saywon't be back.
OKAYSoI've tried this place twiceFirst time was the Saturday before Easter Sunday I understand they were extremely busy because of Easter I didn't mind waiting an hour prior to being seated because I understood I was a walk-in I was also speaking with another customer who said she's been coming here for like 10 yrs or so I admit I was impressed and wanted to try their service I tried their Deluxe Spa Pedicure - includes anything in the spa pedicure plus sea salt treatment callus eliminator cooling gel hot towel and French tip or design $37 I enjoyed the treatment though the wait and it was super relaxingno conversation as the workers seemed overworked tired and ready to jet for the door mind you it was 720pm and one of the male workers brought in a $5 pizza from Little Ceasars a few doors down Anywhotoday was my 2nd visit I went it wanting that relaxing pampering treatment from before since I felt I deserved to treat and give myself a break from work kids and running errandsI signed in at 450pm I was told to pick out a color etc I was seated in less than 10 minutes I thought "Awesome Faster than before"  I literally sat there cross referencing my calendar paid bills made appointments for my kids etcI realized my toes were like prunesAND 58 minutes had passed byoh no I am normally a patient person IF customer care is addressed But since no one checked on me offered me a magazine water etcI got impatient and quickly very UN-impressed from the first experience and despite what others have said I say this because there were three other women in there besides me This was a first for me to walk out on a business I literally took my pruned soaked toes out of the water and walked out So instead of a relaxing rejuvenating experienceI was upset and highly disappointed    I will not be returning and am still in the need of a relaxing experience and great nail salon I'll pay my $37 pedicure and 20% tip elsewhereCiao.
This McDonalds is one of the worst I have ever been to There are always transients outside begging for money Many of them approach you at your car or follow you out of the building The food is decent but the line is always long The staff has little common sense They refuse to give you a drink cup after you have paid and make you wait until your food is ready This is especially inconvenient because of the terrible drink station layout with no where to put your food Also don't bother asking for a free cup of water They give you a cup which is smaller than what you get in a kids meal Avoid this McDonald's at every opportunity.
Convenient when shopping in Desert Ridge Marketplace however the pizza was just AWFUL There was too much of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza (who uses cornmeal on the pizza anyway) and the slice was cold when they took it out of the ovenI would not go back for this pizza.
Normally I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub Well having said this the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago First shame on us for resorting to eating here but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had I just remember that it wasn't that great I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of The real reason that I am writing however is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food) My boy and I were cuddling in a booth his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says "How's the dessert let's keep it a family restaurant" Before we could even respond he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes We couldn't figure out what we had done and the more we thought about it the madder we got It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again  Keep it a family restaurant my ass there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale.
I HATE JACK IN THE CRACKthe only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible The past 3 times Drinks get mixed upfries are missingtomatos are there when they shouldn'tfoods coldforget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad but jack in the box sure was able to do it.
Went to the OfficeMax on Stapley asked where an item would be located in the store clerk said they did not have what I was looking for so I continued to shop found the item I asked about a little annoyed however went on my way no biggie Tonight I went into return an item  Cashier had to wait for Manager took 20 minutes then I went & found the manager and asked her to help  Manager was very rude  just continuing to say have a nice night  Very disrespectful  If she would have said I am sorry let me help you right now Instead I left there frustrated  & disrespected  After waiting 30 minutes for 2 copies and 20 minutes for a manager 50 minutes of my night was given to the elite OfficeMax that doesn't need my business   I will never step foot in this Officemax again and would encourage others not to as well.
I am boycotting this Old Navy and Old Navy in general after a recent visit to this store I was shocked at their customer service or lack-there-of.
My husband would give My Big Fat Greek 0 stars but I'm going to give it 2 We actually used to go to the location in Scottsdale and we've also been to this location many times We always enjoyed our meals thereWe didn't have it tonight but I especially like the Bruschetta It's a huge portion I like the grilled foccacia and all that tops it including tomatoes basil hummus and sweet balsamic reduction It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk This is the highlightOn this trip I got a large Greek Salad I like the creamy type greek dressing it's atypical for Greek salad but I'm into it I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl I get a little side of jalepeno cilantro hummus and dip away My husband got chicken and lamb souvlaki tonight The wooden skewer broke into his lamb so he had to do surgery to remove it The lamb had gristle the chicken was under seasoned The side vegetables were undercooked and cold and the rice was tepid When the manager came by asking how everything was my husband gave him the FYI- and he was kind and ordered us a dessert We declined My husband was turned off by the chipped plate of his appetizer salad a cricket crawling along the ground (in all fairness the door to the patio was open) and the light above our table flickering on and off We had a savvy dining coupon for buy one entree get one free and our bill still came to $30 We had to order two drinks to get the coupon My husband got a Sprite and I asked for a hot decaf tea They said they had chamomile but then came back to tell me that they're out of all decaf teas so I got an apple juice I didn't drinkThe $30 meal included:Lamb and Chicken Souvlaki meal with side Greek SaladLarge Greek Salad with ramekin of hummusSpriteApple JuiceWe thought it was pricey for a buy one get one deal The drinks were $3 a piece so really we just got $3 off of my salad because if it weren't for the coupon we wouldn't have ordered drinksOur waitress was very niceEdited: I had to drop it to one star My husband had serious stomach issues the whole night.
Came here for dinner with my wife  Entered and there were about 10 college males inside having drinks  We ordered a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich  Also ordered one piece of bruschetta  The sandwich was not good  The lettuce was old and wilted the bacon seemed like it had been sitting way too long because it smelled funny and was not fresh  We were told we could not choose between the chips and salad because they were out of chips  We were told they get their fresh deliveries on Friday  It was Thursday so that explained why everything tasted old and nasty  The bruschetta tasted like jam and breadI would not recommend to place for food  It is very close to ASU so it might be geared toward young college students who do not appreciate good food and just go for the drinks.
When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had well that exemplifies what kind of experience this wasWe went on Cinco de Mayo and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to I thought that at 5pm we could slip in grab a table in the bar grab food and beverage and get on our wayTo be quick and to the point the service was good but the food was absolutely garbage Bland flat uninspired Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop) the 20 year old manager and the horrific food I'll go out of my way to not go here again.
City Noth=Westgate=Kierland Commons=Tempe Marketplace=Boring Depressing Place Unworthy of Affection.
This restaurant has been shut down before I could eat their delicious food Alerting Yelp management.
Wow I never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary I am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel but holy smokes was this place nasty The shower was clogged the bathroom had hair all over it by the bunches the kitchen was not cleaned the bed had stains all over it The television didn't get every channel and the homeless people didn't help I'm just stunned at such filth Please do follow my advice and avoid this dump It was straight out of a movie.
No service that's none by female bartender on Sunday  I left and will never return  Pass the word.
We stopped in before the movies across the street for a sake bomb and some sushi My side of the table was sticky eeewww And the sushi was very underwhelming the quality was not great especially for the price Even the miso soup was weird and frothy At least we didn't get food poisoning We will not return.
Warning Danger DO NOT ENTER Gross This place is nasty If I could give it less than a star yea I would have While out running errands over the weekend I decided to be adventurous & try a new place I had never tried So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right WRONG The choices were not many and the food was not good The rice tasted like dirt I had some mushrooms that were good Everything was labeled wrong They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms This place is gross We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left We told them your buffet is garbage and we left BTW we did not pay for it either.
Rude rude rude employees I saw a lane open and the cashier was standing at the beginning of the isle when I pushed my cart that way she turned her back to me blocking me from entering I said excuse me is this lane open She turned and looked at me like I was interfering with her day dream Then said yes She went behind the register and I started to unload stuff She asked if I had coupons I said yes and continued to unload When I saw she wasn't ringing anything up just standing there I stopped and faced her she said I have to have the coupon before I can start I have never heard of that before but gave her the coupon She then started to ring up things very slow looking over everything like she was shopping I just waited patiently She never once smiled or offered a hello have a nice day nothing Even when I said hello she said nothing at the end I said have a nice day but still nothing from her but blank stare I will never go back to this Walmart.
Went there recently  have not been to one in AZ  Was mildly surprised by it not being very good  We frequented Applebees a lot in CO because it was close to work  I ordered a chinese chicken salad and it was about a saucer full for nearly 10 dollars My husband had soup and sandwich All you can eat soup came in cup size bowl and sandwich was 1/2  for 8 dollars   Where is the value in that  The waitress was very SLOW to arrive but after that was attentive and very friendly  We both walked out still hungry after an over $2000 check   Wont be going back to Applebees  Would have had a much better lunch at Cheesecake Factory for about the same price.
Maybe it will get better but this was pretty terrible beer  Had the Industrial Pale Ale which just tasted weird  Had a few sips and left it - not worth the calories  The oatmeal stout is okay tasting but pretty watery and weak - tastes like something from Salt Lake City where you can't have a beer higher than 3% or something  The place looks cool and the bathroom is nice and the folks serving are pretty nice  But I'll head over to Taste of Tops Four Peaks or Papago if I'm in the area.
This is the Cinnabon inside the Phoeniz airport It is not a real Cinnabon The coffee was not Cinnabon coffee It was shared with the Burger King next door YuckThe roll was not fresh Threw it away half-eaten.
Boo Not a fan of the food at all Customer service was good & prices were ok.
Closed    Much of the center is vacant except for Ranch 99 and a couple of small shops    Very sad.
Don't understand why this Walmart higher prices I buy the same stuff at the other Walmart and this is a neighborhood Walmart and the prices are like two times higher what's up with that.
Doesn't seem very clean staff is rude waited 30 mins for a burrito thatwasn't what I ordered Food was ok.
My husband and I went to Wingstop for our first time tonight and boy do we regret it The wings and fries were horrible and the sauce left a nasty taste on our mouths We had higher hopes for this place and we are not going back again.
First I hope management notices that this is a repeat review urging them to get rid of the gorilla I was excited to see a brewery open up over here but I was let down with the food and the Nimbus beer We've tried pretzels fried jalepenos sliders and the spinach artichoke dip (no flavor except for the chives and would never recommend or order again) I've tried all of the different beers and favorite so far is the red with a taste of honey but all the other beers are just okay We asked our server if they have a Nimbus IPA he said yes but then returned to let us know he was confused and suggested some other local beersIt's kind of a weird vibe because it seems like brewery but there is a mascot gorilla running around to be awkward with patrons and they have cartoons on TV during happy hour I'm not sure which demographic this place is supposed to appeal to Server was nice attentive and kept glasses full and I do really dig the patio so I'll round this rating up to 3 stars They're brand new and they have good happy hour so I'll be back to give them and their other menu items another try as long as I don't see the gorilla in the front.
Very disappointing bland food burnt pizza crust Only reason we didn't walk out was the lovely food server Vagana Will not go again the end of a family tradition Time to pick a new italian restaurant for next year.
Don't want to even give Lon's one star Had dinner at Lon's in early August It was highly recommended by the concierge of the hotel where we stayed This is the worst restaurant meal I have ever had There were twelve in our group and ten of the twelve meals were unacceptable Not only were the entrees horrible the appetizers and desserts were equally bad The food was bland and flavorless For example my entree was served with truffle gnocchi This should be full of flavor The $4900 steak was loaded with fat and cooked wrong One of them was sent back the other only partially eaten Oh and don't be fooled by the tuna on the lava rockflavorless When this was pointed out to the server and a manager they did not know how to handle the situation I as well as the concierge contacted the food and beverage manager Dave He couldn't have been more rude Said he would contact me and never did Also according to the concierge he said he would contact her as wellnever did There are way too many good restaurants in this area to waste your money at Lon's and they don't appreciate your business I would go to The Mission Elements or Pizzaria Bianco over Lon's AVOID  this restaurant at all cost.
I would never step foot in the place again - I would rather sleep in my car  We picked the Pima Inn to stay as we were down for AZ bike week  First of all they should have told us they were right across the street from Spring Training that there was construction going on and traffic was going to be horrible  They made us wait until exactly 3 PM to check in even though our room was readythe free Internet did not work as the signal was so weak you could not log on they promised a MC wash which never materialized they said they parking for MC's which was some yellow tape and traffic cones they took from the street - and placed it in the middle of the street  I had to run of the brat wanna be base ball players who were sitting in the hall in front of my room door  Then I had to listen to the dog bar all night in the sections labeled "NO PETS"I could go on and on and onhorribly managed worst resort hotel experience I have ever had.
Just AWFUL Dirty stained rooms Complete lack of hospitality hoards of wild loud weekend partying jerks gobs of screaming unruly children Way overpriced everything They were completely bad Unless you are a gluttony for punishment NEVER stay here.
We ordered a smoothie waited patiently for 20 min We were the only ones who ordered 3 couples came in ordered after us but got their drinks before we did Naturally after seeing other pple get their drinks before us I asked if they were still making our smoothieThis guy must've been having a bad day Right away he started yelling at us Making excuses his juice machine was broken I needed to calm down etc I said ok 5 min later he asked us what we ordered We told him turns out he gave the drink to the wrong customer Instead of just re making the drink he started yelling saying we weren't paying attention giving him and his employee attitude He just gave us our money back and yelled at us to get out The other customers left too after seeing his response Extremely unprofessional rude and just plain disgusting attitude Was an african american employee claimed he was the ownerLol we just wanted a smoothie he accidentally gave away our drink blamed his machine made us wait 25 min just to kick us out cause he was too embarassed to apologize We were extremely confused Maybe the juice is good idk we never got to try cause the employee made a mistake ans then kicked us out because he was too embarassed to apologize.
The food is always amazing but sadly customer service is totally lacking  We had the misfortune to have Marina M as our cashier today She was very rude and unpleasant  This was my husband first time so it took him a little longer to look at the menu and she gave us dirty looks and kept sighing along with rolling her eyes Is that really needed My husband just returned from deployment and I thought he would really enjoy something special and different but the employee made us feel as if we were wasting her time and that she had better things to do The food may be amazing but the lack in hospitality makes us never want to come back here again .
I've eaten here before but only had the sushi  I went with a friend the other night and wasn't in the mood for sushi so i ordered off the menu  I ordered a chicken udon noodle dish  The wait time was not unreasonable nor the service up to the point that our food arrived  The chicken was not seasoned at all and tasted as though it had been pre-cooked and warmed up  The noodles were slimey and the dish was totally inedible  We flagged the waitress down and when I told her that I didn't like the dish and that the noodles were slimely  She informed me that they were supposed to be  She took the dish away and two minutes later someone that I assume to be the manager came over with the dish in his hand  He asked  me what the problem was and I explained to him that the chicken tasted like it had been precooked and warmed up and the noodles were slimely  He also informed me that the noodles were supposed to be that way  While he offered to get me something else he was not apologetic in the least and had a bit of an attitude  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms off the happy hour menu  They delivered two deep fried balls about the size of my fist  While they didn't taste old and slimely they were not good and they sat in a pool of soy sauce that  just made everything soggy and salty  The waitress did check back on us to see if we needed drinks but did not ask me about the food again and she seemed to carry on somewhat with the manager's attitude  My friends like the sushi and they do go there a lot  My suggestion if you do go here is that you stick with the sushi and stay away from the other menu items  When the bill came they had deducted a portion of the first dish from the check but had still charged me for a portion of it  It was not as if I'd eaten half of it and then sent it back  I barely took half a bite  I'll meet my friends for a beer and sake here but I will never eat here again.
I should have read Alexander's Yelp review before I ventured out of my La Quinta hotel during my business trip  But we went here for a quick dinner and although their fried ice cream was pretty above average it couldn't equal out for their horrendous spinach enchiladas  Everything was mushy tasting and their white sauce topping on the enchiladas looked like that kind of cheesy topping that is microwaved from 3 days ago  Hal-O-Peno's is a nice pun but doesn't qualify as being a good quality Mexican establishment  Keep walking down the street to find better food  This is the second Yelp "warning".
Is this a joke I literally eat the single worst shrimp scampi dish I have ever had in my life I then asked for a pasta dish with chicken The sauce was terrible and the chicken was very rough In addition the pasta was still a bit undercooked Awful.
I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night Though it seemed quite busy I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival Outside seating despite a hot Arizona summer was pretty nice with shade However this is where the pleasanties endOur table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes No one bothered to offer us drinks and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers When our waiter came he did not even apologize for the wait and we gave our orders: drinks appetizers and pita sandwichesThe hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly only twenty minutes later Both were alright but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita We asked our waiter for extra pita and he kindly agreed The entire duration of dinner it never cameRefills were also a pain as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter and he wouldn't come until ten minutes laterAn hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour Half the tables outside already left including tables that arrived after us and we were the last ones served The food was of average quality and I've been to better with cheaper pricesSlightly expensive I can see as justified But many agree that time is worth much more than money I had an excessive amount over an hour and a half wasted on a decellerating Sunday night Staff is kind of nice but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.
Our visit was unremarkable for my son's stitches 6 days later after making an appt with our PCP to have the stitches removed it occurred to me that WVUC may remove them for free (I work in an ER and some of the Dr's will do this) I called and they said yes of COURSE they would remove them free of cost Sweet I cancelled the appt with his pediatrician and had them removed at WVUC We then later received a bill for $75 for the visit They of course deny that ANY of their staff would ever say the suture removal would be free of charge The office manager was very unhelpful I get so sick of this dishonesty in business stick to what you say Simple And it sounds like I'm not the only one There is an urgent care on every corner in Surprise - use your money elsewhere.
So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews Yes Iam a hater Granted The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club at least to me but what would I know I likes the dive bars So here's the story I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places How this happens I don't know I guess Iam just that awesome Been dragged here twice Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit The other 2 times I went there were not planned but same basic experience each time The sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru duh its freakin' sand It took a while for the bartender to make the drinks since she was the only one in the outside area As for inside lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras AKA super classy I suppose I chose a bad night since whenever a UFC fight is on its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV so my fault there In the end I was bored out of my mind but highly entertained with the group who was doing the "Lean Like A Cholo" dance while sitting in a booth So 1 star and that's being generous.
Traveling all the way from Chandler to this place to find out for myself the greatness as advertised AND we walk in at 4:25 and begin to look and are informed "We are closed now Thank you We will give you a catalog and we will ship to you"  As we explained we just traveled 30 miles to get here AND one of us traveled from California we were given "We are closed at 4:30  Thank you"Really  We couldn't take five minutes to get to shears which is what we went for  Nope  This place didn't want our business  They were closed  (five minutes early)I won't go back  Lots of places sell pet supplies and I don't need to go here again.
I'm usually a fan of the prices and the food variety but when I was walking down the aisle today a mouse ran next to me and hid under some shelves Yes a mouse I tried to take a picture of it but it was too quick Now this place kinda grosses me out.
NOT WORTH IT and disorganized.
Won't be going backThe food was so so  The Front of the House was a disasterWe arrived early  With no real bar area we were taken out back to the fire pit area and told a server would be a long to get us drinks  After waiting 15 minutes I went in and ordered myselfWe were eventually seated 30 minutes after our reservation  They were then out of the entree I had chosenThe courses came very slowly  We had to send back my wife's entree as it was undercookedThe only highlight was the pasta dishThere are many better choices out there.
Terrible terrible service Will not go back It wasn't even crowded for Saturday Brunch We waited and waited for eggs and after 45 minutes left The server checked back with us once to left us know our food was on the way but it never came Hugely disappointed Will not recommend to friends and won't take my out of town guests there either.
Food products are ok but I think some of the staff is pretty unprofessional  They INSIST on making small talk during checkout  Guess what not everyone is interested in making small talk with Trader Joe's staff  But they just can't seem to function unless you respond to their blither  One of the cashier staff made an inappropriate comment to me today perhaps he was upset I wasn't interested in pretending all the Trader Joe staff are my buddies  Geez get a brain this is just a GROCERY storeI am making a complaint to their corporate offices.
Gross I got a combo platter of chicken curry On the menu it had a red pepper next to it meaning to signify that it was spicy but the curry was extremely bland and it looked like greasy water I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper Not only was the sauce a disappointment but the chicken was extremely fatty The fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes First of all their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice The egg roll was okay although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offeringsFirst bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise anyway at least the staff was pleasant) Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making I don't know and won't be back to find out.
While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt  I was led astray  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.
Have always heard Sprinkles has great cupcakes so I stopped in today with my daughter We ordered Lemon and Cinnamon We each took a bite of our own and then a bite of each others and went straight to the trash can The worst cupcakes we have ever eaten Very old crusty and very thick cake I truly do not know how this company stays in business Betty Crocker boxed cupcakes are amazing compared to these.
I went to the resort with some expectations Sadly other than being new it could offer little incentive to ever make a return trip The casino itself seems small and cramped Try to navigate between rows of slot machines and you'll find yourself squeezing between other patrons The management has decided that unless you want to play nickel quarter or dollars you are not welcome I suppose that if you have a small casino and want to maximize your margins you eliminate the small time player who likes to bet pennies Strangest thing of all is the ATM machines that don't dispense coins For coins you have to go to the cashiers window and wait interminably for your 40 cents The dining options are oddly located off the gambling floor and the signage is horrible In an area with other gambling options avail yourself of those options and avoid Talking Stick.
This location is evil with an evil owner named John and a useless manager named Kimberley  I would rather watch wallpaper dry tbs have to deal with this store for anything  This location needs to be shut down.
I've been here a total of 5 times  Ok for lunch will never go back for breakfast  Huge disappointment Bad cold food 30 dollars for 2 people for bfast is crazy not to mention its cafeteria style so you get NO SERVICE for 30 bucksno thanks.
Why oh why is it so hard to find good Chinese food in this town  The two behind the counter at this place are Chinese - please don't tell me you eat the garbage that you serve to the masses in Phoenix as Chinese foodI should have read the previous review because I had a simple beef with vegetables (how could that be screwed up)  Hardly any beef the veggies were all previously frozen  The pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish  The pork is cut into tiny pieces and are extremely fatty - I'm not even sure it's pork  I did see a dead cat not far from the front door maybe he will be on tonight's special menuWahsun is not too far down 19th Ave - GO THERE INSTEAD this place SUCKS.
I cannot state strongly enough how disappointing the management services are at Amcor The particular community manager I have dealt with over the past year is both unfriendly & unprofessional His lack of attention to community concerns will leave your HOA vulnerable to insurance claims or law suits.
Tick tock tick tock The sound of the countdown till the inevitable closure of this pretentious shithole Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to write a review lambasting the evils of a $400 made-in-China t-shirt For a girl as into gross consumerism as I one would think Barney's would represent the ultimate altar at which to worshipThat said I still work hard to earn every damn penny and still expect a certain level of service at this price point I will tell you that the customer service at my ghetto Target is heads and shoulders superior to that of Barney's I have walked in with photos of an item knowing they carry the designer and asked them to find it for me They take my number and email and smile and nod but then crickets I attempt to return a defective handbag (GASP) past the sacred 30-day window in which returns are accepted Much hemming and hawing and excuses and the bag is surrendered mysteriously sans refund with promises of a call from the manager Again crickets I have to stalk the handbag department to see how the Queen Manager has deigned to handle my quandary (for those dying to know they sent the bag back to the manufacturer for repair without telling me) I walk through the shoe department clearly lingering over a certain item and crickets I can see a sullen young man with waxed eyebrows giving me the side eye from the back room but crickets Is it me It's not Foot Locker for fuck's sake I'm not going to wave the shoe at him from across the room and holler out my size Sorry I'm not sure why the staff goes MIA I'm certain that gossiping and doing each other's makeup does not take up a disproportionate chunk of their workday I'm not 18 (read: will not make you bring out every shoe for me to try on for fun) and I'm carrying the same bag you're selling 20 feet away (read: have AMEX/will shop) so I'm not really sure what else I need to do to get some damn helpAdditionally against my better judgement I also sent my poor SO here to have all his suits and grown-up stuff altered when he lost weight and decided he wanted to pretend he was a J Crew model I figured the average tailor was not going to be on the cutting edge (heh) of this season's suit cut but surely of-the-moment Barney's tailor would Sadly the seamstress while perfectly friendly and competent had just as many challenges with English and as little knowledge of trends as the $10-hem-while-you-wait place on the corner The only difference was that the changing room was fancier -- she still needed an excess amount of direction when we came to her hoping she would have the expertise to run the show Sorry Barney's I realize you carry a lot of niche labels and items not otherwise available in retail locations in this state In the golden age of the Interwebs though your benefit of exclusivity is gone Now who wants to place bets on what store will fill their empty space.
Dr Bassett charges to reset crowns that fail in 3 years and doesn't appear to think that is unusual Most dentists I've spoken with since leaving her practice guarantee crowns for at least 5 years If you can afford her emergency fees plus the cost of replacing your crowns ($2000 a tooth) every few years plus deal with her attitude you will be very happy with this dentist.
How can a fellow Yelper rate this as a 5 and me a 1 Maybe it was an off dayThis place is absolutly beautiful The service was average to slow considering I was 1 of 3 tables The chips were bland and the salsa was crap If you took strained canned tomatoes and added an onion powder from the dollar store and a little salt That was the salsa Totally crap I ordered the appitizer combo thinking it would be a good way to sample a little of everything that was the thought it had a mole` type covered enchilada with chicken in it The mole` was decent but it was very sweet no spice at all Maybe this was dessertThe rolled taco things had zero flavor the chimi was alright but anything fried with sour cream on top is The sope or whatever was ok but again had zero flavor the beans had zero flavor the cheese which I think was Cojita was good but not enough on anything I really liked the decor but would have preferred the chicken from the guy cooking out front of the store Totally disappointed I think this is my first 1 star for a business that is still openlol.
Came in and was seated before a party of six we were 3 adults and 2 babies The party of 6 was seated next to us The hostess took our drink order and I told her I was ready to order she said the bartender would be there soon to take our order( where's the real waitress) after waiting 10 minutes we finally got our tea and next to us got there drinks I once again reminded the hostess and bartender we were ready to order now another 10 mins went by and the bartender went to the table next to us and took their order and completely ignored us Horrible we all got up and left.
Besides the drinks i think this place is probably one of the most overrated restaurant in Phoenix And I actually like it's sister restaurant Postino Actually I think the owners are trying to ride the coat ails of its sister restaurants - LGO Postini and Chelsea's Kitchen  The menu has no imagination I was reading the menu and was trying to find something intriguing Perhaps I has high hopes as the owners are shrewd business people I should have just had a drink and went on my way But I gave Radio Milano a chanceRoman artichokes$10  The meatloaf dish we ordered was marginal The vegetable plate was so-so The housemade pasta tasted on par with chef boyardee  After spending $90I left with an empty taste in my mouth  Plus the dished are pretty small Only bright spot was that the service was good and the waitress was attentive But I go to restaurants for quality food not high priced crap.
Nothing wurst than a bad weenie No bun intendend But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog A Chicago hot dog at that In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold But I ain't in the Windy City I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City And I didn't know where to go And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign That was it That's what I needed The universe had answered my calling You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly Yea Well I didn't listent to my gut Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming The place wasn't clean Ok it was dirty Stained floors rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape Hmmmstill not enough for me So I get home with my Chicago style dog with pepperoncini neon relish celery salt tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries Ate it in 90 seconds Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom You get the picture Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.
Lost orders no ice soda machine MIA miscounted change Pure chaos.
Wow reading the other review guess waiting for your food to be served can be an issue at this restaurant  Try waiting an hour and 1/2  Other diners were so perturbed they left in frustration the intrepid restaurant staff then offered the departed diners plates to those still waiting for food - TACKY  By the time our food was served my mother in-laws hot beef was COLD  They supposedly were short 2 cooks Since they had a large group of women and a Red Hat society that seemed to get their food in good timing maybe the cooks walked out mid-shift  My husband wouldn't let me make a stink but after a wait that long with a hot dish being served cold there should have been an offer at comping a meal or taking a certain percentage off  How on earth does this place surviveSalsa was good shredded beef chimi I had was below average and over-fried  At least I know now if ever antiquing in Glendale again I can avoid this restaurantSo far the downtown Glendale restaurants I have tried have been sub-par and not worth trying again (Kimberly Ann's Tea Shop was the other).
E2 was great until a few months ago when I noticed their lattes started tasting like there was no espresso in them  I mentioned this 3 times and it never got fixed so I stopped going  Stopped in recently to see if they'd fixed it and got a latte that was basically steamed milk and vanilla  When I asked about it the girl drew me another "double" shot and it was about 2/3 the size of a single shot  Looks like their machine is not calibrated to measure out shots correctly or (and I hope not) they are purposefully shafting customers on the amount of espresso they put in their drinks  If I'm going to pay $5 for a latte it needs to be made correctly  Get on it guys.
Bad at calling back about schedule changesor waits last minute for needing something I had reschule 2 times with my work because of not letting me know ahead of time.
After visiting the Glendale store two consecutive days and spending nearly $1900 Store Manager Lane Pate left me feeling less than satisfied with my experience Lane had worked with me both days and was informed that I did not have any furniture in the home I was furnishing yet he neglected to mention that with my bed purchase I would not get a frame After the deal was closed and I inquired about frame set up upon delivery he told me the frame was not included and the mattresses would be laid on the floor He then sent me next door to purchase one from Kevin for an additional $54 more dollars I was so shocked I didn't know what to say and just left Even Kevin laughed and then apologized for making fun of the poor serviceI am thoroughly disappointed that during our multiple discussions this detail was not mentioned particularly since this is a necessary component My intentions were to come back and purchase furnishings for the rest of my home but based on how I felt when I left today I will most certainly be doing my shopping elsewhere.
What-a-disaterMy very first experience at a Whataburger and I can not believe the variety of ways they managed to screw it upI was the only person ordering but this place was such a disorganized chaotic mess that ordering a meal took a solid 5 minutes and required two employees and a ManagerI got my meal and immediately realized that they'd gotten my order wrong OK less fries and a larger drink are probably fineBut I got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese isn't melted the jalapenos have no kick and the whole thing is smothered in the cheapest most repulsive American style mustard you've ever eatenI check out the fries and realize there is a 1 to 1 ratio of salt to potato I have to roll them in a napkin just to make them palatableAnd the strawberry shake tastes like a cold chemistry experimentI hate wasting food but I looked at each item and had no interest in any of it so I gave it back to them and asked for a refund The Manger didn't hassle me about the refund and I considered a second star but the food was just too bad to justify it2013 #1 / 365.
This place was shut down by the health department today  Drink there if you can but they ran out of beer this weekend  And I peeked in back to find them pouring $10 vodka into the Grey Goose bottles  Kins of a blatant violation of anything ethical but what do you expect from a hangoverHopefully the cool crew like Doug Snyder Alicia and Linda do better in Old TownVisit if you dare but I visited years ago and it was much better  Word is out that they did not pay anyone who works there and they are selling the placeShame cool spot hopefully someone buys it and brings it back.
Atrocious Consider the price point Dollar for dollar dining out just can't get any worse than this Grease laden obscenely over salted franchise food for twice the amount of money of your standard franchise restaurant  The service Poorly trained staff that has no idea what to do if a customer can't stomach the glop that just came out of the kitchen Why are bread plates on the table if you don't serve bread with the meal How on earth do you get off charging $750 for a short shot of Jack $625 for fake Guinness and $850 for diluted Citron This place offers nothing to get me back in there again It is awful and expensive Oh and one last suggestion to our server last night If any part of a dinner entree is categorically inedible take the WHOLE plate back to the kitchen and let the cook try to repair it Don't break up the dish onto those little unusable bread plates and don't return with the same crap that you left with.
Service is SLOOOOOOW at best Took ten (10) minutes to get a drink refill and our waitress only had three tables She also was uninterested in the customers and had zero personality (not a requirement for the job but hey at least let the customer THINK you are having a semi-decent day) I guess all the cars in the parking lot were from diners at Indulge Burger or Jersy Mikes The chain has tried to up their food choices and quality in part by offering sizzling skillets I ordered one and there was not one sizzle to be heard besides the sizzle in my mouth from the INSANELY spicy sausage I couldn't eat it and might I add nowhere on the menu did it mention it was even slightly spicy I could have breathed fireI guess there's a reason why you're half empty on a Sunday morning - will never go there again Ugh.
My wife went there to get the car waxed Came home with the dried wax all over the car Don't waste your time or money.
We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner  The room was not ready the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians) the A/V equipment didn't work   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broththe owner came back with some excuse for this but the issue was not corrected  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return.
The food is very mediocre  The step down out the front door needs to be addressed  My wife was carrying my 2 year old daughter  and they both fell and landed pretty badly  The floor drops down about 6 inches right outside the door  Needless to say my daughter hit her head on the concrete and sustained quite a bump  The manager got us some ice and a towel but I would have liked a little more assistance and verification that we were going to be okIt's troubling that our society is so sue happy that it's the first thing the restaurant thinks of and tries to distance themselves from the situation and fails to respond in a decent mannerFix your front door  You have it painted so you realize it's an issue  A few bags of concrete and some labor and your entry can actually be safeIf you are in the area Greasewood Flats is a much better choice.
That's what it'll be I said to myself as I drove the 20 miles down to the Doctors office from NW Phoenix Papa Joe's Fish and 'Cue  I had read the Yelp reviews and had wanted to go for weeks now  So on the way back from sitting for 30 minutes in an MRI tube I stopped at what I was sure was going to be a grand slam  Kind of a rough part of Bethany Home Road but I figured it should be ok and it was don't let it scare you off  Walked in and the place was full of people but no one had any food in front of them and since it was nearly 1 PM I figured everyone is already done with lunch (wrong)  Ordered the brisket sandwich and two sides for around $650 reasonable enough and even comes with a drink  I was order #17  I waited for my to-go order by the side counter  After about 10 minutes they called #10 and that was my first red flag  I thought this could be awhile  Sure enough a few minutes later they called #11 then #13  Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control  One of the patrons walked up to the counter and asked for his money back that he couldn't wait anymore  I asked how long he had been waiting and he said an hour and a half  At 35 minutes and really late for work I asked for my money back and they said it was coming right out  Oops turns out #14 was coming out not #17  At that point I just walked out with the nice lady behind the counter telling me she would give me my money back  I just kept walking and will dispute the charge later with AmEx  They seemed like really nice people the place was clean and (supposedly) the food is good   The questions you have to ask yourself is "Do I feel lucky" and "Do I have the disposable time to wait up to 90 minutes for BBQ" -especially when Bobby-Q's is a mile up the road and I can get my meal in under 5 minutes  Very disappointing.
I use to be a member for years though canceled my membership about 2 years ago About a month ago I went in to get a new membership using my employers discount The man that I was working with was difficult He wanted to charge me more then what was discounted through my work I even had the print out from work that I was to have brought in to prove I would get a membership at that rate I was so frustrated The man picked up on my frustration and started to down talk me saying I didn't print the right print out I ended up walking out when he was talking because at that point he wouldn't shut up and listen When I was about to the door he started making fun of the situation with the guy sitting next to him Never again will I be a member I now go to 24 hr fitness on 43rd ave and bell.
For a restaurant that touts to have the largest wine list in Phoenix and carries Fernet Branca to boot I am alarmed to learn that they no longer stock Drambuie The consequence No ordering a Rusty Nail to go with those awesome mushrooms Much less any other drink that requires this apparently elusive liqueurAlso off the list:Bonny PrinceCumulusKiltlifterLoch LomondWarm Wooly SheepBon appetit and but no bottoms up.
Greasy  Wet  soagy  They were out of chicken so i got a mixed of what ever they had left.
They should write a book about how to ruin a soft taco  I didn't think it was possible  The corn tortilla was raw not sauteed or warmed up at all and thus tasted like cardboard  The whole thing was cold  The only good thing was the rice which was very tasty  A woman at the table next to us warned us that her chicken taco was horrible  So why didn't we listen  We figured it was just the chicken but we should have asked more.
funny how one bad experience leads the way for all the others to fall into placethe staffing here is terrible  two people on register one making drinksand the ones at the register are clueless  i gave the girl 5 dollars to add on to my starbucks card and we purchased two drinks  she essentially pocketed 5 dollars because of her incompetence  I had 6 something pre existing on my gold card and my total came out to 9 dollars  somehow she ended up charging me twice and because the website does not reflect pre existing balance after your transaction is complete I can't go back and try and get my money back  and when I mentioned something she said no  you owe moreNEVER AGAIN TRAIN YOUR CASHIERS.
Terrible service  Small portions  Food was overcooked  Would not return  Rating should be "zero stars".
I've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had The service is essentially non-existent and the food comes out cold/lukewarm and of low quality However spicy you make your food it's still somehow obvious that it's just not goodI recommend driving down the street to Tandoori Times instead The food service and experience is infinitely better.
I am forced to give this "company" one star but if I could I would do ZERO The person we have dealt with for nearly a year (Genette Edwards) has been lying to us since before we moved inMy husband and I chose a nice house in a gated Gilbert community to lease until we were sure we wanted to buy here now we wish we hadn't We are paying an exorbitant amount of rent for supposed all inclusive (its in our lease) landscaping and pool service (read my review for Poolman) They picked the crappiest companies they could find for this We are paying roughly $300 a month over market value for this rental and they are pocketing over $200 of that Poolman is worthless and the no name non-english speaking landscapers only show up once a month to raze the lawn to the roots or farther We have the worst looking yard in this neighborhoodThis woman told us she had had the locks changed before we moved in While my husband was out of town a few weeks ago and I was here alone someone broke into this house USING A KEY I had a locksmith who's been in the business for over 20 years come out and he told me the locks on this place (which has been a rental for years) have NEVER been changed They were the contractors master locks from when the house was BUILT in 2001 She then had the nerve to tell me the LOCKSMITH was lying to meAt this point they have violated our lease no less than 12 times in the last 9 months On the up side we never have to deal with them again once we moveHORRIBLE COMPANY DON'T RENT FROM THEM.
Disgusting  All of the print ads this "resort" has is totally misleading and false advertising We went on 4th of July weekend The place was packed and gross The grounds weren't kept up Our room had roaches The pool area was ICK The place is extremely dated Needs rehabThe food at their on site restaurants is sub standard at best Frozen food thats cooked Tasteless Service was blah at best The Hilton name would be ashamed if they knew how this dump was being run Shame on management.
After reading the great Yelp reviews on this place I was excited to go check it out and get supplies for a collage project I have in mind  I was immediately impressed with the variety and volume of paper and I really liked that they have grouped it by color family It's almost overwhelming all the beautiful paper they have there So why the one star Well I don't look like a hobo but for some reason I was never greeted or offered help once they finished with customers there before us Yet several older women who looked like  um seasoned shoppers came in after I did and were cheerfully greeted and assisted Honestly this wouldn't have been a big deal but the paper is arranged in layers on rods and I couldn't figure out how to remove it without messing up the other paper Eventually I got tired of being ignored and lefton the way out the man working there glanced my way and didn't say anything at all I was sad because I had no paper and felt unwelcome in their shop.
I haven't yet tried Takamatsu Korean food so this review is strictly for their sushi The honest truth is this place has the WORST sushi I have ever had in my life It was a disappointment to say the least even for an all you can eat place (which aren't very good most of the time) The sushi had way too much rice three times the normal The fish was not fresh and the mix of flavors were weird One roll I tried was the volcano roll which was four pieces of thinly sliced riced with a small center of cream cheese sitting in a pile of pungent garlic oil and had an off sour taste to it We tried four rolls and most did not contain all the ingredients mentioned in the description so I don't know if they ran out of ingredients or what The reason for only trying four rolls is because those were the first round and after trying them we were so disgusted we couldn't order more We also tried the shrimp tempura and I think they used the wrong sort of batter because it had a soft and chewy texture to it The gyoza dumplings were very greasy and had minimum filling Overall I wouldn't recommend the sushi here to my worst enemy This is a Korean restaurant and they should stick to what they do best.
how this company has such great reviews is beyond me i called and got two specific quotes for service and made an appointment for a specific time for the work to be done so that it could be done as quickly as possible 5 hours after i dropped my vehicle off for my "scheduled" appointment it still hadn't been looked at but the real issue is that the services that i got very clear quotes on were now more expensive one by only $15 but the other by more than $100 i'm losing faith in yelp.
I saw Beaver Choice profiled a long time ago on Eden Eats and always wanted to try it  I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place and was so excited  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work  Heck I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open  And got a very nice email back too  So last Saturday me my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away  The waiter was pretty good too  Good startWe got the fries with cheese and gravy to start  It was ok but most importantly fresh and hot  Then our dinner came and it was a different story  I got the stuffed chicken mashed potatoes salad and cole slaw  My daughter got a hamburger medium and salad  And my friend got meatballs mashed potatoes and cole slaw  The mashed potatoes were cold  My daughter's hamburger was well done and the bun was ice cold  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well  Not horrible but definitely room for improvementSo we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat  But you know what the clencher was  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold  She didn't say a word and walked away never to return  Didn't offer to reheat the food maybe throw in a dessert nothing  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door prior customers I think   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers  After all wasn't that why she moved to expand her businessGuess what  I live close and also work at a very close and large office building  We go out to lunch a lot  You better believe I won't be back and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either   There's never an excuse for poor customer service especially by the "OWNER" of the restaurant  A waiter usually nothing to lose  The owner has everything to lose  I hope she reads this.
Went in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner The place wasn't busy at all we sat at the bar After being handed menus 3 waiters including the bartender never took our order After sitting for over 10 minutes without one person taking our drink order a couple walked in and the bartender immediately made conversation and got their drinks They must be regulars because he knew what they wanted to drink We got up afterwards and left as waiters were gathered talking amongst themselves and didnt seem to care that customers were leaving We drove across the parking lot to Islands Burgers and was seated served and had our order put in within 8 minutes.
Ok so my reference point is Little Tokyo in LA  I ordered an ahi salad and a Soporo  Trying to do the healthy thing  The salad simply didn't have flavor and was over priced at $15 and my beer was $10  But I can live with thismaybe it costs more to transport to the AZ  Like whatever im a grown upWhat killed me though was the service  My salad was forgottenbut ok it happensbut it still arrived before my beer Which I had to ask about      Sothe waitress finally checks on me then I ask her for the checkto get things going I just hand her my credit card  And sigh you can guess the rest  After 15 min  i have to walk up to the register to settle RrrrrrrrrrrrPositives is that this place is a magnet for cute girls which at least can take your mind to a happy place while waiting in purgatory Also the manager followed up quicklySo next conference I will stick with the hotel restaurants which have been good thus far and fair prices.
Honestly every single time I shop at this location I leave feeling belittled and bewildered I'm not a professional MUA but I make sure to do extensive research before purchasing any cosmetic item On several occasions I've gone into this Sephora with the intent of purchasing $50-$150 dollars worth of merchandise You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now yet I continue to throw myself into the gauntlet of useless employees that wander aimlessly and reek of arrogance I HATE this Sephora By far the worst one I've EVER been to It's a shame I live on the west side of town because the Scottsdale location is far superiorTime and time again I leave this location feeling as though I've been looked down upon and written off Or better yet I get "information" about products I'm not the least bit interested inUnfortunately I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the futureOh and I believe the woman who "assisted" me last week was named Megan Here's a tip for you: Change your foundation I'm surely not buying a product if you're wearing it and I can see every pore wrinkle and hair on your face.
Atmosphere was funky  We went last week with two gift certificates from Sunflower Markets  When our server finally came with extra sighs and huffs of over-work blithering Before greating us looked at the gift certificates sitting on the table and said 'you can't use those both here'--it's the rules of the owners  So I asked are we allowed to split checks at a table--'no'  We can't really comment on the foodthe staffer was so rude about it that we actually walked out(We have tried the location at PV Mallwe had a great experience with the atmosphere and serverfood was okay: salad-good GF pizza-below average).
We had been regular customers of Mary Coyle going back a very long time I used to go there with my family when I was a child (at the previous location on Thomas & 15th) I went to high school with one of the Coyles My wife and I (and now my son) used to celebrate special occasions there or just sometimes for fun It was our favorite place to visit after the Fiesta Bowl Parade every yearNO MORE NEVER AGAINWe visited this evening (Saturday night November 27 2010) The place was busy so a delay could be understandable But waiting over 20 minutes with no water no service and absolutely no acknowledgment was not good - and that's just the beginningAfter finally having to flag a waitress down we waited another half hour for our ice cream However my wife's was not as requested and was missing most of one flavor (which wasn't discovered until near the bottom) Also we were rather hungry having just come from the Encanto Park 75th Anniversary celebrationWhen we commented on the problems the waitress firmly stated that since the ice cream was finished everything must have been satisfactory - and anyway it wasn't her fault as she didn't seat us she didn't make the ice cream etc When we continued (politely) with an inexperienced person who identified herself as the supervisor on duty that person stated in an argumentative tone that store policy was that any adjustment to the check after finishing was considered theft since in their eyes they had served the customer and we had eaten what was served The staff then continued that any request by us to ask for an adjustment (even a minor one which was all we sought) was attempted theft on our part regardless of service timing or other factorIn many years I have almost never encountered such miserable inappropriate and immature customer service as we did this evening If you want to spend your money take it to a place that deserves your patronage - which ISN'T Mary Coyle.
Just terrible I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill nope I got pan fried flavorless garbage The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else Bad food bad service way to loud why is there no negative star rating This place gets negative two stars If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining.
ok so I read the bad reviews on here but I still wanted to give this place a try since it's a new place for revloving sushi Also I wanted to compare and see if it was better than Teharu Sushi in Tempe Well I was not impressed at allThey really need more variety of sushi rolls The whole time I was there I was just waiting and hoping to see if different rolls would be coming my way but NOPE it was the same california roll salmon roll or vegas roll just rotating in circles I don't want to be eating the same rolls over and over So because of thismy friends and I ordered sushi off the menu Each roll it took them more than 30-40 mins to make And this place wasn't even packed There were total of 3 sushi chefs in the kitchen making sushi tooughI think I was at the restaurant for a good 2 and half hoursThe sushi itself was nothing special I only liked one of their roll and I only saw that type of roll rotate around onceHonestly I would not go back here ever againIf you want the whole "revolving sushi" experience go to Teharu Sushi just sayin.
We visited the Valley Ho this past weekend for a bachelor party planning to take advantage of the "hip" pool scene and enjoy a nice weekend among friends  When our group arrived we loaded our luggage as well as a hefty amount of adult beverages onto a luggage cart and made our way to the rooms  I'd like to point out that there were 14 bigger guys on this trip and we were planning to stay for 3 days  We did not try to cram into rooms and had reserved 4 standard 2 double bed rooms along with a large suite  No later than 15 minutes after checking in there was a knock at the door by the 5'6" head of security Mike that has an obvious small mans complex  When we asked if we had already been too loud and received a noise complaint he responded politely with a "No we just noticed you gentlemen brought a large amount of alcohol with you and we wanted to remind you of our no party policy"  While we did have a large amount of booze on board it was for 14 people for 3 days  Good start to the trip and great first impressionWe brushed Mike off had a couple of cocktails and headed down to the pool  It was a Friday afternoon so there were a fair amount of people but not overly crowded  They have daily drink specials including buckets of beer so for a "trendy" hotel drinks were definitely reasonable  There were several groups of people tossing a nerf football across the pool to each other and the crowd was having a good time with it  That is until Mike decided to show up cell phone and maglite attached to his belt at the hip  He made a nice "hey I'm open" gesture with his arms making everyone think he wanted to join in the fun  Maybe he wasn't on such a power trip after all and we had misread him  Unfortunately we were wrong and when someone tossed him the ball he promptly took it away like an 8th grade bully  He didn't seem to mind all of the boos from the crowd as I am sure he is used to them by now  We made the best of the rest of the afternoon and went on to enjoy our evening out in ScottsdaleThe Saturday pool party we had heard about was what we were really looking forward to since we had heard it was one of the new hot spots in town  When we arrived at the pool we see a security line set up like it was a Vegas night club  Looked promising until we see our friend Mike working the door  None of us realized prior to the trip that only hotel guests were allowed in  This is the first time I have heard of this and one of the reasons The W down the street is a much better optionWe had reserved a cabana and the service staff all day was awesome  This review is in no way a reflection on them but simply management and security  When we had finally settled into the cabana area we notice that there is coincidentally a security guard posted just outside of it on the corner  Sweet  Thanks MikeI am not going to try and pretend that the group of guys we were with was this quiet bunch of friends looking for a relaxing day at the pool  We had come for the "Hottest Day Party In Scottsdale" we had read about and they also try to advertise  Several of the friends in the group get extremely rowdy but in a fun way that always gets the crowd going and laughing as well  After the first hour the crowd had been won over and everyone was having a good timeOur cabana had come with a bunch of pool toys including a blow up beach ball  That ended up in the pool for about 2 minutes until good old Mike could scamper over take it away from some other patrons and remove it from the party  Why the hell did you give it to us in the first place then  Once again the boos from the crowd didn't seem to phase him  On at least 5 occasions there were moments with other groups that also drew the same types of reactionsWe made the best of the day despite the fact that the DJ sucked and all started to head back up to the room  Our next wonderful experience occurred when we were making the 30 foot walk from the poolside door of the lobby to the elevators  Halfway through we hear a screeching voice screaming at 2 people in our group to put their shirts on  At this point of the day we definitely responded with some smart ass comment as we had had enough  I told the woman manager that this was the worst hotel experience I had ever had and her response was "then why don't you stay somewhere else next time"  No problem thereThe only positives are that the rooms were nice the staff at the pool other than security was awesome  The rooms with two beds have full beds so if you plan on having 2 people in 1 it is not going to be comfortableOther than the room and the staff Mike sucked management sucked pool party and DJ sucked  Luckily the group we went out there with can make anywhere we are at a good time or we would have been even more disappointedHave fun.
Okay the Hot and Ready deal is a joke  They never have the $5 pizzas ready and there is always a wait  To top it off the last three times I have been there the clueless counter person has given away our pizza and bread to someone else making our supposed 10 minute wait closer to 20-25 minutes  While you can't beat the cheap price the service is seriously lacking.
Avoid this location With just one single tux rental I had a plethora of issues Sabrina was the one "helping" me with my tux At the time of measurement I was unable to place my deposit because she shut her computer off making me call back 3 times on the three following days just to give my card number for the deposit she lost my measurements had my pickup scheduled an hour away from my original pickup location and after driving all over Arizona I found that she had given the wrong shoe and pant size at pickup I will never be returning to this location and I am skeptical about the local Men's Warehouse locations due to significant lack of both help and any sense of apologetic behavior.
Just walked in to grab a few bagels There were two people working One guy who knows what he was doing the other lady was prepping a bagel There was one other Patron so it wasn't busy by any means The lady prepping the bagel didn't even acknowledge us as we stood there for 5 mins just on the other side of the counter Good customer service tip Say hi and you will be right with you We got nothing and left We will never be back She didn't even make eye contact.
When fiance and i walked inwe looked at each other in shock at how tiny this place was "No big" i said "this could be one of those amazing spotsi mean people look like they are enjoying their meals" i was way off Very disappointing Table was dirty Server let us sit for almost 10 minutes before giving us a menu Then took my order and walked away without my fiance's order Weird I ordered soup and it wasn't good It was bad Lunch meals were decent Bathroom is gross which indicates to me their kitchen may not be any different I wish I had visited the bathroom BEFORE I ordered (while waiting for FOREVER) because after seeing the water beetle and who-knows-what-insect in the god-forsaken disgusting hole-of-a-bathroomI would have left FAST IM SERIOUS Look at my other reviews of other restaurantsyou will see that I am always honest.
Disgusting If I wanted reheated food I would have got a TV dinner for cheaper My beans were burnt around the edges and you couldn't pick up the bowl it was so hot Also our "waiter" waited on us twice to take our order and get payment We waited 15min for him just to bring the check.
The family and I are in town for Spring Training and we were looking for something low key near our Hotel  With such great reviews we pulled up at 7:30 PM on a Sunday and I expected to have to wait for a table  There was ONE other family in there eating  That should have been a sign  We were sat by a really nice young waitress  She took our drink order but was not very knowledge about the wines available  We ordered a house Chianti and a house Cab Sauv  The wine came out and smelled like stinky socks  The "Anti Pasta" was a little bit of mystery lunch meat on top of shredded iceberg  I thought the stench I was smelling was my Wine fermenting while we were there  The was a sewage smell in the air  When I went to the restroom I walked into a wall of sewage smell  It was pretty bad  That was it for me  The pizzas came out but at different times and it was actually decent but I couldn't get the sewage smell out of my nose hairs  Maybe if you went in didn't order wine didn't order an "anti pasta" didn't sit at the table closest to the bathrooms and ordered a plain cheese pizza you would like this place.
We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time but haven't been in a while  Man what a difference- and not in a good wayIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe  There were several less than pleasant surprises  First off they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys  That was a minor issue for us but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch  I ordered a cup of coffee some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler and we looked at the menu  It seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items  I loved the eggs benedict before and ordered it again  My husband ordered the crepes  We anticipated our mealsMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds  Shocked I saw it wasn't just eggs but hashbrowns and fruit  It was also NOT warm  That surprise was a $9 mealWhile waiting for our meal I drank most of my coffee  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup  He took my cup which I though was odd and brought it back with warm steaming coffee  Yay  Upon getting the bill I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup  Lastly our food was delivered  My eggs benedict was not warmagain  What is with cool food  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce and honestly it just wasn't that tasty  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad but not flavorful  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast we were less than pleasedThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best  We will not go back  This was just one disappointment after another.
Don't go here I went for a possible UTI and after I gave a urine sample the NP told me she didn't think it was a UTI and that I should go to another doctor for a possible Infection I went to another doctor and found out it was a UTI After paying for the minute clinic and the doctor with no insurance I am out 200 dollars Waste of money and time Go to a Real Doctor.
i live 4 blocks away from this "ghetto long line safeway" (as seen on facebook check-in)  worst customer "service" ever  usually only has 2 lines open 3 when people start blocking the entire front of the store  i stopped by tonight to buy a few bottles of my favorite alcoholic beverage went to the shortest line (the "express" line) and was told by the rent-a-cop that this line was closing and that i had to wait in the other line that was 8 carts deep  i set my basket down walked out and drove to Fresh & Easy  see ya Ghetto Long Line Safeway.
This was an incredibly overrated restaurant We chose it because of high marks on yelp We started with mushroom soup which was salty brown water with a vague mushroom flavor We sent it back and got a beet salad which was fine To be fair my main course of trout was good The cioppino my son and husband had was the worst we had ever ordered It was supposedly a main course but was quite small The shrimp were tiny with a few pieces of shell fish and a very small piece of fish in a watery red broth without any character My son went next door to order a pizza so that he would have something to eat The bill was $12000 and we felt incredibly ripped off.
I love sushi and the sushi here tasted good but- myself and my boyfriend got sick after eating here  We ordered the "white tuna" sashimi and a handful of rolls and nigiri  After leaving we learned that "white tuna" does not exist it is either albacore or escolar (snake mackerel)  While everything tasted great something did not sit well  Many of our symptoms are in-line with escolar-induced keriorrhea but seem to go beyond that  This experience has made me think twice about going out for sushi again in the future.
Not Impressed  Music way to loud - server was an order taker People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left  Yes it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place  We wont be back.
I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona  First they provide us with John McCain  Then Jan Brewer  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us which we didn't even vote on  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NO PICTURES YOU STUPID TOURIST BITCHOkay maybe she didn't say the "stupid tourist bitch" part but it was in her eyes Her eyes were like evil little pegs stabbing me in the heart I loathe you gelato scooper ladyWhat was I thinking taking pictures of the gelato sign outside I didn't realize I was breaking some secret gelato code: no photos of the gelateria or else ye shall be verbally lashed in front of ten(s) of people WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE PICTURES OF OUR GELATO YOU STOP IT NOWUm okay Why the fuck notYOU WILL TRY TO STEAL OUR RECIPESOh I get it I can deduce a recipe simply by LOOKING at gelato Wow I am a fucking genius YOU CAN HAVE PICTURES FROM OUR WEBSITEOkay now I am pissed off And I haven't had any gelato yet First she cockblocks my photographing skillz Then she tells me I may be a gelato-recipe-stealing thief And now she's "graciously" offering me pictures from their website as a consolation Gee THANKSBy this point I've mentally committed myself to hating their gelato And thankfully their gelato did not change my mind It was mediocre unflavorful and slightly watered down Hey gelato lady I didn't want pictures of your second-rate gelato anyway Take that.
Watch out for thieves The rented rafts get stolen if you look the other way my sons shoes were stolen the pretzels we bought to snack were stolen even my sunscreen  was stolen right in front of my nose Parents are just as trifling as bad kids if you see your child is wearing someone else's shoes why do you allow and encourage that  And how are you going to eat someones food This is just nasty I rather pay more and go to Wet and Wild instead and save myself from little criminals and their parents.
I have went into Bashas 3X in the past week to find out about a promotion for a local event that they sponsor was in their add and they are to have a display in which to enter for free tickets/ and you can purchase () for free tickets NO ONE can tell me what the hell I need to purchase I got one manager was told to come back the next day to talk to the next manager (it was ONLY the 1st day of the ad and they did not have the info yet) Understood today trip 3 (the NEW ad came out yesterday still NO ONE can tell me a thing REALLY Buy Miller beer he tells me ok 6pk 12 pk He does not know Go figure I could have bought the stupid tickets for what I spent driving down there trying to find out what you should have been able to find out on day 2.
Paisley moved locations (by about 100 yards) and on the new location was a mural beloved by the neighborhood and painted by an internationally-renowned Phoenician artist called El Mac who creates amazing and sometimes massive murals all over the worldThey painted over it.
Where to begin I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skillsI'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it inAttempt one: "We don't accept reservations this late" (The coupon required a reservation) Attempt two: "We're not open this late on Sundays" (It was 7pm) Attempt three: "We're not open doing construction on the patio"In each attempt mentioned above a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his replyThe final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered she was much more professional and customer-service oriented (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone Hint Hint)After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired $25 wastedThe owner said he felt bad about it and gave us a few free drinks I was livid However I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting) The salad was disappointing the cheese overpowered it I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plateThe friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoningI think I should be forgiven for the one-star review the rating is well deserved.
This location needs to be educated in regards to gluten intolerant people Like you need to change your gloves and wash your hands when someone says they are allergic to beardAlso the owner and his fiance need to communicate better They are on different shifts If I go in while he is there he is great and has amazing understanding of my issues and what I am asking for is my sandwich (the same portions of a 6") to be placed in a bowl He puts it in a salad bowl Now granted it's not filling up a salad bowl and that is fine But when she is there she denies that I have this arrangement with the owner and will put it in a soup bowl Now you've got to know that the same equal portions of a 6" would not fit in a soup bowl Especial my topping choices Get on the same page and educate your staff.

Over a week for horrible customer serviceCustomer since 2007 not anymoreI basically wrote them off after talking my dad and family into ordering from them one night instead of Papa John'sFresh ingredients and real food rightBut after they delivered it the pizza I ordered for dad was soggy and undercooked (which is alway the worst when you build a place up finally get others to try it and get burned)2 weeks ago for Father's Day I was spending time with my dad and asked him what he wanted to do for dinner he asked for Z'sI tried to persuade elsewhere but he just wanted to relax at homeSo I called up and placed an order then ran to pick it upWhen I left with it they forgot to put the 2 slices of pizza in the bag (I looked in it and thought everything was there)Get home realize they are missing so give them a callme-"Hey this is Steve I was just there you guys forgot my 2 slices of pizza""ya they are sitting right here"me- "okkkkkk well what do you guys do in situations like this""they are sitting right here"me- " Okwell we just sat down to eat and I'm not running back up there right now so in situations like this what do you guys do to make this right have the delivery driver drop them off or just refund me for them""I will add a 5 dollar credit to your account that you can use next time"me- "uhhh I think the 2 pieces cost more than 5 bucks so can you just refund my card back the right amount"At this point I was already DONE with this place who forgets food then doesn't offer to make it right THEN lowballs you on a credit If you are going to offer me a different amount At LEAST offer me MORE than what I paid for not LESSINSANE"ok I just did the refund"me- "thanks man"that's it no apology nothing He also sounded like he wasn't on point and after the way he handled it AND originally forgetting my food I was worried about the refundI kept an eye on my credit card account and 3 business days later still no refund so I called back up to find out whats going onHe never did itWednesday:after 20 mins on the phone I am told that the owner will have to call me back to investigate this and issue a refund Odd that NO ONE there can handle this or refund my moneyFriday:Still no refund and no call from the owner so I call AGAIN and explain it all over for the 2nd time I was told the owner would have to call me and let me knowlater that day he does is nice on the phone says sorry and that he can't refund me back on my credit card that I will have to swing by to pick up the refundonce he is done I explain how disappointed I am and how I waited almost 1 week and had to call 3 times for a refund after not getting my food getting a lowball credit offer and being told I would get a refund and NOT and that I now have to drive back up there to collect my refund He has nothing to add but "sorry" and he is "trying to make things better there because there has been some customer service problems"------Well earlier tonight I was riding by so decided I would grab it (a tank of gas in my bike) so went in and asked for itopen up the envelope thinking mmmmmmaybe they will throw something in there like a free pizza coupon to make it right but nope6 bucks and 1 pennyIf they had thrown a coupon in I was already mentally ready to ask for the manager and give it back I don't want their food or anything FREE and that it's the principle and I thought it would be BOSS to do give it back :Dbut would had scored points in my book for the effortbut NOPEall of that calling them 3 times all just so I can drive back up there to get my money backso heads upthis is how they treat customers who have gone there for years who's orders get forgotten and takes them almost a week just to give a refundas a business owner and former manager in the food industry that isn't how you take care of your customerssuch a shame love supporting local businesses and had recommended them to quite a few people beforeso if you are thinking about hitting this one I HIGHLY recommend you look east 2 buildings over Pino's- http://wwwyelpcom/biz/pinos-pizza-al-centro-phoenix  and try them outAMAZING customer service friendly helpful and waaaaay better foodseriously you can see I gave them a 5 star almost 1 year ago that's where I've been going for pizza since.
Honestly was SO disappointed by this place after all of the rave reviews and my love of phillys I thought it would be awesome I got there and it took me 20 minutes not exaggerating to put in my order because the employee was on and off the phone walking around and just couldn't concentrate for two seconds My friend and I were the only two people in the store and they messed up my order TWICE The first time my macaroni wedges were frozen and the second time they gave me a completely wrong sandwich I'm all for having fun at the work place don't get me wrong but the main employee who also took my order really seemed to be on some kind of drugs and super out of it she couldn't wrap her head around what I wanted or why my order was wrong She also proceeded to do handstands with another employee spotting her behind the counter really classy guys.
hey fate  you were better when you were that hole in the wall on university called lucky dragonboonastiest food ever.
My wife and in-laws decided to try the North Phoenix Bill Johnson's out tonight to celebrate my in-laws anniversary  (My wife and I had never eaten there) We had been enticed to give it a shot after purchasing a deal chicken gift certificate  Fool me once shame on youWe were excited at the happy hour options and enjoyed a couple $1 beersunfortunately this is where the pleasantries stopped  After ordering we spent over 40 minutes looking around the 1/3 full restaurant for our food to arrive  At no point did our server Charlean apologize for the long wait or offer refills to my wife's soda  When the food finally did come it was cold  We would've mentioned it to our server but she didn't come back for 30 minutes to finally bring us our bill and at no point did she ask us if we need anything else or if the food was meeting expectations  I would've mentioned the experience to a manager but after the hour and a half in the restaurant I didn't really feel like asking around to figure out who the manager wasparticularly when we were trying to celebrate an anniversary  I spent year's in the restaurant business and I don't know which is the most disappointing - slow/cold food poor service or the inability to locate a managerregardless if this is the Bill Johnson's standard of service I will not be fooled twiceTaylor.
Just OK I think the pizza is fair but the lack of space inside and the customer service is horrible.
Had an awful experience with Jimmy Woos  I wish I would have written this review a few weeks ago when it happened but it slipped my mind until just now  I group of us from work got take out from here and while I know take out leaves more room for error this was incredible  I got a kids meal because I wanted a little bit of everything and the dessert included  I got the shrimp lo mein that came with beef instead of shrimp they charged me for the fried rice which was supposed to be included and they didn't even give me my dessert which I was so excited about  Luckily I work with nice people so one of them went back to the restaurant for me to tell them how they completely messed up my order and they took off the fried rice charge and gave us a free dessert but just too much had gone wrong to recover me so I probably won't be back  Sorry Jimmy Woos I really did want to like you.
Martie is horrible and mean stay awayReally bad customer service and just flat out mean Especially Martie the owner.
This place is a pit in the sketchy part of town  The first "suite" we checked into had hair on the bed and all over the bathroom floor  They moved us into another room that had a filthy toilet  To fix this the poor lady at the front desk had to come clean it herself  Yesshe was the only person working  The place is outdated run down and obviously the maids are not doing their job  Marriott needs to check in on this place.
This place is tired on every level Staff is polite and friendly but thoroughly inefficient and clueless There's a cute hotel around the corner called Clarendon just go there and enjoy life )Back to the 'Hilton Garden Inn': interiors are dated to say it polite the 'bar tender' is more interested in watching some football games on the TV screen the breakfast room staff on weekends just sits there doing nothing even when you're the only customer (note: the staff during the week is different they're good) Check in is delayed way beyond 3PM I've ordered a taxi to the airport on my check-out day: they did order one but managed not to tell me that it's actually here for 20 minutes And so on Never again - NOT recommended Ah and well they don't reply to emails either.
I went to this place twice to really give them a chance I wanted to like it so very much It's in a really cool old building and it's downtown but easy to drive to but I'm not going back The place looks like a giant disorganized thrift store The food is terrible and super expensive for what it is I got french fries once which were ok but way too greasy and kind of soggy The second time I got a salad which was starting to rot and was drenched with a very thick sweet dressing It was the worst salad I've ever had To top it off on my second and last visit one of the owners made fun of higher quality beer I don't know anyone who would purchase semi expensive food and then order a super crappy beer to go with it This place just doesn't seem well thought out.
Did anyone else see the expose they did on Jiffy Lube on the local California news channel Someone sent me the vid on YouTube I think so if you want to hear about why never to go here check it out The crux of it is they scam a large percentage of their customers Now I'm sure that there was a big crackdown after the viral effect of that news story but I am hard pressed to believe that it doesn't happen at all anymore Changing filters running specialized machines etc are hard to track the concrete effects of and whether they actually did or not Seriously I would only go here and purchase something beyond a simple oil change if I personally knew the employee Otherwise prepare to get way overcharged for work that they said they did but probably didn't It's a crazy mixed up world out there kids.
My Consumers experience and observations: I first went to the Celebrity in 1973 to see Gordon Lightfoot Over the years I have seen many other concerts there and enjoyed myself I have got to say this venue  has changed considerably and it needs major refurbishing Also I have some safety and security concerns We went to a concert there this past week for Pepe Aguilar ---- and have not been there in about five years The sound system is inadequate for the acts they are presenting and the seating is very poorSafety and security issues -  my opinion At about twenty minutes into his performance - we still had the same group of intoxicated young women standing directly in front of us and would not sit down Most everyone else had set down in the area  At first I asked nicely and they started to give us a hard time  I did raise my voice once because it was so loud There was no presence of any staff in the area we were in I walked down and no one was in the entrance area I went back to my seat ---- and the women started yelling - "See We Set Down"  then the situation escalated a bit with them dropping a few F bombs directed at the both of us ---- and I went down stairs again - and had to get all the way to the bar area before I found a staff member - I told him there is no one from staff in our area or proximity -- he said he would get a manager ----- Went through three different people before a manager showed up - and he took me outside - I had told him what was going on ---- and he said I needed to read the back of the ticket ---- and at a venue people can stand and there is nothing they can do about it  ---- he then said my behavior was scarring him ---- and wanted a police officer to talk to me ----- I told him I was not going to leave my wife alone ----- He would not let me back in until I spoke to an officer - He did have someone go to the area to make sure nothing happened to her The officer who showed up did explain they had no control over people standing up He was very polite  I asked to have someone from staff go back with me to my seat ---- so the small group would know ---- I was complaining about them --- The staff member  told me there would be someone in the area (they were there for about ten minutes) and one of the staff members apologized to me and apologized about the lack of numbers on the seats ---- that is another issue --- apparently they are painting and the seats or aisles are not numbered - at least in our area When we first came into the venue ----- I asked someone for assistance and they took me to the seats - then some other patrons tried to kick us out ----- demanding the seats until they finally figured it out they were wrong Another issue about safety ---- there is no aisle lighting - making it very difficult to get out of the areaRegarding the standing up issue ----- another review here mentions that - the theater  would not let people stand ---- and kicked them out I guess it depends on the show I am concerned that there is not enough staff to safely manage a variety of issues including enough people to escort individuals to the correct seats Also I believe the manager - went overboard talking about my behavior - I made no threatening comments or gestures ----- If there was a problem with my behavior - clearly I demonstrated I was trying to resolve a situation by seeking assistance which was difficult to find That was part of my frustration This establishment needs a remodel the facility and make sure there is staff available for guest  assistance  And --- according to management - there apparently they have no control intoxicated individuals that won't sit down and let others enjoy the show  Fortunately the young women finally  left us alone ----- but we left early so there was no chance of them harassing usMy recommendation to management for a more rewarding customer experience:1 Have more staff on duty to deal with customer service issues - or manage staff better to have all areas covered At minimum the venue should have one person covering each seating section at all times to deal with a wide variety of issues This could eliminate many problems2 Be more sensitive to customer complaints Management could have offered relocating customers if there is a problem (if seating is available) We had to sit through the concert worried we would be harassed3 Install basic aisle lighting for increased safety of the guest4 The current seating needs to be replaced with more comfortable seats and or more room between the seats in front of a patron ----- If I had not had an aisle seat - I would have had to crunch my legs up against the seat in front of me -- and we know how that would have gone with that group in front of us :).
ahhhhh why does everyone where this cheap crap Now my daughter wants to wear it This is outsoursing at it's worse It barely makes it through the wash.
I am just going to hit on the new "Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve" since most of the year Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12 Previously Mill was barricaded off you had to pay to enter and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance Now that Tempe has taken over the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks Now while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture in the case of the Fiesta Bowl an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year Honestly I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual) and all the while the only "entertainment" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money  But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you.
Little Caesars Marcos Numero Uno etc the fast food of pizza joints Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated ready to go'  Quite simply you get what you pay for I don't even put Pizza Hut Papa Johns Dominoes in the same category as these places at least their pizzas are cooked to orderLittle Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap and it's incredibly greasy However the price is unbeatable For $5 you can get a large pizza but it's easy to see why.
15 StarsI don't understand why this place has good reviews  I usually trust YELP but this place was horrible  The food was very blan and overcooked  I had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans  There was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste  I would head to Frank and Lupes for some decent Mexican food  I will not be going back to Los Olivos.
Terrible food at lunchtime Flavorless uninspiring and thus overpriced There is such good food in Scottsdale- just go somewhere else.
COCKROACH  Oh Carraba's  I've always like their food and their service but don't have the stomach to ever return to this location  On my recommendation the family came here for my mother's bday dinner in mid-July  (Luckily) before our food arrived something caught my eye on the half wall directly above the infant carrier  In the middle of the restaurant at peak dining time there was a roach  I pulled the carrier away quickly and my fiance killed it with a napkin  Roaches are possibly the most disgusting thing on the planet that I can think of  I may have a roach phobia if that's possible  Anyway we discreetly told the server who to his credit was incredibly alarmed and handled it beautifully  He immediately went to his manager (we watched)  That's when it went wrong  We waited for probably 10-15min for the manager to come over  He followed protocol and told us our entire table tab is free  He also offered to still serve us our food or send it home with us  Uh no thanks  But then he asked for an address giving the reason that the pest control company likes to contact us when this occurs  This made us wonder about the frequency of this occurrence so we asked him if this happens often  If there is a time to lie buddy it's now but I'm not sure he did  He said "Well I don't want to say it's often but it does happen"  Then he followed it up with a list of reasons why it happens---they come in on the boxes etc  This didn't make the situation better  Then he told us they usually only see the roaches when they turn the lights on in the kitchen  I know restaurant kitchens usually have some roaches and it's a controlled situation but he made it sound like Joe's Apartment and this roach didn't even talk to me  To finish this long story I purposely waited to write this review to see if the pest control company would contact us  We never heard from Carraba's again or their mystery pest control company and a roach out in the middle of a bunch of people in the early evening is a sign that there are probably many many more everywhere else  Too bad for the servers of Carraba's--they really are top notch  We moved nearby to Charleston's and they were so good they gained our repeat business.
Sassy glasses do have an amazing selection of glasses  That is all they have going for themOn two occasions I have gone into this store shopping for glasses the first time I went in I did find a frame I fell in love with however the sales girl was standoffish and rude to my son  I did not purchase the frames that day but was going to go back and get themOn my second visit to the store I was so put off by all of the sales staff the treated me and my sister like we were only in the store so that we could steal from them  I did not purchase the glasses for this reason and will not be going back.
Bah Humbug I have a bad case of sinus pressure (my eyes are even twitching making reading on a day off not even possible) and after getting on a full 72 bus then getting on the wrong Orbit bus (that is how confused I was w/my headache) I decided I better get my prescription filled at the brand new pretty CVS instead of my usual Walgreens on Broadway and Mill since I might as well walk home after taking a 20 minute Orbit joy rideI was surprised when the associate with inked in eyebrows super chimney sotty eyelashes (mary poppins) told me the wait would be like 20-45 minutes I should have probably just taken my prescription at that point back since that is a seriously long wait time But I figured well I can kill some time at Borders and look at art for while I gave them a half hour and after getting pan handled by 'punks' dressed better than I am I just wanted to go homeI get there and a young Ron Howard tells me another 20-40 minutes W T F I am trying not to be livid I don't want to be an asshole but are you for fucking real After I gave it an extra 30 minutes to be sure Sure I've got time to dick around in a bright flurescent space thanks Oh is that the new Oprah magazine Perfect-would much rather stand here since there are no chairs around the Pharmacy for another half hour or so than like lay down with my meds to treat my bitch of a headache RonFinally I ask for it they have it The pharmacist apologizes for the wait saying she is the only one on duty Then who the fuck are all the other fucknuts on your staff lady Are you telling me you are the only pharmicist among 8 other people milling behind the counters When I go to Walgreens there are like five people like five PHARMICISTS ready and willing to help me with my questions seek out meds with helpful advice and ready with 15 minutesOh and your generic was like 5 bucks more than Target thanksFuck this placeAnd Katie G can bite me.
I want to start by saying I've spent THOUSANDS at Lowes in the past 8 months of living in my new home my average Lowes shopping trip is between $300-$800 dollars Tonight I showed up at Lowes literally at 7:59 a minute before closing I asked an employee who was in the parking lot (wish I got his name he was a great guy bald w/ a goatee) what time they were closing tonight and he told me 8:00pm and I replied that I didn't want to be "the guy that rushes in last minute and that I would be back tomorrow" He was super nice and assured me it wasn't a problem at all that I came all this way I should do my shopping and make the trip worth while I thanked him and walked toward the entrance A female employee walked out of the entrance to throw something in the trash can that was just outside the entrance but saw me walking up and very quickly scurried back in side and forced the doors shut with her hands and locked it quickly LITERALLY AS I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER through the doors She didn't say a word just looked at me in the face as she locked the door and walked away as I could hear her loudly asking another employee "Is that against policy" I was so shocked that she didn't even care enough to at least tell me sorry we are closing or we are closed sir or ANYTHING at all for that matter and that she just slammed the doors shut and locked them as if I was a stray dog or something The gentleman employee that was in the parking lot saw what happened and was EXTREMELY caring he opened the doors for me and let me do my shopping which took me 6 mins as there were still customers in the store I rated this Lowes the lowest rating possible so everyone can read this review but that employee who cared enough to let me do my unintentional "last minute" shopping is the ONLY REASON that I will continue to shop at Lowes and not spend the thousands of dollars a year at Home Depot if that guy didn't go out of his way to let me in the store this heartless woman would've cost Lowes a loyal frequent customer and a good amount of lost revenue I will try to find the guys name and update my review Thanks.
So the boys were out for an afternoon of bike riding and drinking and my beau called me and wanted me to come join them at their last stop for a drink When I ordered a drink the waitress informs me that Chili's has a better beer (both on tap and in the bottle) selection than they do I settled for a jameson on the rocks It was getting later in the afternoon so I browsed their menu and found that Chili's has better pricing for the same pre-frozen-heated-in-a-fryer food I order some tots and another jameson to tide me over I was right the tots were frozen but the Arcadia Tavern had put regular pepper on them to make them fancy  As I was ending my second drink and eating some ice I got a very nasty surprise There was GLASS mixed in with my ice It cut open my mouth on two different spots and I left the bar with a bleeding mouth  All the manager offered us was free drink tickets That was really lame Bad customer service and poor beer selection and over priced food means we will not be going back.
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta I heard that song last time I walked in The guy that made my sandwich kept rubbing snot off his nose and didn't wash his hands He asked me if I wanted the wiz or if I was a skirt Can you call a girl a skirt I went with the wiz wanting to appear like a educated philly girl  It was gross really gross The meat tasted freezer burned and so did the fries Slathering the crap in cheese wiz only made it more apparent that I was going to have a heart attack before finishing it Don't eat here you'll be sorry Your stomach will drop kick you over and over Cheese Wiz is gross They have other things on the menu like greasy grease sloshed around in cheese or for a healthier version you can add grease soaked mushrooms and peppers to your cheese soaked brittle bun Warning - Only skirts do that When you go to Corleones you wanna be a gangsta Ok maybe not but I did want to cap the bitch that frightened me into ordering the wiz.
Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service the booth was dirty and the window sill had a inch layer of dust with some old fries and about five dead flies on it it took forever for the food to come which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest place should shut down.
I told him no Swiss cheese and they still made it and they still made it with this was cheese I had to wait a second time I would recommend coming here they don't pay attention.
I thought I would try out this location after my previous auto shop had closed and hoped being that AAA recommended it it would provide good honest service  Had an oil change/maintenance check done there and was please with the service  But when I returned to have it looked at after the engine light went on their "diagnostics" test was going to cost $105  And that wouldn't have been waived if I had the service completed there  I had to passfree diagnostics test are available everywhere don't be suckered.
Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served Then they took the meal order for my girl friend but didn't take mine One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happenedNext we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware Most restaurants automatically give those to youNext the ice in the drinks is so small you have to use a straw whether you want to or not Can't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.
I received a ring for Christmas that needed to be sized Went into this location to drop it off A salesperson by the name of Tim was at the counter I told him what I needed and he was less than thrilled to help me I had to ask to see a ring sizer I had to ask him about how long it would take He didnt offer up any info at all It was like pulling teeth I realize this wasnt a new sale and he wasnt making any money off of me BUT the ring was bought at Kay and he should have been more willing to help I usually shop at a different jewelry store and after this experience I would never step foot into another Kay jewelry store I will give Helzberg my money instead.
I really don't understand the fascination with Fairytale Brownies  They are cloyingly sweet grainy and if they weren't brown you wouldn't know they were chocolate flavored and the flavored ones leave an artificial aftertaste  We used to receive these as gifts at the office from vendors and this was always one snack to skip.
Not sure how this place has gotten any good reviews on here  Food is bad service is slow and it is on the expensive side for Mexican food  I always go to a restaurant three times before I will post a negative review on here because everyone has off days  This place was the same experience  all three times   I won't be going a fourth time.
This place is worse than the IRS at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say "sorry for the inconvenience" or "we made a mistake"  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made then Dorrie some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say "we apologize for the inconvenice"  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.
This review is specifically about the bakery  I purchased three different flavors of the mini cheesecakes vanilla bean coffee and cookie for $179 to $199 each for my husbands birthday  These were the worst example of cheesecake we have ever eaten  The flavor is waxy and taste of chemicals and there is no different flavor between any of the three  Will not purchase again expected so much more.
Over-rated over-priced and where's the filling Tastes like flavor-less boxed-cake with sugary frosting Can't believe the owner judges Cupcake Wars and doesn't change her recipe  I want some filling in the middle with a ganache icing for that price Lines out the doorI don't get it.
Well we wont be back again This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings she couldn't seem to finish her sentences and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it totally untrimmed Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered Hard as a rock They tried to tell me it was toasted but lol there was  no color at all meaning not toasted not dark I hate being bull shitted people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole I sent it back and did not get anything else If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there this is basics My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese Again bread not toasted totally white and cheese not really melted Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is Unreal The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese lol this place is a joke The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor See ya Garage If you cant make a grilled cheese mac n cheese or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it.
Worst service I have received in a long time  We were a party of four  After waiting 20 minutes to order we were told that we were given the lunch menu but that they would let us order anyway  Then our server switched but failed to tell the new server our order  Once he put it in another 20 minutes later we were told we could have a sandwich and we need to order something else  They also didn't have any white sangria left and told us they were too busy to make more  Don't waste your time  Grimaldi's up the street has better food and service.
This place was straight up NASTY I am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals I'm not a picky person I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be ediblethat was until today I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table I wasn't even willing to order something else I was disappointed.
The service here is terrible  The place was empty  We waited for fifteen minutes or more  I finally asked if we could be seated in one of the many empty tables  The answer was we do not have enough servers to seat you  We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left  Maybe they should hire a few more waitresses  These people did not care one bit if you waited forever  The worst part was only a very few tables had customers  This is the only complaint I have ever written  I will never return to this restaurant.
I have 3 words for you: FAKE BOARDING PASSESIn 2009 we tried to fly to Costa Rica from Toronto at Christmas time BIG MISTAKE To make a long story short our flight out of YYZ was delayed by 3 hours (even though it was showing on-time on the website when left our house we were later told by American Airlines that apparently the flight crew was late) and we spent 3 days alternately standing in line-ups or sitting from morning until night in various airports on stand-by for flights because we couldn't make our connection We were passed around from one enormous line-up to another (only to be sent back again) and got sent all over the USA We went from Toronto to Charlotte to Dallas to Florida and finally to San Jose Costa Rica receiving some bogus boarding passes in the process Boarding passes that they took from us and refused to give back This part involved US Airways' partner American Airlines (the AA representative told us that the flight had been oversold weeks ago and there were other passengers already in the seats we had showing on our boarding passes) and some unfriendly back and forth between the two And of course you dare not make a scene in an American airport no sirree bob otherwise those GI Joes will be all over you like white on rice We were all ready to explode especially after the second day when our luggage managed to get on a flight but we didn't so we were at the motel with only the clothes on our backs Motel folk were really nice though and they gave a discount to stranded travellers We missed out on a 3rd of our 9 day trip (all pre-paid) and were not compensated 1 penny by US Airways or GAP Adventures All the gory details took 3 single-spaced pages to spell out but suffice it to say avoid US Airways and avoid traveling during Christmas if you can.
Went in one other party was there Their poppers were cold they said they could heat them up for me You don't heat popper they are double the price and half the size of Teharu in Scottsdale Surprisingly the iced green tea wasn't very good.
Everything was fine until we saw a cockroach roaming around the shelves behind the counter where we were sitting   When we finished we were sitting there for awhile before one of the staff finally brought us our check  I wanted to get change for a tip but there was nobody at the cashier and none of the workers bothered to acknowledge us  During this time (and it was NOT busy) several workers were just standing around talking  When one of them walked by with his face buried in his phone I'd had enough  Left a 50 cent tip that was frankly too much for the lousy service but we'd have been there another 20 minutes just to get our change  The cool old-fashioned ice cream parlor we were hoping for was in actuality a dirty dump with bush league service  Derp.
This place was a huge disappointment After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides I finally relented to an order of garlic bread and was served plain stale bread For this stale bread we got charged $3 I will not be going back If you want Italian Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff Oh yeah the bread is good and complimentary.
Duh what a wasteland of crappy products Gift card forced me to pop by (in disguise).
Scale of 1-10 (single visit):7 Food6 *Drinks*3 Service7 Atmosphere7 ValueThe other Doses I've been to have been fine (though still nothing special) and I assume this was just an off night for these guys but I have to rate them according to my direct experience  Maybe I'll get to give them another try so I can change it but we'll see.
Dog Park Who are they kidding This place was crap and full of crap It looks as though people went in to this park just so their dogs could poop There were no clean up mitts and it was small and stinkyWhoever designed this dog park should be kicked in the balls No grass all gravel and the one water spigot That's right -  outside of the park Brainiack I wish I would have yelped this before I went What a waste.
At a recent visit to Sourdough Pizza we had a bad experience It started off with the sad looking and very nasty tasting non-edible want to be Philly Cheese steak sandwiches They were frozen steak-um which starts off insulting Philly The want to be beef was not even chopped up We decided they needed to be sent back and the waitress then proceeded to be rude from that point forward because of this  She replied with a smirk "You will still have to pay for them" That is not good business sense making your customers pay for food they have not even taken a bite of and are unsatisfied with The waitress darts off and lets the cook know what just happened He came out acting rude as well and making comments like "What do you want me to do cut them up for you" During this whole time a manager or owner looked on but did not approach the table to figure out what was going on Another bad business move to not want to try and resolve unhappy customers We will certainly not visit this establishment again and advise all our friends family and clients not visit either.
What closes early on a Friday night in Scottsdale DD does  Without knowing it we went there later in the night not knowing what time they close-9pm  We weren't really greeted by a hello or welcome but more like look at their watch and a sigh  We said sorry "Can we still come in or not it's ok" They still sat us And we waited and waited never greeted or acknowledged Waiters racing back and forth never looking our way  The place was full so not sure if this was their way to get rid of us  Five minutes later  we had to ask for our waitress which the one that seated us raced by our table several times ignoring us all together  The only person that served us was the bartender   She was the only bright person in the entire place We ordered two drinks and the portobello and brie fondue plate  Drinks were great  The dish on the other hand was a bowl of what looked like soup pieces of bread and badly cut pieces of tomatoes cucumbers and carrots None of the plate really looked good but we ate it Very salty fondue Not enough bread Wasn't impressed  Oh and there were typos in the menu.
This location is closed - apparently being demolished And yet they are still selling groupons with no notice of this.
I don't trust these folks at all  I was contacted by Quicken when I signed up for Lending Tree (a big mistake don't use Lending Tree)  When the agent called I told him I was looking for a 10 year re-finance at a fixed rate  I specifically told him I needed to know what the best rate and the costs would be  It took several calls from the agent before he finally told me their rate and cost  The rate was 1% higher than a competing lender and their costs were twice as much  I told him I would go with the other less expensive lender and then he got real aggressive telling me that Quicken was the best lender in the business (yeah right)  Once I finally got him to understand that cost was the deciding factor he then recommended I let him review the loan docs from the other lender  I didn't even know this guy why would anyone let a stranger look over your loan docsAfter finally getting off the call I started receiving repeated calls from another Quicken agent  I finally took one of the calls to tell her to stop contacting me  Since then the emails have been coming fast and furious even when I replied asking them not to contact me at all  One of the emails my request came from the original lending agent saying something to the effect of "call me and let's set up an appt to discuss your loan"If you want to avoid being pestered indefinately NEVER contact Quicken Loans.
I've been here a few times as well as the location in Scottsdale Both are always tremendously busy which I can typically deal with I've tried a few things and really the veggie & house frittatas are the only things on the menu which I feel aren't overpriced for what you get but their food is good so this is - was - an occasional stop for me Today though after waiting at the counter for nearly 5 minutes someone finally came to take my order Only to refuse to make me the thing I wanted Yes you read that correctly He "offered" me something else from the menu because the frittatas apparently "take to long to make and we're really slammed" I was beyond stunned and left out of pure principle I can think of 9 other better ways to handle that situation Even worse I think the guy helping me was the manager (Here's an idea advise me that there will be a long wait offer me a complimentary drink maybe even bump an order or two ahead of mine so it doesn't cause a backup It wasn't like I was in a hurry - I even brought a book to hang out for a while) If an item on the menu is that much of an issue it shouldn't be on the menu I really hope owners peruse these reviews from time to time so they can address this sort of atrocious customer service Not that I'll ever be back to find out but they might like to know how their business is being handled.
I've stopped in twice during normal and was told they were currently not serving If third try is a charm we may never know.
went at about 3:30 wed trying to beat the crowdonly waited about 10 minutesim glad we didn't wait longer because it definitely wasn't worth waiting formy wife ordered shrimp scampi and had to send it backthe shrimp were tough as rubberi had a 12" pizza that was no big dealit was nothing special at allthe place is very loudif only the food was as good as the servicewe wont be back.
I am disappointed that they are closed without any signs on the door or message on their voicemail I loved Picazzo's in Sedona and was excited about one opening here in Phoenix so I planned an office lunch party for the holiday and was shocked when we went there and saw the lights out and doors locked Not a good way to keep customers no matter how good the food is.
it's my day to whineDO NOT go to NextCare Urgent Care off Tatum Blvd Took my 11 year old there Saturday morning at 9:00am They wanted to take a blood sample to send off Their 2 employees were ineptkept poking her and "couldn't find a vein" Had to leave there and take her to Sonora Quest by Scottsdale Shea They were awesome and I think we were there for all of 5 minutes total - with check-in time To cap it all off NextCare hasn't even called me with results Had to call themand of course there's no direct line to reach them ANNOYED  My family and I simply will not be back.
My mother in law INSISTED on this place for dinner this weekend saying they had the best Mexican food she ever had :/We roll up and the hostesses didn't even greet us (there were 3 of them at the podium) They were rude and were too busy talking amongst themselves to even notice we were standing there I finally had to say hello to get noticed I wasn't happy about this They gave us a pager saying it would be around a 30 minute wait There were TONS of people sitting around waiting for seats We were called for our table about 30 minutes later By this time the front was getting crazy busy with people waiting for tables As we were seated we noticed of course all the people at the front waiting for a table-then we noticed all the empty tablesa serious WTF moment :/ There were at least FIVE empty tables just in our section alone So they were either purposely creating a wait OR were seriously understaffedOur waiter was nice but he seemed to be in a constant rush We ordered guacamole which is made at the table we received a bowl with large chunks of avocado which is NOT guacamole He just sliced it into a bowl and stirred it a minute with a seasoning packet and served it Again I was NOT a happy camper All four of our dishes came with "spanish rice" This "rice" was obviously a boxed mix with frozen peas The rice was hard to bite into and seemed out of place as it looked like a fried rice mix it was bizarreI ordered the chili rellano and the chilies seemed fresh and had good flavor but the rest of the meal was very bland My husband had the shrimp fajitas and he took two bites and REFUSED to eat anything else on his plateThis place makes cheap horrible food and charges $15/plate for boxed crap It's only attraction is that it's in a nice location and charges a fortune for everything which attracts people who don't know any better (like my mother in law) If you're one of those folks who thinks that just cause it's expensive that means it must be good then come running to this place-I'm sure they would be happy to take advantage of you If you actually have taste (and taste buds) go to Valle Luna or Los Olivos or for God's sake even Filiberto's would be better than this place Don't say you haven't been warned :/Too Long-Didn't Read version: bad overpriced food and service suck mmkay.
Is it wrong for buffets to make you more dispondant/angry as you eatI've only had to leave in the middle of a buffet one time before I was full becaues of seriously bad food and this was number 2 The food was practically flavourless - the Honey chicken tasted as though they took Spaghetti-O sauce and some sugar mixed in and called it a sauce so much other food was completely void of any flavour The only halfway decent food was the chow meinEven the service was lacking - no one asked how the food was or if there was anything I needed The cashier barely muttered the amount I was due and that was itYou're much better off at other places.
Gross Way too expensive for what you get I ordered a turkey sandwich How can you go wrong Right Bread was stale turkey actually had a weird taste and the toppings were lack luster and practically non-existent to say the least Prices were so high too Almost 11$ for a large sandwich meant to split with my hubby but we just threw it out and ate somewhere else Totally indelible Won't be back Try cheba hut  for one of kind sandwiches at a killer price.
The money-gram service fee is $14 meanwhile at Walmart only $9 They using a phone call instead if a filling form which is I have to repeated the questions & the answers many times They only accepted cash not debit card So when I have to take the cash from the ATM near their door it charged me $3 I had to do it coz I have no time to find Walmart  otherwise I preferred to go to Walmart It suck.
As a  a long time Flo's customer the new layout of this location is horrible The hostess stand has been moved to the side allowing waiting  customers to flow into the dining room and lean against your table while you're eating   Absolutely refuse the first table behind the hostess stand it is a miserable experience When I complained about it Flo said its because they were busy Well on my job when I earn the money that I spend at flos I can't provide poor customer service just because we are busy Bottom line with flos is they have gotten too big  making money is more important that the client experience Find another establishment until they put clients first.
We came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live We were very excited to see a BBQ joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food Being from KC I know what good BBQ taste like and some of the best places are set up like this one but this wasn't even close when it came to good or even acceptable BBQ They had a huge smoker in back but it wasn't used for the BBQ we had Since we live very close we really wanted to like this place because the closest decent BBQ place is 20 miles away We bought a sample plate because we love BBQ and wanted to get a good idea of what their's was like The food tasted old like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it The beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an old burnt taste The smoker in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was done in an oven a week before Like I said very disappointed don't waste your money.
Awe I hate writing bad reviews I know they hurt :(I am writing because I REALLY wanted to like this place I have heard good things from a good friend of mineWent here on a date with my lovely girlfriend for a girls night out Light sushi fare and cocktails Ordered the Porn Star martini love the name hated the drink was there any vodka in it NO it was watermelon juiceOur waitress left us hanging high and dry when it came to ordering food and new cocktailsShe seemed off of her meds The runner brought us the wrong food TWO times and took 45 minutes for the right ones to be servedAgain I am sorry for the bummer review but I wont be returning for slow service or bad food and cocktails.
Looks like at one time it used to be a very scenic course However with greens keepers mowing the grass ( at 2pm ) it was loud & obnoxious Couldn't tee off nor putt due to their presence on the holes No beverage cart either They didn't honor a discount card my boyfriend had purchased The golf cart had a used score card & the ice chest had dirty melted ice.
Food was ok nothing to tell my friends about If your in the area come but not a place to say lets go eat at Bitz-ee.
Worst massage EVER They were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early(Sounds like less than an hour) Then I asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that couldn't squash a grape in a fruit fight And then when it's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life NEWS FLASH You can get $40 massage's all day on groupon There are better places you just have to look.
Do not use this lady She is not trustworthy We were supposed to have invitations sent 6 weeks prior or the big day We could not get a hold of her and when we did it was excuse after excuse Finally the invites went out three weeks prior to wedding after several mistakes.
Disorganized and inefficient  Waited 20 minutes for a sandwich name called confirmed my order and I drive 10 miles home  Wrong sandwich  Call them up and told I can come back and pick up the right one  I guess that if you spend your money at this location be sure to unwrap and physically inspect the sandwich before leaving property.
How this place has great reviews is completely beyond me  I have never been in a dirtier less visually appealing salon with the most unfriendly employees ever  I went here specifically because of  the reviews  Maybe I got spoiled living in CA (where every salon I went to for 11 years was clean nicely decorated and had great employees) but in my opinion this place a dumpUpon entering the salon for the first time I had a hard time finding the front desk  It's hidden around the corner  The first thing you see when you walk in is a crappy shelving unit holding dirty goggles and towels  And don't even get me started about the paint job or rest of the decor in this place  I felt like I needed a shower upon entering this place  When I finally made my way around to the front desk (if you can call it that) I didn't even get a "hi" "hello"not even an "f you you're interrupting me while I'm staring at my nails"  *I* the customer greeted the employee with a smile and a "Hello"  I told her it was my first time at this salon and that I'd like to purhcase five tans in a level 2 bed  I didn't even ask her any annoying questions because I'm capable of reading the board on the wall myself yet she treated me like I just asked her for a kidney  She threw a clipboard in my direction and said "Fill this out"  I filled out the portion with my name and address and began checking yes or no to the additional questions on the waiver (that silly legal form that protects them from being sued)  She yelled at me that I didn't need to answer the questions and that I should just sign the bottom  Ok sure  I can not answer any of the important questions that you might need to know about a new clientlike whether or not I burn easily etc  I mentioned to her that I had not been tanning in over a year so I didn't want to go to the full time  Typically when you go to a new salon they will recommend a time based on what they know about their beds  She took my money and in the most annoyed voice ever said "How long"  Ummmmm I just told you I hadn't been tanning in a while so again I haven't been tanning in a while  How long do you recommend  Her response "Seven"  A question  Why are you asking me  I know nothing about your level two beds and since you didn't have me answer any of those silly questions on your waiver I doubt you could make a proper recommendation anyway  So sure I guess seven is good  Another customer happened to walk in behind me during this exchange and the girl behind the counter said "follow me" and didn't say a word to the other customer  A "I'll be with you in just a moment" would have been completely appropriate and normal in this situationSo I follow her down a narrow bright red hallway (that it looks like my nine year old painted) to a room with a flimsy folding door  She then tells me to bring my dirty googles and towel back to the front and drop them in the baskets  Waitwhat  Do you want me to wipe down the bed and do a load of laundry for you too  Why am I paying you for me to do your job for you  I have NEVER been asked to clean up after myself at a tanning salonEVER  This made me wonder if they even go in there and clean the bed after I'm done  So I fold my door behind her and latch it with the flimsy lock they've placed because a regular door lock won't work  I put on my lotion in the tiny room (banging my elbows on the walls and bed in the four inch square space I have) and step into the stand up bed  The lights eventually flicker on and I notive SEVERAL long hairs caught in the wiring surrounding the bed  Now I realize this is perfectly normal but if they cleaned the bed every once in a while they might pick out the long hairs that have been there for over two weeks now (as I've noticed in my subsequent visits)The other two times I've been I've dealt with another girl who seems a little more friendly but I have to say I'll be finishing up my five tan package and never return to this little hole again  This place leaves so much to be desired  For the amount they charge they need to clean up a little repaint and consider having the employees do the cleaning instead of the customers  First impressions are everything people.
if $20 per person for all-you-can-eat sushi sounds too good to be true then it's probably too good to be true  the 1st red flag should have been AUCE sushi  think about it if you were the owner of the restaurant would you put out 5 star sushi so that people can scarf it all down for $20i guess it's just as much my fault for believing a korean barbecue restaurant would have semi-spectacular sushiwhatever you do don't let the hostess convince you to sit in the little "black hole" room with the "sushi" sign on the doorway even if you're only going to order the AYCE sushi (which is a mistake in itself)we were left in there for about 15mins to peruse() the menu  we finally checked off a few rolls and were waiting for the waiter to come back and take our order sheet all the while we could see the sushi chef standing there twiddling his thumbs secretly laughing that he was getting paid to do nothing  i finally figured i could just take the slip of paper up to him myself so i did  he seemed a little taken aback but took the paper reluctantly and pretended to start our order  i say that because it seemed to take another 10 or so minutes for them to bring us the 1st role  by then we were so famished that we scarfed it down like a pack of rabid wolves  it tasted ok but i couldn't tell if it was because i was so grateful to have something to eat or if it really tasted greati've heard it said that they purposefully bring you a roll every 10-15 minutes so that you won't order more than you can eat (in which the rules state that any left over food will trump the AYCE price of $20 and they reserve the right to change the pricing structure to full price for each roll/nigiri that is not eaten)  fair enough but anyone who's ever eaten at an AYCE joint knows full well that if you eat too slow you will invariably eat about 1/3 of what you would have eaten if you were allowed to eat at your own "natural" pace (haha)  so by the time we got  to the 3rd of 5 rolls we ended up choking down the less than stellar 2 remaining rolls in fear of being charged the full price for the whole mealyeah i must admit that it was not such a great idea to order "fillers" such as tempura but the batter was like a batter that you would find on a beer battered onions rings at the local BBQ joint  it was thick doughy and tasteless  i guess i'm used to thin light and crispy tempura batter that i've had at other japanese restaurantsif you plan on taking me there for the AYCE sushi and say that you'll pay for me my wife and 1 y/o daughter don't be offended if i decline you'll thank me later b/c i'll have saved you a ton of money.
My problem is not with the pet supplies or the quality food they carry it was with the GROOMER  My golden was brought in for a bath and brush and came home with CLIPPER BURN and OPEN SORES on his behind  He was matted there from swimming in the pool and I consented to shaving his hindquarters shaved  When I explained how I felt when I saw my dog and his obvious discomfort with the groomer there was no empathy no apology and no culpability She didn't even put anything on the affected areas to soothe his discomfort before she sent him home  She will get no return business from me and no referrals EVER   The owner did however refund my money when I asked for a refund  She did apologize for the incident.
Absolutely disgusting  Horrible fries rancid tasting oily beef  Careless staff Way overpriced Steer clear.
Tried breakfast lunch and dinner here and the food was terrible  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere I would not recommend this placeBreakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine but the oatmeal was overcooked and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full  Steak salad- ordered the steak medium rare  It came overly smoked completely overcooked and tasted like beef jerky  The spinach was also not freshVegetable soup- tasted fine but nothing special Chicken Caesar- the dressing was fine but the lettuce was somewhat blackened  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked  Tater Tots- tasted fine although a bit dry  Overall this is at best a two star restaurant.
I just got back from lunch at this place today  I've been to many places in the downtown area for lunch (I work in the area) and this was in my opinion by far my worst experience eating lunch at a downtown establishment  We arrived at the restaurant at about 11:50 am  I arrived with my party a group of 5 and nobody else was waiting in line  As the waitress (they don't have any hosts/hostesses) was trying to figure out how to accomodate our group of 5 she seated the group of 2  that came in from behind us  No big deal - that was a more typical number for them to seatAbout a minute later she sat us next to the cash register  Next to us were two ladies who had ordered their food to go and were still waiting  I had overheard one of the ladies comment to the other lady wondering what was taking their food so long  An omen of things to comeWe received water fairly quickly then was given soup before we ordered  The soup was fine compared to similar establishments although it only had tofu in it rather than maybe one or two pieces of chickenWe ordered our food: two orders of drunken noodles one spicy green bean with chicken one ginger chicken with brown rice and I ordered the spicy eggplant with brown rice  Not a complicated order  Especially when considering the menu is simple: they have like 14-16 lunch specials and the only difference in price is whether or not you order a different kind of protein  It's cookie cutter generic Thai food  We ordered at around 11:55 amMy group and I are all friends so we were conversing for awhile without thinking about how long it was taking  By about 12:25 pm we were wondering what was going on  I looked over to the table to my right which is a table of 10 right next to the storefront window of the restaurant  A group of 10 people that had been seated after us had already gotten their food and were in the process of paying their checks  I then saw the group of 2 who were seated just before us finishing up their meals as well  Not a good signAt about 12:30 pm I got up from my seat and asked the lady at the cash register if we were going to be getting our meals anytime soon  She asked me where I was seated noticed I came from right around the corner of the register didn't really answer me turned around to some people and started speaking in a different language to either the cooks or the other waitresses  I sat back down and she darted by shortly thereafter saying 5 more minutesNow I was checking my phone constantly  At 12:38 two orders came out: one of the drunken noodles and the spicy green bean with chicken  My two friends began eating as we had already been waiting for so long  Two more orders came out at 12:40: the other drunken noodle and the ginger chicken  I looked to my right: the group of 10 had gotten up and walked out of the restaurant  I then got my dish  Needless to say I was not happyAs we hurriedly scarfed down our food we asked for the check  We noticed that the two dishes that had ordered brown rice received an additional $2 charge when the menu said $1  I immediately darted up from my seat and went to the cashier and notified her of the problem  To her credit she fixed it immediatelyI then started eating my food  Considering I had to wait over 45 minutes for it it was not even all that hot - temperature or spice wise  I bit into several pieces of eggplant that were still cold - like the stirfry hadn't gotten all the freezer burn out of it just quite and now it was just cold instead of frozen  I had also asked for it to be spicy hot and it wasn't even close to even being mild spicy  For a dish that is supposed to be "spicy eggplant" and I ordered it hot: well it wasn't particularly authentic Thai spicyWe asked them to split the check five ways by giving the cashier 5 credit cards (which is just the norm for downtown joints these days)  I asked her why our order took so long and why a table that had 10 people seated after us were able to get their food eat and pay before we even received our dishes  The only answer I got was thank you for being patient and that the group of 10 had called in their order  There were no apologies and no credit to our meals offered  It then took them a long time to get us our checksThe service here was ridiculous  Apparently they treat people who call in their orders with more priority than other guests  (And yet many take out orders waited near us) That's not quite a solution for a poorly run restaurant  Nor was the food all that great either  I will not be coming back here and I would advise that anyone else interested in a normal length lunch not even bother either  But if you don't care that your order comes out 45 minutes after you order it during lunch you get overcharged for items you ordered and enjoy subpar non-authentic food well then by all means go ahead and come here.
My experience at this salon could not have been worse I was the maid of honor for my bestie's wedding and a group of 6 of us went in the morning before the wedding to get pedis and the bride also got a mani The lady at the front desk was the grumpiest woman on earth but whatever We got our pedis and it was mostly enjoyable The technicians were not all excellent but for the most part we were happy with the results The environment was comfortable and clean and it was a relaxing morningThe problem was that just 5 hours later the bride's nails were already chipping She wasn't washing dishes or doing anything crazy but she was running some errands and doing the normal last minute stuff before a wedding Unfortunately even though we had made a big deal about this being the bride the nail techs did not recommend something longer lasting like acrylic nails or even gels for the bride so we hadn't thought much about the mani she got until it started chipping Ok fine We decide to go in the morning of the wedding and have them touch up her mani assuming they will do that for us for no charge because it was their work that hadn't held up False They charged her for a whole new manicure So here's my friend totally in tears the morning of her wedding and these people are telling her she should have got a gel manicure instead (she never gets manicures so she didn't even know what that was) and telling her it was her fault that her nails chipped within 5 hours of having them done It was so ridiculous Needless to say I'll never go back to this place and recommend you skip it too Awful customer service Awful attitudes.
Absolute rip off have had multiple friends and co-workers get ripped off at this mechanic Co worker had a hole in her gas tank they quoted her over 600$ because they said it was a specialty part in a Toyota Corolla Had her call a nearby mechanic and they quoted her $300 When she called Fletcher's back they dropped the price to match the other quote She still had her car fixed since it was already there but I wouldn't trust these people as far as I could throw them.
If you want to drop $250-$300 & absolutely not impress a date this is the place Stuffy Pretentious uncomfortable & Mediocre Summarizes This Venue The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive (1st class) You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant (Still 1st class) "So what's the problem" you ask Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs to get your table(OK it's a popular high end place & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share) So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate or get treated as such Now the food does taste good but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish But how much am I paying for this dish It's only half a cut of the fish Despite all the mastication it is very hard to swallow Somehow you finish your dish (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer) So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters "Fave Pick" on desert Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the "you cheapskate evil eye" walking out of this restaurant Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet $5 tip also will get you a "are you kidin' me look as well".
Unfortunately this was the worst sushi I've ever had The rolls and other pieces were edible but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner) wow.
This will NEVER be a shopping destination for me Unless I need to visit THE APPLE STORE I'm staying awayFor the most part the center is a collection of OVER PRICED restaurants and clubsIf YOU need your ego (or other parts) stroked by barely 21 year old female WANNA-BEE'S  Take a VIAGRA and your wallet with youThe parking availability is terriblePlus the Valet reserved zones have made it shopper unfriendly.
Poorly organized dirty and crappy selection of everything Not really much redeeming about this store Sad even for a Walmart.
Rude staff bad tasting yogurt.
We ordered the shrimp lo mein and beef and vegetable dish The lo mein has horrible bland no flavor even with extra sauce The vegetables with the beef were raw I never had such bad food at any other pei wei before.
I never thought I'd be leaving a review for a grocery store but last night's experience at the deli was so God-awful I had to pick up a few items for the house and suddenly craved fried chicken Rather than going to nasty KFC I decided to pick some up from their deliThe lady who takes your order is rude She was talking to a co-worker while I was waiting to place my order and didn't stop talking to said co-worker until I said "excuse me - should I come back"Then I ordered the 8 piece (for me and the family) with two sides The sides aren't listed on the menu so I asked her what the sides were She proceeded to (without even looking at me) point to the right and said "there"The sides were terrible The mac n cheese was almost gone No mashed potatoes I was left with seafood salad and coleslaw I take everything home and was so livid when I took the first bite of chicken There was NO CHICKEN on the inside How is that even possible It was just burnt skin I would have been better off at KFC.
My last experience at The Breakfast Club will be just that my last  Living downtown I try and support downtown business and frequent establishments within walking distance of my condo  I've had a few positive experiences here and  more than a few negative experiences but my girlfriend likes the place (or she used to anyway) so when she comes downtown for the weekend we make the trek here  The food is average somethings are well done (good Bennies) some you could get just as good or better almost anywhere  I can name at least 5 breakfast places in Phoenix that I feel have better food at a more competitive priceThe drinks used to be what kept me coming back as I felt this place had one of the best Bloody Mary's in town  My last experience here was a total let down and I should have known something was up when our server asked if we wanted "spicy" or "non-spicy" when we ordered our drinks a question that has never been asked once in the nearly 2 years I've been ordering drinks here  My "non-spicy" tasted totally different than anything I've been served there and not in a good way  My girlfriend's "spicy" tasted like someone added a pound of horseradish to it  The drinks are also way over priced $10 for a large and $7 for a small I have no problem paying premium price for a premium product but these no longer fit in that category  The staff is what solidified my decision to cross this off the list of places I frequent as I've only read about service this horrible and never actually experienced it myself until now  I'll start off by saying the service at the Downtown Breakfast Club has always been hit or miss with many more misses than hits  Some of the waitstaff has been very good most has been not so good  I'm really not that hard to wait ontake my order bring me my food refill my water check in once to see if everything is OK and you can expect a good tip  To illustrate my last visit here's a timeline:Checked in with hostess for party of 2 was told 20-30 minutes  Waited almost an hour and watched a total lack of control or caring as people would just walk up and seat themselves at the outdoor seating and nothing would be said by the staff  If the outdoor seating is a free for all like sitting at the bar just let me know and I'll seat myselfFinally had a table waited 10-15 minutes before our server came over  Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered our drinks and food right away  Bloody Mary's took about 15 minutes to get to us and food was another 20-25  Once the food arrived we asked for ketchup which I feel is a fairly simple request and the server said she would be right back with it  Apparently right back to her means 15 minutes and when she appeared with it and we total her to forget about it since we were already 80% done with our food she seemed a bit put off that we would have the audacity to ask for something and not bow at her feet when she got around to getting it to us  Was the food good would you like more water can I get you anything else  Don't ask our server because she wouldn't know not once did anyone stop by our table and ask even one of these basic questions My advise to the owner of this establishment would be kill it with fire  This location is destroying your brand and had I never been to the Scottsdale location I would never have given this one as many chances and I have  I would rather eat stale Fruity Pebbles with month old milk then eat here again.
Snippy waitress Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted That is not a Caesar salad  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio  bread  if they had any That is not bruschetta  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable The chef is obviously very high on himself  I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there.
Very poor service  Went in for late afternoon lunch (3:00) and the restaurant was less than half full but looked like a good number of servers working  We were sat at a table and there we sat for 10 minutes without ever being acknowledged by any of the servers that walked by our table - after 10 min we walked out   Good service isn't hard people - it's not rocket science.
Anyone who thinks this place has good gyros has not had a good gyro and I feel bad for them  Although getting a good gyro is really not an easy task  If you are ever in Seattle go to Mr Gyro's on Greenwood Ave and you will understand what a good gyro isThis gyro had meat tomato and onion  That is hardly how you make a gyro  Not to mention the Tzatziki sauce was awful  The pasta salad was okay  The lady taking the order -  how do I say this:  Not rude but almost there  Not friendly but not rude but not exactly chipper  This is the kicker:  I saw they had a gyro with pasta for 650 (special) so I ordered a gyro She asked me what side I wanted so I had her say what the choices were  She told me soup pasta salad fries and steamed veggies  So I chose the fries  She then told me the total was 10 dollars and change  I was likewhat  She repeated the total  Changing gears and clarifying it wasn't my hearing that was in question I asked for further details on why the price jumped 4 dollars with choosing fries instead of the pasta salad  She told me the pasta salad was on special  Still not believing this and that there must be more to it I then asked if the gyro's were the same size and she said yes  At this point I was tempted to just cancel the order based on the logic of this restaurant in charging 4 more dollars for a difference between choosing fries vs pastaand that the gyro was probably going to suck  Once again I paid for not listening to my intuition.
even the air is saturated with grease i literally went straight to Kohl's and bought a shirt off their clearance rack to wear back to the rest of my work day.
OVERPRICED AND OVERRATEDI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas  $2546The mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag  Plesto sauce was okayThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement  Two thick slices of overdone beef two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that)  When I say thick I mean 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread  These sandwhiches were $950 eachWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing nothing else)We also got two diet cokes  In a can  For $225 each  They did'nt offer a glass ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge but no nothing nietThis place might be okay if you are in the area at the building working or visiting someone but we drove from Ahwatukee  So not worth it  Do not drive to this place  Do not go out of your way for this place.
I hate giving bad reviews Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight Awesome.
I also bought a Dealfind deal for $39 for "4 hours of professional house cleaning" and have had the same experience - called couldn't leave a message because v-mail was full emailed through their website with no response called and left a message with no response Getting a Dealfind credit today STAY AWAY.
EW That about captures it We were so excited to see a new Fox Restaurant Concept open up in town Also we are HUGE oyster and seafood fans and that's why we were so curious about this restaurant -- especially when they have a huge oyster area up front and state they ship the oysters in fresh every day However there is NO WAY these oysters were fresh They had a mushy/creamy consistency that made it impossible to want to finish them We also tried the shrimp cocktail and jar of crab appetizers Neither one of these were disgusting but they weren't good The shrimp cocktail from Costco is much better than this one was and cheaper The crab was over cooked and extremely pricey for the quality and amount you receive This place is expensive to try and not worth it My advice is skip Little Cleo's and try a different Fox Restaurant Concept instead.
I have to say I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint  One of the worst meals and dining experiences I have had at least in regard to sushi  Where do I start  Do I start with the server who helped us at the sushi bar  She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor  I did not think it was that tough to serve up a Coke and a beer but it proved to be a request beyond their ability  From there it went down hill  My two hand rolls were loosely rolled and almost fell apart as I ate them  In addition there was little to no flavor  Then came the 9-11 roll and that was pretty good though for the money it was not a lot of food  Next my Chilean Sea Bass came and it was definitely overcooked  I could have sent it back but at this point I just wanted to get the meal over with and leave  What followed was the clincher that sealed the deal and allowed me to call this the absolute worst sushi I have ever had  The last roll I had was the spider roll  Anyone who has had a spider roll knows that it is made with soft shell crab  Well my spider roll had plenty of shell but it certainly lacked the crab  I have had lots of soft shell crab made many ways and hands down this was the worst  I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be  Eat at your own peril  If you want better sushi than what is served at Stingray just go to your local market  Yes the sushi is that bad there.
Nice try but no cigar as they say  There's not enough shade to enjoy this park during the day most of the year  There's no grass  It's too small for a big dog to really run  The trashy people that frequent it don't clean up after their dogs so you really need to watch your step  Worst of all people ignore the signage and bring their un-neutered dogs into the park  On a recent foray the next two people to enter the park after me had un-neutered males who immediately tried to hump my spayed female  The sign in front of the park clearly states that the city "highly recommends" only spayed/neutered pets in order to avoid aggressive behavior"  Makes me think they probably don't get their dogs shots either  I moved to downtown to avoid driving excessive distances but it seems like I need to go to the suburbs to enjoy a dog park where the owners are responsible.
I was looking for a better pizza than my Little Caesars or Dominos near my home Being the discounter I found that Papa John's had a decent pizza for a nice price I built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment Soon I received a confirmation email with all my order information and an ETA of about 20 mins or so I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up When he arrived the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas Clearly not our order  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number I was EXTREMELY disappointed with our experience I never write reviews-certainly not a bad one- however I needed to tell you readers Rosati's is worth the gas OR try another location.
We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up  I mean we were in jeans and t-shirts but didn't look like bums  The food was terrible too  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find  They claim their pasta is homemade and "al dente" but really it was just undercooked  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard or sticking together  I doubt we'll ever come back.
VEGANS AND HEALTH FOOD PEOPLE BEWAREI have a fair amount of legitimate food allergies so of course I get to be the wonderfully annoying soul who gets to ask the kitchen what is in everything So much to my surprise I learned that every single one of their salad dressings has sugar in it why I'm not too sure but according to their cooks that's the case Even the quinoa is cooked with chicken broth and the lemon sauce that is pre-mixed into it has dairy in it SO EVEN quinoa which should be a no brainer on the vegan front is in fact not vegan The salads which should be the healthiest option are laden in sugary dressings It'd be nice if they really sat down with someone who knows their business on the health food and vegan fronts and stopped making asinine decisions like putting chicken broth on vegetables and making all salad dressings with sugarAlso if you are going to put on a front of being a health conscious restaurant your employees should be prepared to get a lot of questions about ingredients from the truly health conscious.
I reserved a carwent to go pick it up and they said my credit was to low to rent from themwhen the hell did they run my creditscam I rented from hertz no problemsnever will use budget.
I didn't get a chance to try the food here but Yelp won't let me post a review without any stars so I choose one because I looked forward to trying this restaurant but when I got there I couldn't go inside because they have a "no firearms" sign posted prominently  Since both of us in our party take our own personal safety seriously by carrying concealed firearms we went somewhere else to eat Good way to turn away customers but at least we discovered Pita Jungle the food there was great and no silly "No Firearms" signs to turn away law abiding customers Seriously do you think a person intent on robbery or mayhem would heed those signs.
I loved this place when I moved in  I thought it was perfect  I had a great view from my balcony steps away from Pita Jungle and Lola Coffee  There was a park right across the street for my dogs to run around in  I didn't think much of it when then management changed from Greystar to Birkshire  Didn't see any huge differences  They seemed really friendly until I decided to move out  And then they make it their job to screw me out of every last dollar to my nameI will admit I had a fast move out  I forgot a box in the apartment and I didn't have a maid service come in and do a professional cleaning  I figured paying a few hundred dollars wasn't that big of a deal to save me the hassleAnd then I got the $1300 bill  Yes you read that correctly  There are two zeros at the end of that number  They charged me $1300 to clean a 700 sf apartment  I did what any sane person in my situation would do and I refused to pay it  That is until I was sent to collections and faced destroying my credit and rental historySo I settled it with the collection agency and moved on with my life  I genuinely thought that Roosevelt Square was done ruining my life  I was wrong again Almost a year later I put in an application for another apartment complex and was told that my credit report shows that I STILL owe money to Roosevelt Square and that they cannot rent to me unless I can provide them with documentation that this debt was paidSo I called Roosevelt Square and SURPRISE they have no record of my settlement with them  In fact they came up with another $500 that they claim I still owe them  My only option at that point was to contact the debt collection agency  They were able to provide me with a copy of my settlement in full letter in under an hour  A debt collection agency was more helpful and more competent than this joke of an officeRoosevelt Square looks really nice is in a great location and has a bunch of really awesome amenities  But so do all of the other apartment complexes in the area  Do yourself a favor  Move somewhere else and stay away from this bottomless money pit.
We discovered after returning home that we left an item in the room WE know exactly where it was when we left After three phone calls to the hotel to see if it was turned in we have given up They claim there was nothing found I rather expected this after our stay and after reading other reviews about others leaving items behind and them not being recovered I resigned to replacing the item Holiday inn did send me a survey which I filled out answering questions that reflect the same experience I shared here on Yelp In my original review i forgot to mention that the wifi did not work either just as others have stated in other reviews.
Review for RIP SURFER CLASS  I just want to clarify that this review if for the Fitness class and is in no way a reflection of the spa  I have been to the spa in the past and it is a beautiful first class experience  Unfortunately I cannot say the same of the fitness classA bunch of girlfriends and I decided it would be fun to try out a new workout  There were 9 of us and we made a reservation ahead of time for the Rip Surfer class  Here is the description:"SurfSet reinvigorates the typical cardio and weighttraining routine by fusing all the elements of surfing into a high intensity fat-burning session  SurfSet shakes things up continually challenging the body with dynamic angles a fast tempo and an unstable surface"I'm really sad and disappointed to say that the ONLY thing true about this description is the unstable surface  There were two instructors that evening and they started by splitting us up into two groups  One group did the surf set and crank while others moved to another room to do TRX  Then we swapped  The class was supposed to be 60 min long  I don't think we got a total 60 min workout  Between explaining things and moving all around  We may have gotten a 45-50 min workout  Additionally we wanted to do this experience as a GROUP  Which is why we signed up as a GROUP-- not to be split upWe may have gotten 20 min of actual workout on the surf boards  The rest of the workout was done on TRX and Crank machines  I did not pay $20 to workout on machines that I could use at my regular gym  I paid $20 to try a new workout  The workout itself was NOT at all high intensity  Not to take away from the instructors who were very fit for their age but we were a group of 9 women who work out regularly  There was not a single person who found this workout to be physicially challenging or exciting  It was unorganized mundane and quite frankly a waste of time and money in my opinionBeing that the Princess is a top tier spa our expecations were set higher  Between the $20 and $5 spent tipping the valet (because self parking was no where to be found and by the way- the valet guy actually tried charging me $8 for parking also)-- total expense for this "experience" was $25  Again the spa is fabulous and I would go back but this Surf class was a total joke and I will not be returning  Terribly disappointing because it seems like a really cool concept and it is not offered in many places.
Went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed (and disgusted) in the place  I literally STUCK to the floor  It was gross  Their carpet is nasty  The bathroom wasn't much better  I mean don't get me wrong I don't expect a lot from a sports bars but I also don't expect to stick to the floor  The waitress I had was great and the drinks were cheap and strong - but not enough so to bring me back in the future 2 thumbs down.
They didn't fully honor the oil change coupon discount told me I needed a lot of stuff that I didn't need which I declined They didn't seem trustworthy the next day I found a screw in the driver's side tire - coincidence I was getting my oil changed at Cobblestone before and will not deviate again.
The sad part is I USED to give them a 5 star rating I USED to tell my friends and family to go there I USED to love them so much But here is what they have been doing the last few appointments and I just can't stand it You make an appointment with the hygienist you have come to love and respect This person was like a friend and you didn't even mind getting your teeth cleaned and I HATE the dentist But now what they do is make you see a tech first So now your talented and wonderful hygienist only comes in for the last 5 minutes and cleans up their work My experience was the tech was no where near as gentle and calming I HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT I make an appointment and drive 20 miles to see the HYGIENIST not a tech I am so very very heart broken I am currently looking for a new dentist I am going to miss them so very much but if I only get to see the hygienist for 5 minutes it is not worth it I am back to being scared to go to my appointments and stress over them for days I just wish they would go back to how it was.
It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyoneYes this may be a bit of a rant so in an attempt to be balanced let me offer a little perspectivePizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year The food is very good The service is good but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar and I have done so on many occasions The wine selection is above average and the environment is pleasantHowever the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees) and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzasAs a fan of excellent food I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptableWhile I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not irreplaceable I might add) after many months of consistent patronage I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.
For the past 5 years we have been going there every single Friday but NO MORE We were mistreated and yelled at by THE OWNER She was stressed and overwhelmed  with COSTUMERS instead of happy to have business She couldn't keep track of the amount of ice cream cone she had served and decided it was better to scream at her clients for her mistakes and negligence All this misbehaving on her part was done in front of children and new trainees NICE We will GLADLY take our business somewhere else where they do appreciate loyal customers and decent families.
Average at best Nothing that chuckie cheese can't do for half the price.
This is the absolute worst service I have ever had I had dial up that was more reliable I have spent more time trying to get a connection than actually using it and it keeps dropping the connection I had wireless with a phone company on the same computer that was faster and flawless They came out and relocated the router that lasted about a day and same sH*t the next morning I am switching to ANYTHING but COX and never again Run run run away and get anything but Cox.
we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores and will stop losing long time customers like us  I always finished up with their chili but now it's an additional $349 and no more hot chocolate chip cookies BTW no more coupons either so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal.
2nd time I've used this location to cater our monthy Directors' Meeting  The first time they said they'd deliver (because they're only a block away) and the food did not show up at the agreed-upon time  They called me an hour later asking me why I hadn't come to the restaurant to pick up the food  I told them that the Manager had specifically agreed (to my face) to deliver--again because we're only a block away  45 minutes AFTER THAT the food showed up  Yesterday I placed my order for this month's meeting today and told them that I'd pick up the food at 12:30  Arrived at 12:30 and they hadn't even started the order  The cashier asks the cook what is going on and (big mistake shithead) he decides to angrily yell his response in Spanish across the kitchen in front of the "Stupid Gringo" that he hasn't started it yet because it isn't due until 12:30  He seemed quite shocked when the Stupid Gringo (who speaks fluent Spanish) answered him IN SPANISH in a less-than-pleasant fashion that it WAS 12:30 PM  Still did not have my food 10 minutes later  The Manager/Shift Supervisor decides to tell me in English that they're having a problem  I respond in Spanish confused as to which language he and his staff should be using in front of customers (particularly because this idiot cook obviously understood English perfectly) asking why he can't deliver my food on time when I specifically confirmed this order well over 24 hours in advance  No comp no price reduction nothing  Will NEVER be eating here AGAIN  I agree with the other reviews regarding service--and while you're at it probably should lose the angry vibe that permeates the kitchen  Particularly when you just never know who can speak Spanish  And it's absolutely unprofessional and insulting to purposely speak another language in front of your customers when you actually do have a command of English.
Buyer Beware Do NOT buy from their bankruptcy liquidation sale - they are bringing in merchandise that R&S never carried to augment the sale We're talking wood veneers and fillers - we were scammed on our dining room set and are out several thousand dollars (the salesperson told us it was solid wood) You go there *thinking* you'll get a high end piece of furniture but they're using the R&S name to sell lesser quality items*Update* After contacting the company handling the liquidation and even getting an e-mail from the former owner of R&S we were refunded our full purchase price   I'm sticking with the original rating only because people visiting the bankruptcy sale need to know they're not getting the same quality they would expect from the R&S name.
I went to one of the temporary ones to get our 2010 and 2011 taxes done (had issues using Turbo Tax to file last year)  So after being quoted "around $200" to do each return I decided OK let's try  My husband usually does it himself with Turbo Tax but since it had issues with the first-time homebuyer credit last year and kept returning the forms we decided to try a live person and we figured $400 wouldn't be too bad  Well after spending hours there because the guy was so slow typing everything in- he kept making mistakes that my husband and I corrected- we ended up with a $579 bill  Not sure how it happened- he said because we itemized etc  I don't know why we weren't quoted at a higher rate  I left there feeling upset cheated and like a fool  He tried to give us a $25 coupon like that would really make a difference  He seemed to understand that it was a lot of money he said it should be free since I'm a teacherblah blah who cares I still had to pay almost $600 right there that I was not expecting to pay We will NEVER use a tax service again  I don't care how desperate I am to get my taxes done  I will trust my husband to do Turbo Tax or whatever and if we miss out on something fine  At last I know I didn't pay some guy more than $100 an hour to type numbers into a computer  What a waste.
Poor customer service - A friend in Scottsdale recommended The Carwasher - he said they hand wash his car and do a good job  When I pulled in and asked to have my car hand washed they told me "oh we only do that for certain customers"  Talk about poor customer service  How about "I'm sorry we don't offer hand washing"  Won't be back.
Given the option of being punched in the face and waiting in line at the Post Office I'd probably wait in line at the post officebut this particular location would make me give it a second thought  Inconveniently located slow as hell and ALWAYS full of people sending 20+ small packages to some random place overseas.
High on their horse Its "our policy" to not allow you to have shots of espresso over ice You HAVE to have an americano   Are you kidding me The other person in my flight crew ended up just getting a few shots of espresso and it was a big ordeal and tasted horrible  "good luck" was the reply when I mentioned going somewhere else As a flight crew member we come through this airport ALL the time Good way for word to travel fast about you is to give flight crew crummy service We both received attitude All we wanted was a simple order bummer was excited about the "something different" factor.
Our pizza was totally raw  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible  I would give 0 stars if I could.
Whenever I get my food- it's cold I don't know why I ever go there I keep hoping it'll turn around- like the others This is expressly a Frosties Only location for me.
I cancelled due to the problems with the facility I mentioned earlier Hell I think almost everyone has had the same problems with this placeThey give you two ways of canceling: Via US mail (they print out a form you provide the envelope and stamp) or in-person during the 9-6 business day Monday-Friday when one of the managers is on duty Why I couldn't cancel online in real time or in person during the weekend No one knew At least they were cheerful about itIn the end nothing much had changed despite complaints from me and I am sure many other members The locker room  and shower area is still dirty the floor is still filled with a lot of rickety treadmills and it's still probably worth the $30/mo for the determined but not if you don't feel like going.
The evening started out nice but quickly turned bad when my boyfriend's food never showed up On  top of that the server was not attentive However they did take off my meal as well as his from the bill to compensate My food was really goodtoo bad the overall experience ruined the evening.
This pizza is HORRIBLE  I just moved to AZ from Chicago and am a pizza fanatic Definitely need some Giordano's pizza in AZI don' t think i could take this lol Maybe it is bc i am used to good pizza living in Chicago but people told me i had to try this pizza when visiting arizona What a mistake  I waited an hour for a table of 5 We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer That was by far the worst i've ever had It wasn't even real calamari The oil they used was garbage And then we ordered a thin pizza and a stuffed pizza Again i have never had worse of either style pizza  I went home and threw a Tombstone frozen pizza in the oven I was really excited to eat this Oregano's pizza and it was very disappointing Maybe i had too high of expectations And maybe i am used to eating good pizza like Giordano's.
Dislike.
My husband has a beef with this restaurant I suggested we go but he reminded me that the last time 2 times we were there the food was not very good a warm iceberg lettuce salad cool pizza And he swears the server took some of our left over pizza instead of boxing it.
Please people wise-up  These Sandwiches are awful  Cheap Italian cold cuts on a big hotdog roll do not make a Sub sandwich  First the meats are pre-sliced and of very poor quality The vegatables have been in the bin too long with brown bits in the lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced while George W was still prez  And people that is a hotdog roll not a sub roll  No structure no body  Look at the pretty signs over the counter now look at the sandwich that you are about to eat  Do they look the same  Well you got what you paid for and you didn't pay much  I swear some people eat for the fuel not for the taste or quality of what they shove down thier cakehole.
What is it with AZ and their TERRIBLE chinese  I'm from small town midwest and our chinese was amazing  This is a big city- wtf  Anyways Oriental Garden "super" buffet was anything but super  I know that buffets in general are hard to rate becuase of the lacking food quality but I've had some great chinese buffets in my day  The options are limited and they didn't even have the favorites like sesame chicken general tso or beef and broccoli  Instead they replaced it with weird questionable entrees like cheese covered seafood mystery  Even the crab legs were bad and had a funky taste  I wouldn't pay $5 for this buffet so the $13 a person is unresonable for the quality of food  I'm sorry I can't think of any prosWill someone please tell where I can find good chinese food in this city.
Ordered 2 pizzas The good news had a groupon The bad news the pizza Both pizzas needed a spatula to pick up a slice without it slopping all over the place All the ingredients on the pizza plate before you can eat it The weakest thin pizza I've ever had If they offered a free pizza I would decline it.
We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week  The service at dinner time is bad bad bad  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress  We try to go back once or twice a year hoping it gets better  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years  And that is probably only a MAYBE.
Said an hour for delivery called after an hour and ten minutes and they told me the driver had left a few minutes before I called  Total time an hour and forty and when we got the pizza the driver had driven so crazy all the toppings slid to one side.
What a come down I've been to the Daily Dose quite a few times and have always had a pretty good experience but not this last time Food was a mixed bag Our favorite Chorizo Mac and Cheese was great and the pretzels were good although we had to send them back because they did not come as requested with butter and salt My son's turkey burger was tasteless and dry I ordered one chorizo taco usually a fave which came cold Not just room temperature cold but cold like just out of the fridge cold The waitress was incredibly rude We made several requests for plates so that we could share the food which had already been served without success Finally I asked the waitress for plates and she replied "The bus boy does that" and walked away I complained to the manager who did respond very well pleasant and offering to comp the mac and cheese but the waitress spent the rest of the evening giving us dirty looks and avoiding our table What happened to professionalism It was my son's last meal in the US before leaving for overseas and he had been so looking forward to it What a disappointment.
I've given this place numerous chances but I just don't think I'll be coming backThough you can find some gems scattered throughout the store the cleanliness and selection of items are probably the poorest of the asian markets in the city Depending on what you're looking for there is either a huge selection or extremely slim During today's visit I noticed black mold below the packaged sausage in the refrigerator There was a dead frog just chilling with a bunch of other alive frogs smushed up against the glass I've never been to an asian market where the people serving you wear rubber cleaning gloves while handling your money and groceriesThere are definitely cleaner asian markets with better selections.
Oddly enough it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp) But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog but that was the last straw for me I will miss the Sourdough Burger but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese).
I hate to break it to you all but the long awaiting delivery of an H&M store in Scottsdale turned out to be a huge disappointment Ever hear the saying "Good from far but far from good"  This pretty much sums it up The clothes are great for a straight figured person with no curves that only wants to wear their cloths once or twice Otherwise you are SOL  There is no quality control whatsoever except that they are all made cheaply  The only thing good I can say about H&M is the have cute accessories.
Please read previous posts for the complete storyI have currently handed out over 500 flyers and spoke with 43 people over the weekend 97 total people about never using this company If these guys new anything about business they would know it takes 4-7 positive experiences to get 1 new customer and 2-3 negative to prevent 5-7 new customers from ever trying the companyKeep up that poor customer services quike & cleanThis time next year Scottsdale Az might have a new place to shop in place of the fraud wash.
What a complete and total dump  Really if you can't keep driving then get arrested or something  Whatever you do don't stay in this nasty place  I will never make the mistake of staying in a Knight's Inn again and in fact will question any Wyndham property  The place is completely worn out  No bucks spent in upkeep  The phones don't work the lights don't work  I don't think it was a safe environment  We were remote and exhausted or I would have kept going  Whatever you do don't stay in a Knight's Inn.
Pretty annoyed with this place  Only reason I am ok with giving them any stars is they had Kiltlifter on tap otherwise i would strongly campaign for a zero star review  I got the "Miss Priss" it tasted like sour garbage Mushy warm sour garbage How do you mess up a turkey sandwich  YUCK  My friend got the "Hawaii chicken" he quickly named to vomity badness the chicken breast was brown not dark meat BROWN I was going to take my leftover 3/4 of a sandwich and give it to a homeless person or something but i didn't want to make they're day any worse So long story short if you wanna go spend 13501700 with tip spend that money somewhere else because mill is popping off with waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better places than this chronic tacos next door looks interesting and the munchies deli as well.
Steak "special" was 80% fat and lacked flavor mussels undercooked pasta overcooked garlic mashed potatoes that set your mouth on fire subpar service Save your money.
Bummer Was so looking forward to have great wings with my girls Hair in water (tap water)glass dried food on platefood on the floor under the table order was wrong and wings where gross Never coming back.
*** This Review was for the previous owner the New Owner is great and I have really enjoyed shopping at this location ***This rating is for the new store currently sharing a location with Imperial Outpost Games (which by the way is a very good wargame store) - 7/29/11No matter what the store is like what events they run or who plays games there The owner is a world class jerk  He is curt unfriendly disingenuous and all together distasteful to meI have never been treated so rudely by anyone connected to retail  I guess being right across from a college lets you get away with treating customers poorly since more will come in from the schoolI visit many of the CCG stores in the valley and this is the only one I will never buy a single thing from  If you want to experience one of the nicest guys around go to Rookies to Legends  "VP" (the manager) is one of the nicest guys around.
This is the second time we have been to this denny's the first same thing happened Burnt bacon sausage and ham This time it was worse burnt bacon sausage ham uncooked pancakes and watered down ice tea Love denny's but never going to this one ever again Got pictures of the food if i can post it here i will.
Walked in at 8 on a Friday night  The place was half empty open tables in full view and we were told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes We must have appeared baffled as we looked around at the abundance of available seating and were told they were "re-setting"  That must be industry lingo for "we have no intention of waiting on you" It smelled good & we were in the mood for Italian so we went into the bar (two couples at tables but otherwise empty)  We sat down and anticipated a friendly bartender but instead watched four different employees come behind the bar and without even a glance in our direction turn right around & walk back out I will never try this place again and will be sure to tell everyone I know I signed up for Yelp just to share this ridiculous experience.
I went in to do some enlarging at 3AM as the FedEx Office is 24 hrs There were 3 individuals sleeping at the computers and 1 sleeping next to the register 1 had an IV drug needle on the desk by the computers I spoke with the FedEx employee who indicated she knew the person and he was diabetic Now I am sympathetic to both the homeless and handicap but 1) I dont care if he is diabetic and 2) I dont need to see a needle used or otherwise on the desk AND 3) the needle was put in a regular garbage can not a biohazard can like at a hospital This not only puts workers at risk but is pretty scummy too The employee seemed to know that these people were sleeping in her store but didnt seem to care when I mentioned it Basically if this is what FedEx Office wants to be known as a homeless shelter than fine But I never associated FedEx with this kind of situation and I am very hesitant to go back or recommend this location to anyone I could handle the sleeping but the IV needle on the desk was too much.
UGGGGH It is red Lobster what do you expect Red Lobster is the Denny's of seafood It is garbage with a ton of salt on it It is not going to change No matter who thinks it is "Good" it isn't.
This place sucks I called on my way to this store to buy a new iPhone 5s for my son and they said they had one left Within 5-10 minutes I was there After waiting for help the girl says we don't have any Total waste of my time.
I originally posted a negative review on this restaurant back in November and the manager immediately contacted me and said steps were being taken to improve the sanitation issues I had mentioned  Changes were noticed and I have been a regular customer since although a visit on Saturday (Apr 28th) will change that again  As I was eating I witnessed an employee wiping tables with a rag  Someone behind the counter yelled at him to clean up a mess on the floor so he bent down and wiped up the floor with the same rag  Then he proceeded to wipe off all the used trays with that same rag and put them back into circulation to be used by the next customers  I got up to leave and said something to the girl behind the counter about it and she just ignored me   So I will be ignoring this restaurant from now on.
Pre-purchased a wax for $89 with paperwork indicating full wax job clay and etc   I came back a month later to have car waxed sales or detailing manager told me that I only bought to only have left side of door waxed and tried to sell me another wax which I already bought and clearly indicated on paperwork Finally they realized i was aware of scheme and said would wax the entire car   However to find out an hour later  my car was not waxed but just sprayed with a liquid shine on certain area of car    Because my car was new and expensive I didn't want to argue to have it done right and risk them harming my paint  The next day I waxed the car myself which you can clearly teell the difference of car that has been waxed   Don't pre-purchase services from this place and do not use them as they are dishonest.
Extremely disappointing service and inconsistent quality compared to other locations  I ordered several meals online including one gluten free and arrived at the time it was supposed to be ready I was told three of my meals were ready but that they wait for the person picking up a GF order to arrive before preparing it Then I was told that  they are working on it "now" Even though their excuse made no sense I believed it wouldn't be long since it wasn't a complicated order and tried to be understanding I waited Then was told "Sorry for the wait  Have a free drink while you wait" I didn't want the drink Then I was told again that they were working on it "now" and offered a free drink A supervisor type complimented the crew saying "good job for getting through all those orders with only a GF order" left to do as if keeping a GF order waiting is preferred And the food quality was inconsistent with other locations.
Unreal  I just spent $8 or $9 for 5 pigs in a blanket  Seriously  Not even a whole hotdog  What a rip  I asked the waitress for a recommendation   Clearly a ton of profit for them  Check the picture.
Ok I'm so sorry to have to give such an update review  I've been to Sala Thai several times since discovering it a couple of years ago  I decided to take my really good friends for lunch a couple of weeks ago When we walked it we sat on the newly expanded side  They had recently doubled in dining space The food of just okay this time  I'm not sure if the cook of having an off day or what  Well while we were eating and chit-chatting away my friend started to get all excited from across the booth telling me to get up and look behind me  When I did I saw a roach crawling on my seat then scurry away to the next booth  Okay I tried not to freak out myself and continued our lunch Then my 7 year old starts to freak out next to me as he notices 2 roaches on the wall next to my friend across the table  Okay that was it  My son and friend got up and stood there until our bill came  Our waitress came out and saw what the excitement was all about but do you think she said anythingof course not  I assume this must be a normal thing for them now  Well needless to say I don't think I'll be returning to Sala Thai.
It was a lunch time and I was starving Z'tejas seemed to be the only quick option around so we parked our car and got a table The overall design of the place was not bad The service was not bad (fake) Now the food The food was bad-from the presentation to the consumption part was just bad I had the Pork "tender"loinThe meat looked like it had been sitting in the Atlantic for a few years The onions rings were the best thing in the plate and I use the word "best" very looselyMy mother had the mahi She compared it to "A dried out version of what could've been" Z'tejas need to stop trying to do 20 things and focus on one type of food                             -Heisenberg.
I'm not a Starbucks regular but I was with friends who wanted to go here for breakfast To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks and this was no exception To me Starbucks is always crowded noisy and has slow and rude service Overall too stressful for me if I want coffee I want a relaxing experienceOn this trip I ordered a breakfast sandwich whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out The only other item I got was from the cold case so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself But yeah apparently ordering one item is too difficult and they will screw it up.
The parking officers are snakes If you are picking up a family member and you stop for more than 20 seconds they sneak up on your car and start writing you a ticket without signaling or saying anything They don't care if your family member is disabled they will still write you a ticket BEWARE If you see a short heavy cross-eyed female parking officer with a screw face and dirty cloths immediately drive off If you drive away before she puts the ticket on your car you are good to go This is definitely not the friendliest airport in the country like they try to say it is And the pick-up/ drop-off platform is a huge revenue generator for the city of Phoenix so don't try to fight a ticket It is a waste of time The Judge will simply side with the revenue generator (the parking officer) The parking officer will lie in court and say that they signaled to you even though she actually snuck up on you The matter becomes even more confusing because there are huge areas with no "No Parking" signs posted BEWARE they will still write you a ticket in any area they feel like so if you see any parking officer in this airport anywhere near your car especially the fat  cross-eyed dirty screw-faced one drive off Don't even ask a question just drive.
I am a fan of the 500 club and often visit this course as a break in scenery from my home MVCC course  Today however was by far the most unpleasant experience I have had at the 500 club  I do not often play late twilight hours but today I was invited by three colleagues to play your course so I obliged  We arrived and checked in at 6 pm  We purchased our round ($28) and proceeded to play or try to play nine holes  For the most part the round was enjoyable despite not having any beverage or drink service in triple-digit temperatures but that was not a concern for us  What concerned me and why I am writing today is because of the rude manner in which we were treated trying to rush our round with approximately 15 hours of sunlight remaining  They wanted to close up shop early and did not inform us of that fact  After a certain time only teenagers run the golf course and do not understand long-term market share or basic customer service principles which pay their hourly wageNevertheless we were rudely escorted off to the club house and not even allowed to drop our bags off at the bag drop area  I've heard of some pretty bad golf experiences with post-round play but this one takes the cake  Absolutely unacceptable to be mistreated in this manner  We would not have mind if we were politely asked to finished or if we would rush our play to finish by 7:30 pm but instead we were forced and guided back to the club house like a bunch of kids (all four of us are successful executives working with fortune 500 companies in Arizona)  More so this would have been acceptable had we known to return the carts by 7:30 pm  Why would the pro shop employees sell us a round at 6 pm without informing us that the carts had to be returned at 7:30 pm  To communicate the time expectation with two holes remaining in the round is absurd  That important factorial is beyond me but not the root cause of our complaint with this customer service -- it was the manner in which we were treated after receiving this new information and forced off of the course Sadly I have been playing here for quite some time but after my experience this afternoon I will find it hard to return when there are much better courses in Arizona who will not only provide exceptional greens but an exceptional experience in-and-out of the pro shop.
Slow and had to go get the manager to expedite our order that was sitting in the window "to go" even they gave me a table number sign Lost is all can say I guess blame it on the rain.
HORRIBLE    I ordered Chicken Fried Rice General Tso's Chicken Orange Beef and egg rolls  Very poor cuts of meat Terrible Flavor Cabbage in egg rolls smelled and tasted rotten I highly recommend going anywhere elseDO NOT EAT THERE.
When I called to ask the hours the owner snapped and said "Who is this" When I showed up she made us sit in the parking lot in July while she locked up her dog Then proceeded to tell us that she was gonna kick us out after I told her I was just browsing Then she told me I would be the last customer ever because she's closing down to turn it into a B-movie screening theater due to people like me who just browse and waste her time According to another review she said the same thing to someone else over a year ago My boyfriend asked if her new business would be friendlier (lol) and she said "No in fact worse" Horrible customer service horribly disorganize no wares of interest smelled like dog and mothballs and the owner is rude & insane.
I have been in Rod Works twice and each time I was disappointed  The decor that Rod Works offers is just Ross finds remarked and overpriced  The staff needs some serious lessons in customer service  I was never greeted asked if I was looking for something in particular or thanked for my purchase (don't worry I wont be purchasing anything from there again)  On my last visit I asked if I may set a breakable item at the counter that I wished to purchase so that I could continue to shop and was regarded in a snotty tone by a woman standing behind the counter that she "didnt work there"  I get the impression that this store is just a hobby for some spoiled housewife who's husband has a real job and instead of taking care of her home and children she sits behind the counter of her store gossiping and ignoring customers  If I want to be treated poorly and be ignored Ill just shop at Walmart  More than likely I will find the same items for sale at a fraction of the cost.
We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot) See this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently "out of meat" Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities To make matters worse when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available So we planned our whole afternoon around this and wasted time until 4 When we arrived for our second attempt of the day to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier Now tickets were on sale for five bucks but there was no BBQ No BBQ at a BBQ Fest ex-fucking-scuse me Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants it just didn't make much senseSo many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event it has promise Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food and not the ill planned event itself Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning Avoid this place at all costs If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experienceOf course you start with complimentary chips and salsa Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt Both salsas one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt garlic and heat essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measureWe ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($600) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($1595) which is a sampling of all their house specials Pollo Fundido mini chimi's flauta's tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans Sounds promising and a no brainerAs soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite of the old variety While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's No amount of salsa could save this one it was doaThen the sampler arrived if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived The plate of beige had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla everything was just above room temperature Let me tell you there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate Just a sampler of dried out deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green bland version of guacamoleAfter a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door When I asked our server for a to go menu she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review The owner's should be ashamed of themselves In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly.
Terrible Should have taken nobody in there as a sign I would say this place ranks below Panda Express Food tasted FUNKY I will not be back.
Went to get gel nails the other day They did a very sloppy job  Nails lifted after the first day and white tips were very uneven Will never go back.
I confirmed with restaurantcom that the voucher was valid and that the owner acted in an inappropriate manner  AVOID PITA HOUSE.
Horrible horrible horrible 4 or 5 times they have forgotten parts of order while using drive thru  This has not only happened to me but to my son and granddaughter   Was promised $5 coupon this last visit when arrived at store to pick up remainder of order told we don't have coupons we put you name in a book  How professional is that  I ask for a corporate number and no one could provide one  This just can't be true that a store don't have a list of phone numbers  Out of hot sauce too  What kind of operation is this  Very disappointed  They have lost my whole family's business.
This spa was so hard to find There is no good signage on the property to get you there In hindsight that may have been a good thing The place is pretty much a dump Very outdated and I swear it smelled I have no idea why this hotel is known to be so upscale As far as the spa goes I was seriously disappointed and would never go back There are so many beautiful spas in Scottsdaleavoid this one Yuck.
Stumbled upon this place around dinner time and decided to give it a try Bad decisionI will first give you the worst My fiance had explosive diarrhea all night after eating here He ordered Ichi RollI wish I had read the review on this restaurant then I would have avoided this place The other reviewer has described this Ichi Roll I completely agree Gross In addition to what he described this roll is huge the size of a burger patti No roll should be so big that you can't fit in your mouth That just goes to show the chef does not know Japanese cuisineI ordered dragon roll which is eel and avocado Overall flavor is okay but the texture of the fish is mushier than usual that it makes me think perhaps it's not freshThe green tea Watered down Not much flavorEdamame Tasted like store bought Edamame but it's the kind that's overstocked and about to expire You get the IdeaSo will I come back to this restaurant You tell me.
Used to come here almost everyday Now a bunch of dirty teens work at night laughing and pushing eachother around in the back Fries were soggy and cold and were covered in sticky red stuff This stucky red stuff also on my drink I was so discussed I wanted to puke Threw it all out and will NEVER be coming back You could not pay me to eat here again.
Okay so I'm not really a huge McDonald's fan but I come here a lot when I bring girls for mentoring So as we are sitting and doing work out of a book on a Sunday night (paying customers) the girl that I'm mentoring is smoking her electronic cigarette (no scent and nothing harmful even airports allow them) the manager literally YELLS across the restaurant "YOU CAN'T DO THAT" and is completely rude and unprofessional I understand rules and don't mind abiding by them but to be rude and brash Unnecessary Not to mention my burger was cold and there was no ketchup in the containers The restaurant was practically empty and there was no line I worked in the restaurant industry for years I was absolutely disgusted We won't be coming here to do work anymore What a jerk.
Went to blue agave last night for taco Tuesday My girlfriend and I got food poisoning and still have symptoms 24 hours later Beware of dollar tacos because taco Tuesday will lead to vomit vednesday Sever was nice though so I will give it a star I pretty much don't want to ever eat Mexican food ever again for the rest of my life.
Not great at all  If I could give this place a zero I would  I ordered one thing and was given another and not even asked if they could replace with what I ordered when I took it back  The chips are not even chips they are like cinnamon pita chips  I would not recommend this place at all.
DO NOT EAT HEREThe food here is the worst Chinese food we have ever tasted My girlfriend and I took one bite of our dinner and left Garbage junk and complete trash The reviewer who said he would "Stick his wiener in a meat grinder" was not exaggerating We should have heeded his warning.
awful food is bad and there is nogood service.
My kids love this place and I keep getting suckered back in but never again  Ants on the table was a bit much-and the lack of apology or offer to discount or meal sealed it for me  This place is banned from my list forever.
The girls that work there are too busy to chatting to say hi unlock fitting rooms or ring up customers I wanted to try on some shorts they didn't even look at me I didn't want to interrupt their very important conversation so I just took my business elsewhere.
I'm not sure if the delivery issues are with Pink Pepper or Grubhubit was if no one who got the order read it Veggie Curry had little veggies in it My duck dish simply wasn't From now on we'll just drive to "Mint Thai" in the future.
I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired  First off the oil leak was "repaired" only to find out later that it really wasn't  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket which either occurred when this shop put the part in or they purchased it with the defect but either way the problem was missed on their part which tells me they do not pay attention to detail  So when we noticed the leak was still an issue it was under warranty through this shop for the original work so I took it back  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley they did repair it however later that day my "service engine" light came on then went off  A few days later I parked my car turned it off and went to start it again after picking up my mail and the car would not start  Thankfully my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty) we towed my vehicle back to my house which was only down the road but it was dead  Come to find out the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way which is what tripped my "service engine" light a couple of days before and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle the vehicle finally wouldn't start  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak) and there have been zero issues sinceNow I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well  But given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished I am not very happy  On top of it I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance) and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son and I were both sick at the timeI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone I will never ever go back and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot  What a complete and utter nightmare.
This place leads the list of tourist traps in Old Town Scottsdale  It has all the massed produced junk you'd expect to find at an airport store - t-shirts postcards cactus - with nothing interesting or unique  Save your time and money  It's better spent elsewhere in Scottsdale.
Unfortunately my experience was much similar to Mark's The staff was indeed friendly but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs My therapist Melissa was nice but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action Instead I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of GoogleMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments I would arrive and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting motionless waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me This is "treatment" - time that I was billed for This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone either At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around off-leash for her entire session I'm a dog lover as much as the next person but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species much less a dogUltimately I received no relief no specialized attention and no care I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic In addition as Mark said be sure to read the "Welcome" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met Under my plan previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible but my benefits had recently changed I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570 That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them I will add that after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair As stated before the entire staff is courteous and patient but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere.
Stopped in for a company department lunch big mistake terrible food and terrible serviceThe bartender was our server but bless his heart he tried we waited close to 30 minutes for our food which isn't ideal for when you're on company time I ordered a lunch special salad and with what ended up being breaded boneless deep fried chicken strips however from the menu pic it looked like they were grilled chicken strips  It wasn't so I was very disappointed but i tried to eat it and it was as bad as I knew it would beDon't go to NNY every experience i've had there has been terrible.
This more so goes for ALL corporate movie theatersDo the major film companies still question why people download movies How about the $7 minimum to get in Way overpriced extreme unhealthy food choices Or sitting through 20-30 mins of ADS $30-40 just to be marketed at Sad days for the movie theater business.
(  o  ) (  o  )    Boobies = cool   Hooters = stupid crappy place   Food sucks Chicks are stupid Having some cleavage showing does not give them a free pass when it comes to poor service   I didn't pick this place a buddy of mine did  That bastard I might not talk to him anymore  I never understood the pantyhose with the shorts what no talent ass clown in upper management came up with that brilliant marketing ploy.
Do not visit this location I ordered a sandwich to go and when I arrive home and take the sandwich out of the bag it looks floppy and wet I open the wrapper and the whole sandwich is completely soggy and falling apart and the tomatoes were squishy and old I could not even eat half of it because it was just like mush bread and slimy meat Never going there again.
Really funky nasty and trashy neighborhood this place was in The clerk behind the booth was behind metal bars as well I know this is KIND of standard these days but it fit quite well for the neighborhood To make it all the more worse I am 100% sure that I got scabies(skin lice) off of the sheets This was the only hotel I stayed at the time Normally considered a STD That was a horrible experience My dogs got it too and had to go to the vet and it took me weeks to get over it and I had to cover myself from the top of my head to the soles of my feet and itch even more because that was a sign that the medicine was working  I had to wash my wardrobe three times to make sure the bugs were dead and constantly had to clean the house and try not to touch a thing while I was getting over it UghNot all Motel 6's are like this but in Phoenix they might be.
Oh  The Jade BarYears ago I was a regular here  I spent many hours sitting at the bar or out on the patio  I grew up in Paradise Valley  Most of my friends still live there or near to there  I found the Jade Bar in 2002 or 2003 and it quickly became my meeting place for friends out of town guests and business associates  Back then we would go there with out a moments notice  The bar was always fully stocked with great Vodkas Great wines and one hell of a beer selection  The bartenders knew how to take care of you  They were quick to make you a drink and had a meaningful conversation while they did itThen it all changed  One day we came in as a group of 8  It was humiliating to say the least  My friends and business associates waited 10  20 minutes for a drink  One of my friends ordered one of their most popular drinks and it came out the wrong color  It wasn't even the right drink - Since that experience we rarely go back A good friend of mine lives at the base of the mountain he frequents the Jade Bar regularly  But even he will admit "it is only because its the best choice for a nearby drink"  I have gone there with him on a few occasions and I am disgusted by the attitude you receive by the staff  I am disgraced by the lack of concern for their customers  It literally took them at least 10 minutes to get me a beer Honestly I do not know what happened  And it makes me mad  Because I loved that barSo fast forward to end of 2012I struggled with the idea of even going back there But my girl friend insisted that we go  I have to admit that I had a preconceived notion of how it would go  Well I was right  We showed up and found a table sat down and waited  We waited long enough for me to ask my GF twice to leave  The waitress showed up and was quick to ask us what we wanted but then was just as quick to walk away when we didn't know  I eventually got drinks from the bar  Wow  What a mess  One bartender wouldn't even look at me he was knee deep in bottles and other crap  I got a drink for my GF and I had a beer  This cost me about $23  They push this idea that they are so great with their MIXOLOGY but honestly they look like fools  I work from time to time in San Fransisco and I have seen real MIXOLOGY bars  This is not one of themBig deal $23  Not really considering the lack of attention lack of concern and lack of customer service  Back in 2003 I would of had $100 dollar tabs and not cared  I would spend the money and Tip big  I have never written a Yelp Review  As a matter of fact most places I just don't care enough  But this place went from best bar to the worst barMy friend just told me they are renovating the bar to make it bigger  This humors me because the last few times I have been there it was pretty apparent their clientele is slowing down  It used to be packed now it is pretty vacant because they can not make drinks fast enough  So I guess my final thought is this you can have the best location in the world and the best looking bar but a structure is just a structure without good people you are nothing but an illusion.
This is my worst experience at a Sonic The location is hard to reach the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru there is no drive-thru window I felt like I could have gone to Applebees ordered ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers.
If you need a lawyer do not consider Mike Troncellito (MT)   After saying hello and shaking hands we sat down in his office where I started to explain the reason why I needed a lawyer Ladies pay attention:  MT haughtily and sarcastically said "H-E-L-L-O" (for the second time) and then told me I was AGGRESSIVE  What theMemo to the arrogant and self-important:  it's not in your best interest to insult people you don't know because we can be vengeful spiteful and downright INSANEAnd one more thingwe get even  In fact we get better than even:  we leave our calling card on every website possible and let the entire world know what we think of you  Little people like me that people like you - people who consider themselves superior because they have a law degree - think you can talk down to have a forum a very wide-ranging forumMT knew within 30 seconds that he didn't want my case however rather than tell me that outright I had to sit through 25 minutes of "joe six-pack carrie cleaning lady and other blue collar types won't be sympathetic to you"   MT LOVES to hear himself talk  Ladies beware - he is extremely condescending  MT was the guy in high school (because like it or not everyone can be traced back to those four wonderful treasured years we spent in high school) that nobody looked at twice  He looks less like a law school grad and more like a fast food worker  He looks out of place in his office which resembles the inside of a model home  Our meeting consisted of MT highlighting the bad points of my case  Whatever I said positive he turned into a negativeAfter he finally said he wouldn't take my case I made the mistake of asking him to recommend another attorney  MT's  responsed to my request was a question (I'm paraphrasing here because I don't' recall the exact words he used):  "Have you ever smelled milk in your fridge that's gone bad  I mean really bad so bad that it smells like"  I didn't bother to answer  In other words since my case was so awful and he didn't want it why in the world would anyone elseTaking the milk analogy one step further - cream being the best sour milk the worst - would you rather hire an attorney employed at Fennimore Craig (cream) or MT (sour milk)MT is not Harvard or Yale  which I know to some people is a good thing  He's Rutger's law by way of the University of Scranton (University of Scranton  Really  Is this related to McDonald's Hamburger University)MT handed me his business card  After a few seconds I slipped it back in the card holder on his desk    MT said   "You can't find any use for my card"Absolutely not(Update:  MT emailed me after reading this review shortly after it was published  After reading the first few words I deleted his email and didn't respond  Let him comment in this forum if he dares).
The club itself is ok and deserves 3 stars It's more of a crowded lounge/bar since there isn't a dance floor but it's a chill place w/ good musicIt's the male bartender that really brought the rating down I would give negative stars if I could He charged me $31 for 2 Hennessey shots whereas the female bartenders charged $37 for 3 Hennessey shots For my other friends he charged $16 for a mixed drink whereas the females charged $7-9 for the same thing When the female bartenders were asked why the male was charging so much more they just said "he shouldn't be The prices should be the same no matter who you go to" Apparently not To top it all off I checked my credit card statement today and he decided to add in a nice tip for himself Luckily I was able to easily dispute it w/ my CC company but they are reimbursing me as a courtesy not recouperating the difference from Suede bc they said it'd be cheaper for them since it's a relatively small amount I'll never go back to Suede again and will continue to warn others to do the same.
They have the worst pizza and wings I have ever had in my life I had asked for mild sauce for the wings and they arrived without any sauce The wings were soaked in grease and tasted horrible The pizza dough was very doughy and flavorless I would not recommend anybody order food from this location.
This place used to be way better a few years ago when it was a Dannys Family car wash When Full Circle took over things went downhill It feels like no one takes care of anything and feels a little run down It's worth driving a few miles down the street and go to danny's instead Probably best to avoid this place.
First and last time customer I ordered a vegetariano salad for pickup and when I got it back to work I noticed they had put bacon/pork in it.
Went in on labor day 2011 at around 1:30pm with my fiance Was told the kitchen was backed up TWO HOURS What the hell is up with that Who the hell do they have back there preparing the dishes That is a bunch a crap If they can't handle being busy then they need to get outa the kitchen Will never go back there Very disapointed:(.
service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
Ideal Image lies and writes long contracts to protect themselves  After 2 years I still have hair growing in the treatment area  I still have to shave every week and they will not refund and you can not sue  It cost me 1000's of dollars  After the ninth treatment you have to pay more for more treatments even though the hair should have been gone.
"Lowering Cane's expectations" should be the nameThey have just set the bar low on food quality and taste  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezerMust not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him  Just drove away disappointed  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intakeOnly positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty cleanDon't waste your time.
This Yogurtlicious location is unfortunately closed due to non-payment of rent just like several other food establishments in the  shopping plaza on the corner of 35th Aveand Southern That leaves us the awful Chinese buffet and the surly Subway Oh- and Taco Bell Awesome.
Just came back from that festival I don t want to be bad We are from Europe This is a real joke Between charlemagne ( 8th century) the elephants and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between  You pay 20 dollars for what Park your car maybe in rocksyou must pay everything inside 1 dol to 6 dol at least Just for rides Family of 6 It hurts + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each) Go once and never go back Good luck.
How do you go through life and try to win over new business when the first word is always NO It says bank on the outside but try to get change to break a couple twenties for coinage and was asked if I had an account there You're a BANK  Where is your customer service Great way to run of new business.
This Starbucks is SLIPPINGtwice within 1 week we have left empty handed Stopped in for coffee a couple nights ago and the girl said "we don't have any" I thought she was jokingfinally she said "if you want to wait we can make some" frustrated by the lazy-faire attitude we left Sunday afternoon @ 1:30 we stopped in for a pound of espresso beans (which we buy once a week at this same location) only to be told "we're outwe don't have any" UNBELIEVABLE Are you a coffee store or just a wi fi hot spot Needless to say this is disturbing & what makes it worse is the staff doesn't care in the slightest.
I try to like you Postinos I really do but you make it so hard  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyedThe parking lot disaster strikes again  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spacesOnce seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order  No suggestions on a wine no questions if we had questions just "you ready to order"We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared  For the rest of the night  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables ours was brought by another server  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished ours sat in front of us until another server took them away  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left  No offer of another round of drinks just here is your checkThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta  The bruschetta themselves were half assed  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decentYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here.
Update: The representative who contacted me a week ago called me today after two emails and a phone call asking for a resolution The bottom line is that literally nothing has changed - they are sticking with the "offer" of reducing our contract to one year instead of three I reminded him that he agreed with me that it was a very shady situation and that we had been "hooked in" (his own words) and then asked how it was worth it for ADT as a business to continue to try and get $300 out of us rather than stand behind their word and protect their reputation Apparently it isn't So all the reviews will stay all the reviews on Yelp Facebook Twitter etc and I will continue to add them A huge thank you to those who have offered their support and those who are spreading the word ADT is not an honest company and have made it abundantly clear that they do not care about their customers I have not been surprised to find many more scathing reviews as I have added mine to the bunch ADT I suppose I should thank you for showing your true form and making it easy to warn people away from your business I hope it was worth it Enjoy your $300.
Horrible stay Decided to stay here after surgery to recover and relax Awful beds I slept worse here than in the hospital Upgraded to a nicer room upon check in but I reaped zero benefits from that Called the front desk multiple times to get reg coffee for the coffee maker and they told me that I needed to go to the restaurant if I wanted that They never replaced the toilet paper in the room so i resorted to using kleenex The hotel claims to be a 4 star establishment but in actuality it is just a spoofed up motel I will never stay here again and I am beyond disappointed by this establishment and the staff.
The first time we went to the fair *cough* glorified carnival *cough* was three years ago  I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone  We went for one of the free concerts but left early due to the amount of marijuana smoke in the section of the coliseum we were in me being pregnant at the time  We swore off the state fair and had not returned  Sadly we promised our toddler a ride on the ferris wheel when the state fair came this year  We figured we'd go fairly early and leave before dark Some of the workers look like they are on a prison work-release programwe won't even discuss the general crowd that attends   The food to us was subpar: "Super" nachos for $7 that consisted of the kind of chips you can buy in the store covered with cheese and hamburger meat everything else including sour cream peppers tomatoes etc were at least a buck extra All of the restrooms we used had no soap at all  Interestingly we went on opening day and the blocks and mats in Toddler Town were filthy  The fair had only been open for 4 hrs so I know the dirt was not from just that little time  Lame animal exhibits a "farm tour" that has just a few animals but dozens of rabbits for sale  More profanity from the mouths of kids (some who looked all of 10 years old) everywhere we walked than I hear in a month  On the way out a herd of tweens-teens ran through the crowd chasing after some other kids while screaming profanities  We definitely will NOT be back  We found a fair this summer in CA that was just awesome: clean safe and the best "fair-type" food we have ever had    We'll plan to go there next summer  I'm sad that this fair is supposed to represent the state of Arizona.
I have called Kane and Jason at least two times each today as well as emails to find out how and when they are going to correct the massively out of level garage cabinet install  The price is low but where is the customer support when YOUR team makes a mistake  I will update and edit this review as the problem is either taken care of or ignored.
I heard about Mistique when I bought a living social deal a few months ago I paid $29 for a hot stone pedicure and hand massage valued at $60 I was very excited to try a new place and assumed it was something special considering I never pay $60 for a pedicureMy first impression of the boutique was that it was small modern and I really enjoyed the overall vibe- but where are the pedicure spa chairs There was one small chair and the woman came out from the back carrying a large ceramic bowl filled with hot water I don't know about anyone else but I really like the massage chairs and the jets that are standard at most nail salons It was a disappointment not having thatThe woman who did my pedicure was funny and very friendly but I don't think she does a lot of pedicures The paint looked sloppy and since I hadn't worn my own sandals I left barefootCute decor and friendly tech doesn't mean I want to go back for a VERY overpriced crappy looking pedicure.
No longer in business.
We should have read the Yelp reviews before going to this place but after now 2 bad experiences I feel the need to write a review DO NOT go here The first time we went it was to get  new tubes for my bike We even brought a tube in so we would get the correct size replacements This older man working at the counter was like a Mr-Know-It-All barely looking at the tire and spouting off what size he thought it was Then he goes to the back and gets us the replacement tubes which we bought then brought home Upon putting these tubes on my bike they were the wrong size So back we went to exchange them yet they apparently ran out of thorn resistant tubes for my Schwinn so we bought the regular ones Funny thing is this man told us that they are the only bike shop in PHX to carry thorn resistant tubes for Schwinn yet we weren't sure why they had none in stockA week later the tubes popped and we went back to get replacements again And again this useless man gave the wrong size We are bringing them back now and telling him we are never go back there again There are plenty of other better bike shops in PHX and ScottsdaleI'll just find one with good ratings on Yelp.
We really wanted to find good Pizza in Gold Canyon butthis is not it Don't bother we just made an expensive mistake:-(.
After a long morning of volunteering at a local animal shelter my coworkers and I sat down at the famous (infamous) Los Dos Molinos for a filling lunch  I know 10 people at lunch is a challenge but the place was empty and we were treated like it was a major inconvenience  Service was slow and unfriendly I was never asked if I even wanted a drink I had to make a significant assertion to get one glass of diet coke  I ordered two chicken tacos with no cheese no beans I know it sounds boring but it is what I wanted to have for lunch  I received pork tacos and a plate full of beans  So how was the food I can imagine dog waste tasting better than the taco that I ate  Hell I can make better soft tacos in my home kitchen anytime and run circles around this placeAdditionally my coworker did not get his chili relleno until 15 minutes after everyone else was served and it looked more like soft green chili slop more than anything elseTo top it all off it took ages to get a check and when we did they would not allow us to pay separately   Needless to say I will not be returning to this place  For much better food service and cleanliness check out La Pinata near 16th Ave and Thomas it is awesome.
My wife and I went to Havana Café on our 1st date  Needless to say we love the place and it means something special to us  We have been there many times  The past 3 visits have gone downhill quickly3 visits ago the Paella was mediocre at best  2 visits ago the service was poor  This last trip the service was horrid  The food was good   However we waited 20 minutes for our check  There were 6 of us and they added an automatic 20% gratuity  I understand that is the policy of most places  But when the service is plain and simply bad that is just not ok  To top it off at 6pm on a Saturday evening it wasn't just warm in the restaurant it was flat out HOT  I was sweating for the 2nd half of our dinner and throughout the time we waited to get our check  The service and temperature made for a very bad experience  I am very sad to say that we will not be back to Havana café.
Worst sushi I've ever had I guess you get what you pay for but I thought that since it was the "oldest Japanese restaurant in Phoenix" that it might be good The staff messed up our order and then when we got the missing roll argued about it's quality (poor) I will never go here again.
I'm never shopping here I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it.
I stopped by here to check it out because I loved Postinos  The wait staff is unfriendly and rude They can't make a good martini to save their life  There are much better places to go in that area that are a ton better   If you are thinking of going here move on.
I've never been so disappointed in a veterinary visit  I brought my new puppy to this location to make sure he was healthy before I introduced him to my other dog He seemed to be having an ear issue and I let the veterinarian know All I was told was that his ears were too hairy to be able to tell "but if I signed up for the healthcare plan" they'd be able to do a test to see what was going on They were more concerned about selling me a year plan than my dog Not wanting to commit to a year plan with them they advised me to simply clean my dogs ears Now BOTH my dogs can't stop scratching their ears and I now have to pay for two visit to a different veterinary office and find out what they have going on in their ears I am so disappointed I waisted my money here and even more upset I now have two dogs that are suffering from their inability to fix the problem with my new puppy I will never spend aanother penny in this store and would advise anyone going to their veterinary clinic to choose an different location or completely avoid banner clinics.
My dad ordered a chile relleno and it came out with what looked like chicken inside what the I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way Aunt chilada's does  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky  Salsa was average nothing about this place was "mexican" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company  Aunt Chilada's you FAIL.
These are horrible pharmacy people they would not fill a pain prescription for my dog who has cancer and needs his meds every 72 hours Manager even got involved and still would not fill it even though I have been to other CVS pharmacy's in Tempe near my work Would not call other pharmacy nor my vet to do her "research" Ended up having to drive 60 miles round trip to Tempe to get it filled and spent over 3 hours  My dog suffered horribly that day and night because it takes 8 hours to kick in which I told the pharmacist and almost had to make the decision to put him down Luckily this morning because of the great Tempe location he is feeling better But all could have been avoided if the lady pharmacist at this location filled my dog's prescription and did her "research".
If there was a way to give zero stars I would  My family walked in the door at 4:50 and my son had to use the restroom so my husband went to grab a high chair and table with my other son  When he finished (is is 5 and takes forever) we walked straight to the counter to order for their "happy hour"  The lady said it was over rudely  I looked at my phone it was 5:01  Seriously  She saw me walk in and use the restroom and at the very least she saw husband waiting for me  We were the ONLY people in there  We ordered nothing an left  I don't like terrible attitudes and rude customer service I will never go back there.
Absolutely terrible The staff was unfriendly the whole experience was awkward and the food WAS TERRIBLE Both mine and my friend'sThere was one girl there at lunch timeAll the food was cold and was NOT FRESH at all Plus it was WAY too expensive for what you got Can't say terrible enough I feel nausea coming on just thinking about it Sorry PachucaI know business is tough and bad reviews suck but you need to step it up big time The place is pretty inside and COULD be awesome.
This restaurant is out of business I was really disappointed.
This restaurant is closed  It sounds like it wasn't soon enough.
This Safeway is THE WORST The lines are always super long the staffing is minimal and not enough to cover the customers shopping and the employees are rude/inappropriate While checking out once the checker and the bagger we're having a political argument and the checker turned to me and asked "Do you like Obama" That is not an appropriate questionThe only time I ever shop here is when it is more convenient and I regret my decision every timePlus my son is always disappointed that they don't have any fire truck shopping carts but I'll let him write about that in his own review whenever he learns to talk and write.
Worst Best Buy everI just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy somethingMethinks not  Never again  NEVER again.
Waited 3hrs to sit 5:30 to 8:33 the worse system for seating Don't ever go.
Yuck yuck yuck I can't believe this place has good reviews  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking  The other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away I decided to try Amados  Big mistake huge  Sure it's open 24 hours but so is the competitor around the corner and they offer tasty foodMy chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels  First off it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla and not in a good way  After a test bite or two I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before  :(  Finally the beans and rice had almost no flavor  I don't even know how that's possible rice sure  Beans tho  Because of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly just can't stomach the idea of it  Won't see ya there.
Terrible food  If you're looking for nasty variety Sonoran food then this is the place for you  I could deal with the 80's decor the mediocre margarita the meh chips and salsa (super watery)   With runny beans (my fav) an enchilada sauce that was blah and an inedible tostada I pretty much reached my limit  My boyfriend's green chile tamales were comparable to eating a sponge  Suffice it to say if left to sit for 10 minutes one could have eaten their dinner with a straw  Don't bother  You would be better off at Chipotle  Apologies to our waitress she was nice enough but didn't make up for the awful food.
Past memory said this place had the atmosphere we were looking for at breakfaststill does  Server was GREATthat's where it all ended  After we ordered food we saw lots of food going back to the kitchen  hmmmm  The our order came  moth my eggs and hash browns were not cooked as requested (yet on the receipt it stated properly)  rather than send back my whole meal asked for a plate as they wanted to recook the browns  they instead later brought out another plate of them and explained that was the most well done/crispy they could be  and they were not  as if they could not simply leave on grill longer  eggs were to be over well were REALLY runny and went all over the plate  We dealt with it did not want to cause more issues in a kitchen clearly having issuesFYI the gravy might look good but tastes like thick flour paste  avoid this  put in on a biscuit and a country fried steak and basically I'm burping up bad flour for a few hoursfinally got the bill  they chose to do nothingwe ordered bloody mary's screwdrivers had a nice tab  they really messed up the food  simple told the waitress that she was great but the kitchen let her down  was disappointed they chose to not do anything for us based on the issues  She explained she could not but she took to managerManager comes out and wondered why we did not go to her since the waitresses "don't have authority to do anything" she had attitude over it  nicely put  she looked at us and after I explained the issue she actually stated "but you ate most of it right"  OMG  We re-explained we saw all the prior issues with other tables and dealt with it but did tell the waitress at the time  She comped us a cup of coffee  WOWTHANKS  $50 breakfast tab and a free cup of Joe  well done  Turns out this lady is actually the owner  I told here she should fire herself  She couldn't understand why I would say such a thing  I explained how poorly she handled the situationnot to mention that the food was wrong (and simply not that good)  Frankly me never going back is punishment enough  I'd avoid this place  And especially avoid the manage/ownerrshe's not pleasant.
And the Herb Box does it again I knew not to go back after the terrible service but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it  So what happens I check my bank statement and they charged me twice  Once for my meal and an additional charge for 137 bucks  I'll change this review if they handle it well but I'm not holding my breath.
Ok for manicures Staff is unfriendly and talk about the customers in foreign tongue      My recent pedicure was horrible because the tech was digging into one of my nails Ouch.
This hotel tries really hard to be like other W Hotels in the chain but fails miserably My friend and coworker from Italy's iPhone was stolen by the housekeeping staff When we confronted Management about it they completely blew us off and were very dismissive We were all in town for a worldwide conference and my friend realized when we arrived at the venue that he had left his iPhone behind We used find my iPhone and saw it was still in his hotel room We contacted the hotel and they said they would send it over to us A few hours later they called to let me know his phone was not in the room We checked find my iPhone again to see the iPhone had been turned off (it was plugged in while in the room so the battery was not dead) Do not leave anything of value in the room It's very sad a hotel which charges these rates hire criminals and don't take responsibility.
I wanted to try this place and called Sunday night 8:45pm to see what time they closed  Some guy answers and says "Uhhhhhhh Nine"  The long pause made me think he was looking at the clock and making up the closing time as he goes so I asked if that was their normal hours  He said no they close whenever it's slow  Uh ok lazy but at least honest  So I asked what time they'll be open till tomorrow  He said Mondays nine  The next day I called at 7:45pm to confirm business hours  Some guy (probably the same one) said they closed at 8pm  WTF  I said I called yesterday and was told they'll close at 9 today  He then goes "Ohhhhhh  The restaurant IS closed at 9  But the KITCHEN closes at 8"  Are you kidding meI will never go to this Dillon's in my life because if they are that lazy irresponsible unprofessional and rude just answering the phone how are they at cooking or serving my food  Sadly if it's only the host doing this making up restaurant hours according to when his lazy ass wants to work then they need to fire him for pushing business away  I get it if some places open till 11 or 12 and if they close 1/2 hour early because the place is slow that's understandable  but to tell me the kitchen closes at 8pmWho ever owns / runs / manages this chain of Dillons needs to change their policies or this host.
Been here twice The first time the waitress spilled food on me and with no apology I returned again another time just to appease my daughters Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs But my real gripe was the glasses They were filthy All of them I couldn't use them they just put me off The inside of the glasses had this build up of grime and dirt on them  I won't be going to this place again.
scary unless you are homeless stay away disgusting unsanitary hole in the wallmanager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food hometables sticky bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop pealing paint and unkept  carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while.
I live close by so I keep coming back but this may be my last time The food is really good - the service however is slow and disorganized  It was 25 min after I ordered when I asked when it might be ready The people sitting around me were having the same issue - very disappointing.
I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style When asked if I needed any assistance the answer to "yes I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color" should not be to say "hold on a few minutes while I" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answerSave yourself the hassle and go check out pretty much anywhere else I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something.
Maybe their dogs are better but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting The English muffin was spongy the eggs greasy the bacon undercooked And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese Yuck.
This review is basically for AT & T in general - not this store however I want to make sure everyone realizes how they treat their clients I was a client for over 20 years I made the decision to change to Verizon and I called and was told that my contract expired on February 1st I canceled my account on February 2nd You all know that you pay your bill in advance so I was paid from 1-22 through 2-22 Paid my bill Thought I would get a credit for the unused 20 days Not so You get zero credit So here is a caution to everyone Your contract expiration date is one thing but you must pay through the entire cycle even if you are no longer a client Horrible customer service Horrible.
Made reservations through Opentable on 12/22 for reservations at 8:15 pm at Prado on 12/31/12 for a New Years and my birthday celebration  Called Prado the next day to confirm just to be sure  On the day of the reservation hostess called me and left a msg to see if we were doing New Years Eve menu or not  Upon calling back we were notified that there were no 8:15 spots like we had booked and there was only seating at 6 or 9 and only a New years eve menu was to be offered at either $90 (at 6pm) or $150 (at 9 pm) per person  This was quite inconvenient especially since I am a vegetarian and was counting on being able to order from the regular dinner menu  Manager had no suitable solutions to offer us and we cancelled  Extremely disappointed in opentable and Prado  WIll not dine here in the future and will unrecommend to others.
We had a very frustrating and disappointing experience with Nova Home Loans Although we are very well qualified buyers our loan processor seemed unable to understand our financial picture We responded in a timely manner to all requests for information even when that information was clearly unnecessary to the loan process and cost us money out of pocket Our loan processor was consistently unable to articulate what was needed and worse offered erroneous information to the seller's agent a clear breach of ethics When Nova Home Loans informed us days before escrow was set to close that they could not fund our loan we went to our preferred lender in CA Logix was able to fund our loan within 10 days Unfortunately that was too late for the sellers and we lost the house Very disappointing and inconvenient to say the least We were able to close on another home but paid $20000 more than originally planned due to rapidly escalating home prices in the Phoenix area Although some members of the team were courteous on the phone we cannot recommend Nova Home Loans to anyone hoping to buy a home in the Phoenix area.
Locker Room sucks assThe locker room is WAY too small  they have a whopping two benches that comfortably sit 4 each so a whole 8 people fit in the entire room at any given time The rest of the locker room is wasted by "premium" lockers that virtually NO ONE uses Then there's the very awkward positioning of chairs where people can hang out and lounge in the locker room while you are changing in front of them And although there's signs that say "no cell phone use" in the locker room the people in those chairs usually have their phones out with backside cameras facing YOUUndependable shower water temperaturesThis places has gone weeks without hot water in the showers and it's always hit and miss It's been over 3 months and they can't seem to get it rightMachines in various states of disrepairThis place is brand new and still there are numerous machines in  various states of "broken-ness" It's just amazing to me that these machines are left broken for months on end Do they ever use their own equipment"Opps for got to tell you"So while getting the sales tour we were shown the tanning bed of which the salesman just forgot to tell us that it was an extra charge After telling management about this scam the response was "sorry"One decent thing is that they supply razors q-tips antiperspirant bodywash cream rinse and shampoo in the locker room/showersI wish I had gone back to the YMCA rather than get locked into a 2 year deal with this poorly managed gym The Y does not have any long term contracts and they have a pool racquetball courts basketball courts (of which Gold's has none) along with two workout rooms and all cheaper and without a long contract .
Eff you United for pushing us on a plane "Serviced by US Airways" for one of the most miserable flying experiences of my life  Also if you accept our reservation at least check us in at your desk - rude lady at the counter in SJ almost got joy from telling us we had to get back on to the bus (with our 5 bags - which by the way they charged us $110 for there and $195 for back) and head to sorry ass Terminal CTo make things worse in Phoenix the wait to check in was over an hour and a half  Got to the airport 2 hours and 15 minutes before our flight and because of US Airways total crap service we boarded our plane with only 10 minutes to spareAnd while this not their fault - but because you've been stressed and miserable dealing with the idiots inside the airport - you are just destined for two bumpy ass flights while in the skyMaking a fart sound Giving 1 star and now I'm an exclusive Southwest flier.
I ate at BLD tonight which was the first time in awhile to eat there and I know it's going to be a long while until I eat there again The WORSE service I have ever had Not only was the table I was at getting bad service I noticed the four other tables in the restaurant were getting just as neglected Our waitress seemed too busy making herself a cappuccino and leaning against the bar to talk to the bar guest than it was to refill myself and guests drink for 45 minutes We had empty drinks throughout the whole dinner up until we left because she would not refill them She never came by to quality check the food either or even just a walk by I heard another table complaining about the service as well She concluded the dinner by slamming the check down on the table and continue walking There was no manager in sight for us to talk to Overall it was the worse dining experience ever The food is good but that does not outweigh the horrible service I recommend going somewhere else with the whole package.
The first time I went a few months ago service was horrible I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it again last night It will be my last time goingGood: the yellowtail was goodBad: small portions horrible serving staff For the second time our server ruined our experience We sat outside and listened to her complain about her boyfriend for stretches of time while waiting to order more sake etc She walked out on the east patio door and helped a table there multiple times then walked back in the same door to disappear again without checking on us I HATE flagging down a server because its rude but we had to do it every time we wanted something There wasn't a single "is everything ok" or "can I get you anything else" the entire time we were there When we did place the order the food/drinks came out quickly so the bartender and food runners were spot on The server just ruined the entire experience Again We clearly heard her bitching about her boyfriend Apparently he wants her to quit working there Honey take his advice You suck at itI'll be sticking to Sapporo right down the road Better portions and WAY better staff.
I have since moved on to bigger and better establishments My opinion was clouded over by my five foot lover's insistence that I not "waste" moneysayonara GC.
the Fox corporation owns this one along with it's next door neighbor  " J Alexanders"I havent made a meal in my kitchen for years and depend upon the good restauranteurs of Phoenix for sustanenceSadly these two places mentioned herein are  now off the rotation list of places to eat WE have watched the corporate cutbacks on food quality gradually decline into unacceptable levelsSeptember 23rd  I ordered fish tacos with a side of guacomole What I got was three miniscule 3 inch tortillas each containing a very small  less than bite size piece of fish I have seen these small tortillas at other eateries served as appetizers in portions of three just like this offering The fish tacos were about 15 bucks The side of guacomole was 9 bucks Even if the food was excellent  (which it was far from) the portion size was pathetic  Just a bad deal all way around Locals avoid it now and apparently the locale next to several hotels may keep it going Unsuspecting tourists be warned AVOID this one.
Rude doctor Long wait Doctor confused me with another patient and never apologized Nor was my issue resolved Run away from this practice.
I enjoyed this place in the 90's But I really don't see why it still exists Does anyone buy CD's anymore I can get any DVD/BluRay I want on Ebay If I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencer's in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself "cool" Perhaps its time Zia faded away like the VCR or countless other  pieces of 20th century technology.
Worst customer service experience ever My boyfriend bought a pair of rimless frames and was upsold on super pricey "high index" lenses that were supposed to be thinner than normal ones (They were virtually the same)They came in (after the first three pairs from the lab failed quality inspection) and we had to wait for an hour while they put in the extra set of lenses because the initial set had a bubble The second set they put in seemed ok till we were home and he noticed that there is a small watermark on the lenses visible in each eye's field of view AND the lenses weren't even cut to fit the frame correctly These are $600 glasses by the way just sayin' We spoke with a very unapologetic and defensive manager/supervisor Angel who was shaking because she was so angry (that she had to offer customer service to someone with legitimate concerns) said the markings are standard and they couldn't do a perfect cut with the frame he selected  I was very thrown off by her behavior since the customer in this situation was being really calm and friendly about the whole situation I've verified since then that these markings and off-cut are not standard at most quality retailers and I have a hard time believing it is for a trusted name brand like LensCraftersHe reordered the glasses with regular polycarbonate lenses so that he wouldn't have to deal with indicator markings They told him it would take up to two business weeks to fill the order After two weeks passed he called Angel said she would call him back and never did This happened twice and because he wasn't getting any return calls he finally decided just to go in to the store When he did they did in fact already have the glasses and he waited for her to prepare them -- not sure how long they were sitting in the storeIt ending up taking over a full month to get these glasses In the meantime the immature manager and the sales rep Marina that we worked with offered no apologies at all  Apparently once you've paid they don't want to deal with your issues I found the experience really disappointing because I've always had extremely positive dealings with LensCrafters in the past but we won't go to this  location again in the future.
If I could negative stars I would I bought a GroupOn originally came in for visit They sold me on $99 full body contract I went for several months no real complaints Then in November Simplicity cancelled my appointment and rescheduled without notifying me until after this Once I get a call for new appointment time I tell them I cant do that time The rep on the line said well we are busy till late December I said so you are going to charge me $99 for a service I didn't receive She said well I can add free month to the end of your contract I did not feel like arguing with her about how that is not how you handle this situation Later December comes around for my appointment and I get a call at 10:10 am saying you miss your appointment I said no it is at 3:00 pm The lady on the phone said well sorry we cant get you in now I call 1/2 because the billing department was closed for the holidays I get a hold of a lady and she said sorry it was our fault We can offer free month at the end of the contract I was like OMG how is this acceptable practice If they were getting charged $200 and no service wouldn't they be upset So I tell the lady to issue a refund to my credit card and cancel my contract She said she would have to look into that I called my credit company after that call and requested a charge back and STOP on any future charges from this company NEVER AGAINReviewing the treatment: This is my first laser hair removal I have notice a thinning of hair going there for some time now But I am not impressed on how I still have lots of hair I would think I would be bald by now but just thinning.
Well we got our clothes back - I suppose that is deserving of at least one star And they were reasonably pressed and looked acceptable Unfortunately whoever staples those numbered pieces of paper through the button holes of shirts is a bit overzealous on his or her stapling Of the 10 shirts left 4 had multiple staples actually stapled through the shirt fabric I've actually never had this happen anywhere else in all the years I've been using cleaners This might not seem like much of a deal until you go to pull the paper off and actually rip the shirt in the process Stick to your iron and water or find another cleaner that pays more attention to detail.
Their website says they can bring any flavor to an event Apparently they can do that but not professionalism I put a request for a small order to set up for my family for Christmas time Since I'm not there I obviously can't cook anything so I always set up a catered dinner that they just need to go pick up I asked if it was possible and they said I was a joke and to go to Fry's As a business owner myself no matter what the request is you should respond in a kind and professional manner I encourage people interested in this business to try other caterers before this one.
Terrible experience Staff was rude and disrespectful guy had a serious attitude problem We waited 40 minutes for a sandwich and salad and i got back to my office and my food wasn't what i ordered  I don't eat meat and they gave me a chicken salad I emailed Saldworks  to voice my concern I was told they would send me a coupon for a free meal and gave them my address  Was seriously annoyed but id give a  second chance with a coupon Never received coupon its been months  Wont ever go again  You treat your customers like crap you get crappy Yelp reviews.
Well guys I dont have much to say thats gonna be nice about this place My dinner here was like someone used my tortilla as toilet paper threw some cheese in it rolled it up and stuck it on my plate Just in case I was not sure of the flavor i was experincing the stuck a nice big spoonfull of what was in my tortilla on my plate and called it beans The only thing mexican about the food is they say its mexican and perhaps they keep their tortillias in the bathroom (kitchen) to use as toilet paper and cut down their cost and staffing of a real cook.
Bottom line Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is NOT worth your business Save your time and money Your car will not properly be tended to and the staff especially the Management (Oscar and Martin) couldn't be anymore unprofessional or empathetic If you care about actually having your car washed this is NOT the place to go I have been a faithful customer to this specific location for 3 years since moving into the Biltmore I used to get my gas oil-changes and vehicles washed here but time and time again (chance after chance) my car was left to air dry rims never cleaned or towel dried forgotten about the air freshener etc I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off It is clearly the most unorganized group of employees I have every witnessed at a car wash facility I'm a reasonable guy but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office that I ended up leaving 3 messages for requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention A week later I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls A week after that call a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore I was appalled and tad confused Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call This is a lot to read but if it helps you to make a more informed decision and avoid some serious frustration let alone having to get your car re-washed then great If anyone would like photos (clearly showing the facility my vehicle  and its neglect please let me know) I also have a video showing a Mercedes that was hand washed after mine (the guys spent an extra 3 minutes and 23 seconds on a vehicle twice as small as mine)  Regards Chad B.
After heavy shopping I tried to get out of my comfort zone and try Rubios I got the original taco Boy was that sucker dry Even after downing it in hot sauce it still tasted like a microwavable fish fillet and the portion of the fish unlike the huge picture displayed was like the size of an anchovy   Also I was displeased when the lady at the counter when I asked for a small drink cup gave me a  regular cup I saw another customer had a small cup What a waste of money $6 for a crappy meal honestly this place makes Chipotle fine dining.
charged my card multiple times and cant get them to fix it  Place blows anyhow El Hefe across the street is a much better destination.
I have been craving Boba since I had an avocado one last month in Berkeley (it sounds disgusting but for some reason that I can't quite figure out it is delicious)  Anyways I remembered that there was a Boba place on Mill when I got back into town  The first time that I tried to go there the rude "cooler than you" crusty punk girl behind the counter shut me down  They were out of boba and it seemed like she wanted to shoo me out the door since I had inadvertently cut her smoke break short I left and came back a couple days later only to find out that they had closed early  A few days after that I came back again and the same annoying crusty punk girl seemed put off that when she had to actually get up and make a drink for me  The drink was delicious  I figured that I could put up with the attitude of what apparently is this shop's only employee  Once again I went there and dealt with the same standoffish crusty  Once again the drink was delicious although she apparently didn't want to spend the time to blend it fully so there were huge chunks of ice in the bottom of the cup  Anyway this place sucks and it sucks bad except for the drinks  I really don't want to support this place ever again but I might be forced to if a cannot find another equally delicious boba drink.
WORST RESTAURANT EVER  Mediocre atmosphere (at best) 1/4" thick (at most) tv-dinner "ribeye"  frozen corn probably frozen prepared potato and to say it had a tv-dinner flavor would be a compliment  We picked up McDonald's on the way home seriously.
Don't stay here The rooms are old the door was falling off the hinges light fixtures chipped the bathroom calling leaked right over the toilet there are cigarette butts all over the ground the majority of the staff could careless you are a paying guest The wifi occasionally worked It was a very uncomfortable experience.
Service was very slow Wait staff was not very well educated about the menu  Beer was tepid I had the tacos which were fine and the rice and beans were average The wife had the Chille Verde and she said it was average as well However the waiter forgot to bring the tortillas and we had to hunt him down to finally get them  They had one bus boy trying to pass out chips and salsa and clean the tables it was easy to see he was the hardest working person in the restaurant  However because he was the only person cleaning while the hostesses sat around and gossiped and the manager was hiding someplace the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes The highlight of the evening came while watching the 2 hostesses continue to place patrons in a booth that had a broken light fixture After being seated each group of guests would ask for the light to be fixed  The first time the manager came over and tried a light bulb which she had swiped from another location in the restaurant only to find that it wouldn't fit She was nice enough to move the guests to another location but within just a couple of minutes the two hostesses had found a new victim to sit in the booth It was comical to watch the show play itself out again and again The bottom line is that the restaurant business is tough  and competition in the Mexican food arena is very strong so  I don't expect this Garcia's location to be around very long.
Their website states they are open on weekends pretty much all day So my husband called to get us a reservation because for some absurd reason you need a reservation to use their groupon They didn't answer so he thought they were busy and called back Eventually someone picked up and made him a reservationWe showed up on time and the first thing out of the waitstaff's mouth was "So are you the guy who called 17 times" Um I don't think it was 17 times but yeah sure guilty The thing was that the asshole was relentless Embarrassing us in front of the other customers We tried to explain that the website AND the voice mail gave us incorrect information but the guy Paolo still ended up blaming us by saying "you should have left a voice mail" and "Everyone was sleeping and finally someone woke up to answer roe you" He didn't even apologize and definitely made us feel like we were at fault If he would have taken ownership of the issue it would have been a lot different I could take the first snide comment and let it roll but he wouldn't come off it nor apologize Then we thought hey if they are mad that we woke the cooks up then maybe they'll mess with our food or somethingWe felt so embarrassed and ridiculed and everyone was staring at us so we just left I work hard for my money I'm not going to spend it on assholes when there are so many other delicious restaurants to choose from.
I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try My first impression walking in was "eh" could be better could be worse The service however- Couldn't get any worse I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH Nothing good about that thing I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla She made me a full sized instead This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful The quesadilla was pretty darn good Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again.
I have used this repair service for several years and have found an extreme decline in service The 2 most recent times I used them they raised the prices without telling me in advance of the service Both of of these times services that were performed rather than taking the promised one week took instead close to three months with me returning over and over on new projected completion dates to incompleted work Worst of all brand new never worn pair of expensive shoes that were brought in only for stretching were damaged They were returned to me with huge gouges on the patent leather high heelsNeedless to say I have found a new shoe repair.
One star is too many for this place We just went for the first time tonight Our waitress was slow and lazy We waited 15minutes before the server "noticed" us (she was busy talking to coworkers) We ordered some sushi and spring rolls The sushi is cheap and skimpy spring rolls were bland We ate less than 1/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers) With no more to drink and sitting waiting to get help for 1/2 hour the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else We said "no" because nothing was good She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table We were comped a good portion of the bill but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal We will not be back In summation the food was poor quality the service was awful management is mia No idea how this place stays open.
This place has a cool retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the loveliness ends there   First off the entrance is kind of awkward  As soon as you walk into the "bistro" you are in the middle of the restaurant traffic pathway  It is a small place and you feel somewhat cramped and there was no host/hostess in sight  One of the bartenders greeted us and let us pick our spot (there weren't too many options) so we sat by the door  The bartender took our drink order (which by the way they only serve half bottles of wine but still charge full bottle prices) and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order  We perused the menu several times and were still waiting on the waitress to come our way  She passed by us many times but seemed too concerned with the other tables  Finally we palce our order after the bartender had to tell her many times that we were ready  We split a salad and then placed an order of the Buffalo stax and the "build your own" beef stax  They never asked how we wanted them cooked and to be quite honest it did not dawn on us until we were eating them but mine arrived "very well done" and my boyfriend's arrived raw in the middle and burned on the outside  Needless to say we were upset but very hungry and ate what we could  I think the staff is too preoccupied with keeping a trendy Scottsdale image that they lack quality on the food and service level  It's quite a shame b/c the location is great and they would have no problem keeping regulars coming to an overpriced burger joint  I would never go back here again  The meal made both me and my boyfriend ill before we made it home (only 10 minutes away)If you want an overpriced but yummy burger then go to Deluxe Burger.
Ugh They have some good commercials for this place currently playing Unfortunatelythat's where the "good" stops with this place Everything was terrible from the service to their food I think their Diet Coke even tasted horrid We ordered their Mexican Waffle with ice creamthey actually made Eggo's taste good which is not saying much Frost bitten and just ewww If a 6 yr old doesnt want dessertsomething's wrong with your place I will NEVER go here again and if this saves even one person from eating here I feel I've done my job Do yourself a favor and don't go here it's disgusting.
I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus  This woman was soo rude she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu the nerve) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us rolled her eyes shook her head and then darted into some back room (SERIOUSLY is that a joke)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating there was one othe so we just got up and left all together  I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family Super disappointing  What ever happened to good customer service.
I have a couple basic guidelines when it comes to restaurants First any place which actively advertises is probably not very good If it doesn't sell itself by word of mouth there's probably a reason Second Indian restaurants which offer a dinner buffet aren't very good I see it as an act of desperation to save a failing business Still I figured I'd give India Oven and their dinner buffet a tryMost things on the buffet were below average Nothing stood out as particularly good and a few things were pretty terrible The worst offender was the rice It was so hard and crunchy it was inedible This problem was compounded by the fact that we waited forever for our naan Naan is thin bread cooked in one of the hottest ovens used for cooking food it takes less than a minute to cook Once we got it though it was pretty decent The tandoori chicken was ok but it had a sour taste to it like it had been sprayed with lime juice and left to soak it in The chicken didn't taste super-fresh either so it might have been cooked and rewarmedAs for the service it mainly consisted of about 10 people milling around the small dining room refilling water asking how the meal was and being confused about what went where I'm still looking for a great Indian place in the valley but I've had much better food at Royal Taj in Tempe and Star of India in Ahwatukee.
The cool name of the place is the only good thing here The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word) messy Fries too greasy Seating not comfortable Skip it.
We just had the worst dining experience since we have moved here at this place We had been regularly eating here about once a week and even recommended it to some friends however since we first starting frequenting this location the service and quality of food has been sliding downhill over time Tonight was the final straw so to speak we will not return After having to wait a ridiculous amount of the time while the manager got our table ready (It was not crowded at all and he could be seen back in the kitchen doing things) After a ten minute delay we were finally seated and we waited and after about five more minutes we were about to get up and leave when the manager came over to take our drink order About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table to verify our drink and appetizer order (why) so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks (water) When the appetizer finally came my salad and my fiance's clam chowder were on the tray at which point the waitress asked if we wanted the two items with our appetizer We said yes because why would we want to wait when they have already been thawed and the waitress had already brought them It was another 10-15 minute wait till out entrees arrived and mine was not what I ordered I asked the waitress and she said "Yes that is what you ordered" then backtracked and said she would check with the kitchen Apparently the manager said it was okay to prepare me the proper order but I was not notified So after sitting and waiting another ten or fifteen minutes the waitress came by and asked if I had been told that they were preparing the correct dish I said no and she said it would be out soon The Manager never came by our table for I think he did not want to hear the complaints since it was obvious we were not happy especially after all the wait time Finally about 5 minutes after the waitress informed me that I would get the proper meal it came out and was obviously "hurried" We asked for the check and received yet another ten minute wait and when we looked at it I was appalled that we were given no discount whatsoever for the issues The Manager still never came by our table and would not even look in our direction This place is such a disappointment when we started eating there it was great well priced good service good quality The last 4-5 times we have been there it has been horrible and tonight was the worst I really do hope that the Owner/Managers see my review for they have lost our business and we ate there frequently and we will not continue to tell people to try it.
This bar is terrible in all ways possibleBar: Overcrowded and overpriced You will wait/push/shove/yell for at least 5 to 10 minutes to get any drinkInside: Crowded to the point where you have to manhandle the other patrons to get anywhere The dance floor is the size of a civic hatchback Outside: The patio is tiny and always overcrowded just like the insidePeople: 21 - 25ish all tattoo artists (ie chronically unemployable) and they all know each other The patrons of this bar think that trying to "act hard" and draw pictures on peoples' arms is a productive ventureChilly Bombers is the culmination of bad design bad service and useless people all mixed together.
Don't believe the hype I heard about their "awesome" margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving Arizona First the bartender was an a--hole I asked for the rita I've been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord I told myself this must not be the thing I've heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup - which had VERY LITTLE cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea After all of this grossness I asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen He told me that their best ritas WERE the frozen ones When I heard that I got Z'Hell outta that place Can't wait to be back home in Dallas for a REAL rita at Ojeda's and Monica's.
No thank you I ordered the red stew to go which comes with fried bread Took 10 minutes to deliver a pint of what can only be described as awful beef/veg soup Similar to Cambell's but had obviously been sitting over heat for the day as all the veggies were gooey soft and the meat dry ICK The fried bread was equally disappointing - flat (not fluffy) and had a horrible bitter taste which could only have come from old oil  Dirty no working AC.
Boo Went with a big birthday group after confirming business hours Got their well over 30 mins before their posted closing business time Told us kitchen was already closed and turned us awayI would understand if it was a bar/sportsbar where they have last calls for kitchen food and a bar to operate later than their kitchen If a restaurant has certain hours I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time May take a while for me to want to come back here Even tried to plead our case and it was a no go as the host sat there counting his money Wow.
In 18 years of sushi eating Ra is 1 of 2 places I have ever sent something back  Review complete.
So there's no negative stars too bad Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing you couldn't pay me to eat hereThe only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings Where'd they get their chef Chili's What a disappointment All the reviews say ' a lot of food' for who an infantI had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well Didn't know deep fried greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies' Good grief the bakery wasn't even good Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.
Had sod installed by them At first they were very prompt but soon after the work was scheduled there was always a scheduling issue After the sod was finally installed late I might add there were problems with the sprinkler system that they just replaced all the heads on as they were crooked and not high enough I was told when they came to look at the sprinklers that I was keeping the grass too long They have attempted to remedy the sprinkler issues twice now with no luck but the problem is that they used too short of a sprinkler Previously my sprinklers were 4 inches tall this allows them to be placed further in the ground but yet extend higher above ground but Green ServPro removed all of them and put in 2 inch sprinklers which is what is causing all the sprinkler problems Tyring to cut the grass shorter was a joke because when they laid the sod the yard was either not smoothed out well enough or they didn't roll the sod properly because when you try to cut it some parts of the lawn end up scalped because of the uneveness of the lawnI never had issues with the sprinklers or the uneveness of the lawn before Green ServPro removed the old lawn and resodded it I decided to give Green ServPro one last chance and have them overseed my lawn for winter grass as they sent me an offer in my email After attempting to contact them twice in regards to this I have yet to hear anything from them and believe that they hope I will just go awayDealing with the office staff is no better as the lack of communication is laughable with this company How places like this stay in business is beyond me.
I was really excited to try this restaurant and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out The service was very friendly and the store was clean cute and colorfulbut the food was very disappointing My husband ordered the curry chicken and although it tasted okay he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes but the "Calypso Pasta" I ordered had tiny tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chickeninstead of the boneless white strips I was expecting and really it was just mediocre I'm bummed I wanted to like this place.
My wife use to work there they don't wash their hands they use expired sauces from a FEW years back and treat their staff like animals the food tastes good but if you get a stomach ache after you know why Here's a tip don't eat the salad.
I also purchased a voucher through livingsocial  I had left several messages and finally got a call back but missed it  The message left (@ 8pm) stated they were 'in the office now' and provided another number  I called right away and received the same mailbox that you get when you call the number on the voucher  I have now left several messages over the past few weeks on both numbers - still no return call  I have contacted livingsocial to advise them that this business may no longer be active.
The customer service here is beyond ridiculous Late check in because staff is on their own agenda and rooms were not clean in time (I waited 2 hrs dyer I was supposed to be able to have access to my room) the mgr on the floor Leesa laughed me when I registered a complaint a out the cleanliness of the room the security in rooms is poor (drunk guests entered my room through my patio) the service at the restaurant is slow and no one seems to care about the guests or their stay I figured the only thing I can do is write a yelp review because there is no one else that will do anything.
Very poor customer service there staff has an attitude I won't ever step foot in their store again because of the amount of disrespect they gave me.
Goddady is suck company i hate this fuck company .
Let's be honest here-- We don't get our nails done for the actual polish its the pampering that mattersThat being said I got a french tip spa pedicure My nails came out decent enough though i haven't had them more than a couple a days so i'm not sure about chipping just yetIt was a weekend afternoon around lunch so of course we had to wait a few minutes no problem The color selection isn't that great and the bottles seem a little on the old side but this place isnt exactly expensive I mentioned i wanted french tips and she still insisted i pick out a color Strange but i select the whitest white i could find on the wall We get seated about 15 minutes later put our feet into the water great temperature but our "massage" chairs do not turn on/vibrate/move at all well that's weird but i guess not the end of the world She sits down in front of me to turn on the jets and spends about 3-5 minutes turning it on to no avail She simply gave up and instructed me to soak my feet There were at least 4 other chairs open and when i asked if it didn't work she just said "no" and proceded to prep the area I thought she would maybe try to make up for the lack of massage chair and whirlpool jets with a decent leg massage but NO Basically applied lotion and didnt even scrub my heels with any pressure I will need to go home and do it myself after the shower THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLETotal came out to $29 (regular price) without tip and with NO apology for the broken amenities DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Are YOU kidding me This very morning I walked over to this "hidden treasure" as I had found it a few weeks ago  I saw the fantastic baked goods and couldn't wait to share with my friends I wouldn't spend a nickel hereRude Rude Rude10:20 this morning I was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet  I spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin as I'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd  I said and lunch is when  He says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and I need this table so I proceed to another and that was the wrong table too  He wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun  I asked if he was kidding I had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitableThe little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and I'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to goI'm not wanted here The queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up pipes up to tell me that I do not need to buy the muffin - I told her she was absolutely right and walked out.
I'm literally writing this review at 2:45 am from my room at Zona Suites and Resorts  I would rather be asleep but alas sleep will not be what I am getting tonight  Aside from the bed feeling like a padded half pipe (can't keep from rolling into the center) the noise that you hear inside your room is insane  There are a group of people by the pool They aren't being obnoxious or loud so it doesn't warrant a call to the front desk - but you can literally hear every word  Plus half of the group is in the room above ours so every trip up and down the stairs is heard loud and clear  I would have gladly transferred to a different room (even at 2:45am) but I was told at check in that they were 100% full tonight and I could not get a room on the 3rd floor as I desired  The grounds are pretty - perhaps I should go walk around since it is clear I won't be getting any sleep.
Just not goodOrdered 2 wings which came with 2 sides I chose macncheese and refried beans  Wings were fried slightly overcooked and had no flavor  No salty no seasony nothing  Macncheese tasted a couple of elbow noodles swimming in warmed cream with a tablespoon of actual cheese plopped in the cup  Refried beans were soupy and slightly undercookedAlso ordered a wing drumstick thigh which came with 2 sides which were chosen as fries and corn on the cob  The man agreed his chicken was also slightly overcooked no salt no seasony nothing   Fries were that cool spiral cut concept but were chewy greasy and soggy  Corn was corn hahaI was hopeful that they would have a different style of fried chicken like at Pollo Campero  Eek Methinks not  At the end of the meal we came to the consensus they got everything they attempted wrong absolutely wrong  Im sad for them :( and sad for my $1500 dollars  I didnt even wanna write this review however I know this is exactly what Yelp is for  I took one for the team tonight  We win most and we lose some I definitely lost tonight.
If the previous owners are still in town I wonder if it makes them sad to see what happened to their specialty concept If you went to the original in Tempe or Ahwatukee (before they closed it in the early 90's) you could tell that their little gem would flourish in a larger space with some appropriate decor and ambiance specialty coffees etc Sadly while these changes were made by the new owners 5 or so years ago the quality of the product went downhill and the prices went up I recently tried a breakfast croissant again and I'd swear the croissant came from Costcoit was that mediocre Gone is the delicate blend of overnight proofed crispy exterior with layers of tender inner croissant I bought a filled croissant for later and it was so disappointing I'm embarrassed I let my taste buds down this way I've tried going back several times over the last few years I want to like them I want to support them but they are overpriced and underwhelmingI wont go back againIf you never went to the original owners' Pleassant Croissant and think P Croissant is greatcontinue to live in blissful ignorance I on the other hand mourn the loss of the father and son that delivered the original delicate delights that were worthy of praise and their price.
Pros:Ordered delivery got here fastCons:Wings were clearly freezer burntGarlic "Flavoured" crust had no flavourall the toppings (with the exception of pepperoni and cheese) were in a 2 inch circle in the middle of the 2 pies we gotCrust was very hard for being a pan crustAfter all was said and done (2 pies and an order of wings) it was kinda expensive for the qualityThis place has taken the top spot on my pizza to avoid list dethroning domino's.
what a waste of time service was the worse I have had in ages food was so so there are so many better places to go that care about the costumer will not go back.
Dingy dining room poor rushed sevrice Lobster bisque not fresh at all Chopped salad was all wilted as if it had been plated hours ago and then dressed All the veggies were wilted Chicken dish was rubbery served with overcooked broccoli and 2 dull potato wedges Quite pricey at $24 for a 6-7 ounce  chix breast Even the bread was subpar It was  torn pieces of ital bread not terribly fresh Being used to superior italian food in NYC and LA this place will never see me again.
I stop by and it was a nice place but the prices are a little too high I ordered the shrimp ceviche and it was the blend with no flavor whatsoever I don't think I'm coming back ALTATAS restaurant is the place to go avoid this poor imitation restaurant.
I can no longer hold myself back from speaking out against this unscrupulous tire dealer Yes J J is a true professional but his boss Ralph the owner leaves a lot to be desired I started doing business with C & R Tire back in July 21 2009 I bought a set of 4 tires for my pick up I continued to buy several sets of tires from C & R up to July 2010 for my trucks We then started having tire failure problems and this is when the owner got involved and destroyed any hope of any future business from me The tires started to form bubbles on the side wall or the thread itself This is not just one tire but every single one we bought The last set failed this week So far I have replaced 10 tires that I bought from C & R over the time period all with the same defective problem bubbles on the side wall or thread Upon the first 2 occurrences I called C & R JJ put me on to Ralph the owner The answer from Ralph was it was not their problem It was a road hazard and we were not covered In his own words I will never forget this because I wrote it down "You buy the lowest quality tire we have and you don't buy the road hazard protection what do you expect" Basically he was telling me that his lower priced tires do not meet the standards of the road without the extra warranty Road hazards happened to all the tires I bought from C & R  I now buy my tires from another reputable and well know dealer in town and I can tell you that I do not have to worry about the tires they stand behind their products I have not had one tire failure from this other dealer All tires from C & R failed Can that be just a coincidence I don't think so.
NEVER AGAIN  Getting ready for a road trip to California I decided to skip going to my regular mechanic and hit up Jiffy Lube - I even had a coupon  I am normally pretty tough when it comes to all the add-ons they try to sell you I'll replace my own air filter thank you very much  However this time they got me on the radiator flush  I figured it was summer we were driving through desert - better than having the car overheat right  WRONG  A bunch of monkeys with tools and hopped up on crack couldn't have been worse for my car  As I was leaving for work the next morning the car immediately overheated something it had NEVER done   I went right back to Jiffy Lube who gave me some line about it not being topped off  They never actually checked anything - they just patted my pretty little head and sent my on my way  I guess it's my fault for being an uppity female who wants to driveany way a block away the car temp started climbing again  So I went to a DIFFERENT Jiffy Lube hoping it was just the staff at the one by me  They also said that it wasn't their fault blah blah  Again I was treated like a moron because I am a girl  Finally one of the staff members working there risking their own job gave me the number of the regional franchise owner  But my car was still overheating  I gave up called my regular mechanic who sent a tow truck out Jiffy Lube cracked my radiator with their "flush" service  So $300 later I had a new radiator and a burning desire for revenge on Jiffy Lube  I suggest the only way you go to ANY Jiffy Lube is if you are taking your arch enemy's car or extremely masochistic.
First time here Went to see Christopher Titus This place is a place for comics to test new material Comic used cue cards Paid 60 bucks to go see him 2 drink minimum per person Took my wife Totally cool with that Had 4 or 5 cocktails wife had 3 Expected maybe a 80 dollar tab for less than a 25 dollar bottle of whiskey 150 bucks Are you f-ing kidding me Now I know why maybe 50 people showed up Never go back there again What a rip off I can get full bottle service at that price If I could id give this place negative stars Thanks for slapping the bill on the table after the comic is done with his test runs and starts with his good material Ruined the night Just wanted to take my wife out for her birthday.
I bought a new car from them last year and had a fine sales experience Unfortunately this month I had to bring the car back for a minor warranty issue and the Service Manger (Mark) was incredibly condescending and rude He argued with me over every detail of the work I needed done including getting into a semantic argument over the difference between a "pull" and a "drift" and made me regret having bought the car from them entirely I won't be back to Avondale Mazda and I will let friends and family know to avoid them as welledit: Go to Cardinale Way Mazda in Peoria or Camelback Mazda They will take care of you and treat you as a customer not an annoyance.
This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley  I think gas station sushi would have tasted better  The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can and the soda was flat  The only thing that tasted okay was the water.
MY REAL STAR RATING IS 0 STARSI will make this review very quick I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food I was totally wrong I called in my order for delivery and I ordered sweet and sour chicken and the Hunan beef with an extra egg roll and it came with crab puffs Lets first start off with the sweet and sour chicken It was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and the sauce was way too sweetit had huge chunks of pineapples in it it was soggy and disgusting I prefer to have my sweet and sour sauce on the side The Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all The veggies were Blah The crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls They weren't even egg rolls they were more like spring rolls but they still sucked They were horrible The worst egg rolls I ever ate in my life I would prefer Panda Express any day over this place The rice was dry and disgustingThis food made me sick After eating just a couple bites a few minutes later  My body immediately rejected it and it upset my stomach really badly I ended up releasing the food immediately through a bowel movement My body has never reacted like that before It felt like I had rocks in my tummy I felt weak and nausea and I believe I had a very short case of food poisoning Thank God I only ate a few bites  or I probably would have been sick for a couple days My suggestion is that they need to be closed down THEIR FOOD IS HORRIFIC RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.
Dropped my daughter off at her in laws house in South Phoenix and my son and I had some time to kill before we had to pick her back up and I wasn't into driving back into Chandler I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for usSo off we went it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait which we thought was pretty cool  When we got to our booth we talked about the times we had been there  and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery it was fun talking about the old memoriesWe went with the 2 for 20 deal and the food tasted great our service was friendly and fast it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on  he said mom just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feetI said WHAT He said yes it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right thenbut I didn't I left the tip because she was good and we leftYes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guyBUT OMG I hate mice I will not be coming back I know it happens more often than I would like to know about this was a place that held some fun memories for us but I am not looking to go back any time soon.
I wasn't sure whether I should write this review because I have a healthy fear of being whacked  Three co-workers and I sidled in one day and our first impression was that we were eating at a front for the mob  We felt less than welcome when we entered and none of the people by the cash register cared to acknowledge us  Begrudgingly we were given a table  The furniture was something out of an old folk's home  Everyone squeaked into their seats  We weren't sure whether we belonged and then we noticed that the only other patrons were old folks  My friend ordered pasta and paid extra for meatballs actually for one whole meatball  What I ordered was very forgettable  It took a while but we finally got our food which seemed odd as it was quite plain and entirely unremarkable  We split the bill with one person paying cash and the rest using credit cards  It took over ten minutes to get our cards back with receipts which was odd as we were the only people left in the place  The waitress admonished us for making her life difficult  I pointed out that my card had my picture on it and was told that was part of the problem  Immediately upon returning to the office we all checked our bank accounts  We were all charged for our meals except for one of my co-workers who was charged for all four meals even the one who paid cash.
Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to I recently opened an account online with Bank of America After nearly completing the application my computer timed out I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received But due to their crappy system restrictions I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not The following day I received an email stating that my account application had been approved and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving) and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later Going through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail) I found the signature card letter debit card debit card instructions debit card pin number and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed I called customer service to find out why the account had been closed and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done I asked why the account was being closed and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet and there wasn't any money in the account She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online and somehow that was suspicious I asked to speak with a manager and have currently been holding for 50 minutes Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.
Food is ok not happy with service my waitresses name was Rihanna or something she was very rude got our order wrong then didn't seem to care i suspect she spit in my sauce.
30 minute wait in a drive thru lane is completely redicolus There were only 2 cars ahead of us Way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance.
Horrible greasy foodGm didn't care at all when we complainedManagement reflects overall very poor experience My tummy still hurts.
I hate giving places ratings this low but I have no choice We have just recently moved here from Miwaukee where there are fish frys every Friday We gave up meat for Lent and wanted to get some fish a quick simple meal that we could take home  That's where Pete's comes in The food is disgusting It's like they have some deal set up with Arpaio where they get expired frozen prison food so that they can charge the prices that they do ( should have also been my first clue)   EVERYTHING is processed and they use the cheapest quality ingredients  I saw "crabettes" and thought they might be some type of fritter It's fried imitation crab sticks Service was good It's just the food that is so bad I understand it is a family business and has been in Phoenix forever which is super admirable I would hope that maybe they would just try to re-invent their menu a bit Fresh seafood for a chain like this is a lot to ask in the desert I think maybe if they paid an extra 20 per unit they could get a naturally formed filet of fish I will definitely not ever go back here.
Nothing seemed to go right here  The valet parking was a total disaster  When we were seated we walked all of the restaurant with the hostess not knowing where to seat us  Sat for a while before a server ever came over but I have a feeling that stemmed back to the seating issue  Food was OK but nothing to pull up the score.
Can't customize and the smoothie I got lacked flavor Plus it took forever and was expensive.
_the worst "mexican" Ive ever had_deserves no stars_because everything tasted like it came from a can (enchilada saucebeanssalsa)_because everything was made with absolutely no effort_it smells of sewage and cigarettes inside_dim lighting in restaurant and very dark parking lot.
Beware of Brandi She is the Rudest and Most Unfriendly employee I have come across in many years  She carries the biggest "I could care less about the customer attitude" possible  Before I could even order my 2nd item she turned he back on me and started packing the first item I ordered  When I asked a question about ordering wings pcs She was very short and snappy with her response When asked a follow up question she answered "that's the way it is NOW" It was as if she was a robot on an assembly line screwing nuts on a bolt While still trying to complete my order and talking to her she begins taking an order from a drive- through customer and ignoring me  Note: The restaurant was not busyAs a result of her I decided pay for the one item and leave I did not ordering the other chicken items sides and desserts I normally order when I do take out from KFC Todays' check was only 1400 I usually spend over 4000 at this location for takeout I then went down the street to Church's Chicken to complete my order  I prefer KFC's food but the service was much better at Church's She alone is reason enough for me not to return to this location.
Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me Two times they gave me someone else's food Every time I tried to check they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check I just wanted to try their salad Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects or are you going to take the time to do it rightWendy's of 301 E Indian School I hope you read this Moreover I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right I believe in you.
The food was okay The service was horrible We felt very rushed because the waitress kept coming back to take our plates and the last time was before one of us had finished our food It was 9:35 and the waitress came to collect our money for the bill without even asking nicely She said they needed to close out the till How rude Won't be going back.
I must fill you in on a Little back story before I tell you about my experience with Fletcher's Tire and AutoA month or so ago I had to get a mobile locksmith to come to me because my car wasn't starting with the key I had While the mobile locksmith was making the key I had an emergency call and had to leave right away He didn't finish the key but I put the key he was in the process of making in my carforgetting all about itForward to today I dropped my car off at Fletchers because something was going on with it and smoke was coming out of my engine They called me the next day to tell me that it was gonna cost me $55000 Thinking that we should get a second opinion the hubby and I went down to pick up the car When we pulled up we noticed that the car was in the same exact parking spot that we had left it in when we dropped it off but didnt really think too much of it at that time We told them that we were gonna take our car and get a second opinion they gave us our key back and we were on our way We tried starting our car with the key we left for them and it wouldn't start We used the master key and it started right up ( I had given them the key that the locksmith made for me not knowing it wouldn't start my car )When we got home I called Fletcher's back and asked them if they had any problems starting my car up ( damn well knowing they couldn't start my car ) and his response was" nope it started right up Didn't have a problem with it at all" how could that be when the key we had given them didn't start my car at allKnowing that they were dishonest we knew we weren't taking the car back there for the repairs it needed Long story short We ended up having it fixed for $10800 AND FLETCHER'S WASN'T EVEN CORRECT WITH THEIR DIAGNOSIS It turned out it was something totally different AND WAY CHEAPER What they said was wrong with my car wasn't what it was AT ALLI will NEVER take my car back there again I need to trust the people that work on my car.
I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday My experience was very different We went for a late breakfast It's best if I summarize my plate The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks mixed in as they were The hamburger patty was the driest least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy flat without any taste or salt I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day The service was nothing exceptional  I thought the place would have some charm but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else Never again It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing.
Nice customer service but that's it Worst fish and chips I have ever had And their Pete's sauce sucks hard Seriously please don't ever eat here I have stomach ache.
I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water Here's where the 1 star comes in Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired EVERY time I've ordered the same thing and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later but as I finally got up the courage to complain the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore Good Luck guys.
WARNING   This place has completely changed The only buffet they have now is the hot dog buffet with frys and drink that's it The all you can eat sandwiches are not included for any price You now have to pay for each individual sandwich Also the crab and prime rib is gone completely Of course before I came tonight I checked there website and nothing has changed there That is misleading as hell in my opinion This is my first time here and I won't be coming back The hot dogs are all cold and the buns are kinda hard Not good I will say the frys are very good and the guy behind the counter definitely felt bad about the changes The service has been excellent He gave me a free piece of chicken to try and make up for the changes     It was explained that they were bought out recently and the new owners were going to bring back some of the buffets but he didn't know which ones I recommend calling ahead before you come to find out.
I have given them chance after chance the only reason I return is because my wife and kids don't seem to mind the cold food that they serve here   At Breakfast time I have attempted to order the sausage burritos In return I get an item that is nearly room temperature The cheese has not even melted by the time I get it  I experienced this at least  on the last 3 occasions  At lunch I ordered a simple #1 meal  I received a cold burger I took it back to the register where they did apologize But in return I got another burger at the same room  temperature What gives I would have been happy if they would have just nuked the first one for a few seconds Burned yet againThe staff don't look like they want to provide any customer service let alone exceptional customer service I will be avoiding this location from now on.
I don't even want to give one star but you can't post if you don't mark anything so against my better judgement one star under protest it will beI have to say I will NEVER go back to this place again I don't know if management has changed but I can tell you that the service here has been continuously declining over the past year and TONIGHT was the W-O-R-S-T They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it Even when the place is almost empty it takes FOREVER to get your sushi We've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home at the time the service was excellent and fast and the quality and quantity was worth the price Forget that You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi We ordered a total of 4 count them 4 rolls tonight The first roll was delivered rather quickly Nice surprise however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently The second roll again not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later Wow we thought Service seems a little better than last time BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT Holy crap sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER yes I said AFTER we did but not our 2 measly rolls We also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well I finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible She said OK thank you so we walked out Hey wait a minute I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress You know we love and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills no pun intended.
The food was over-priced the portions were small and really the food was nothing special The service was just so-so as the server brought our appetizer after our entree was served My wife ordered a salad without bacon and they goofed that After they took it back they returned her a salad that was half of what she was previously served and it appeared they just removed a bunch of food from her plate rather than bringing her a new portion Very disappointing experience as I paid a lot of money only to go home hungry and dissatisfied I am certainly not going to go back to this restaurant.
Very disappointed  Spent over an hour with the sales girl paid a  deposit for the Fantasia phone told her we would be back Wednesday to pick them up  So on Wednesday after waiting another 30 or more minutes in the store to talk to our sales girl she told us no phones were available  A good salesperson would have called us and let us know before we made the trip in or told us when she saw us sitting there that the phones were not available  Too bad for her Will never do business with them  They took our money but had no phone  Not good business practice.
I went there 2 times for a back problem The first time they gave me full attention and i was very satisfied The second time they split my time with someone else and i had about 15 minutes of time However they had no problem charging my insurance company and myself for full service  When i called and complained they made all kinds of excusesand still wanted the money instead of saying it was the wrong thing to do Ipaid them  however i would never return buyer beware.
If it were only a review for the girl at the front who got got my order perfect we would give it a 5 star rating However the rating was diminished by 4 stars because of the incompetent man in the back He got simple order incorrect 3 times Upon finally getting it right he forgot to put Carmel on the top as requested an payed for After this he gave my sister iced tea without shaking it sweetening it or putting it over ice Really.
The place is called DESERT PEAKS now I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch Our company relocated our office off of McKellips We have been trying to look for a good lunch place DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also She was not attentive to our needs at all She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons It took 30 min for us to receive our food (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us The waitress never came back After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch She took my plate Then came back said she forgot what the other request was We told her ranch She brought back the ranch and my plate My fries were now cold One of my friends had pizza His dough was not baked in the middle It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni It was a HORRIBLE experience She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week.
TERMINAL 2Over the Xmas Break  we had a stop over at this airport I thought "not complicated been here before and we're not changing planes so what could happen"  So we land and they announce that all connecting flights will have to change planes blah blah  Ok no problem  then all of a sudden WTF  Our connecting flight we have to WUT  This is what we were told verbatim:"You have to leave the main airport wait outside for a skyharbor bus which will then take you to Terminal 2 re-check in at the counter and go through security  Have a Happy Holiday"  So we have less than an hour to make our connecting flight - we run outside (thank gawd we didn't have too many carry-ons) cross the street wait wait for OOH there's a bus - crap we missed it --- ooh another one we get on and goodness gracious --- Terminal 2 is HALF WAY TO BFE  We jump off and woah are we back in Kansas ToTo As a previous yelper stated Term 2 is an Abysmal Place (she describes it to a T)  After having to got through the hassle of re-checking in and going through their horrid security line (that could be another review in itself)  we make it to our gate as they are boarding with 15 min to spare & hear my hubby ventAvoid United Express flights if they have a connecting flight here YUCK.
I brought 9 shirts to be pressed and heavily starched The starch was  left with powdery residue all over the shirts ( all of them ) They must have a new press machIne that adds folds wrinkles and uneveness to garments because that is exactly what I got back In addition when I called to explain the situation I was told they could either send them out again ( which i did not have time for) or refund the cost I brought 1 of the garments back to the store and then the run around began After being told they didnt need to see all of the shirts just an example of what I was not happy with I arrived with my shirt and they then said I needed all 9 shirts to refund my money (  bs bs bs bs bs bs) if you said this on the phone then I would have brought all 9 shirts with me Next one of the female workers was totally unprofessional condescending borderline rude uncaring more interested in being right then customer service patronizing and just wrong in every way I was told a flat out lie ( twice ) and she was tripping on her tongue trying to cover it up Avoid this cleaners at all costs .
My husband and I love pho We are new to the area and have been trying out different restaurants Last weekend we decided to try this place for lunch The one star is for the awful service We were seated fairly quickly but it was at least 10 minutes before we were brought menus We waited another 10 - 15 minutes and still no water no one to take our ordernothing The restaurant was steady but not busy The employees seemed to be completely unengaged I can't remember the last time we walked out of a restaurant but after waiting close to a half an hour we decided to cut our losses and try another place We ended up at Saigon Pho which was wonderful - excellent food and service There are too many great places to eat in the Phoenix area to ever give this place a try again.
RATS See the manager's 'appology'  Hellhe didn't even visit our table on our less than acceptable experience and he never followed up on his promise via e-mail to take care of us with a discount next time we come in We still haven't received anything even though I gave him our address Apparently they could care less although they feel a need to do the requisite "lip service" giving the illusion they are concerned I've been coming here since they opened the Ahwatukee location and it was a favorite haunt for drinks after hitting 18 at Ahwatukee CC No more for me my family and anyone else I remember to tell about our experience.
I had been planning on getting a complete car detail somewhere and was still reading reviews on where to go but needed a quick wash in the meantime so I stopped by Dannys The Dannys salesperson Jorge presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included "we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now and come back for the detail when you have time The price started high then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined Finally came down to the "I give you good deal if you do it now includes complete interior and exterior wash engine clean and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork" Out of exhaustion sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me vacuum people waiting ahead of me and really needing the detail anyway I gave in signed the form gave them my credit card used my "free" quick wash and was on my way (average job on the wash then btw) Part 2- Finally scheduled and went in for my detail Upon arrival the "greeter" promptly looked in my window read the damn "need oil change" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles and suckered me in to that service too (whatever- convenience to me) I explained I was there for my detail They popped the hood Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal but apparently since he hadn't circled it it wasn't really included Jorge says "I can't give that for free you'd have to talk to the manager" When I asked for the managers name he seemed surprised that I would actually do it so I did The manager "Alex" was actually quite nice gave me the engine detail apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future I was told 25- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done So 4 hrs later I call find out it's done Pay for the oil change hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys So-overall results looked all bright and shiny at first but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it I drove away again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review Sorry for the long review but I hope it helps someone save the time money and energy Good Luck.
I do not understand what barbarians all of you 4 and 5-star reviewers were going to before you went to the European Wax Center but I had the worst brazilian wax of my life here  It took much too long hurt much too much left a great deal of hair in the exact areas that should have been waxed I had horrible ingrowns and the hair started growing back almost immediately  This means that the waxer was not pulling the hair out by the root but was breaking the hair off I can safely say after several years of having been waxed in the right way that this is not what brazilian waxing is supposed to be  Save your money and go elsewhere.
Not enough women's bathrooms to accomodate female audience wheras men breeze right in Female donors They will have none Further the acoustics are terrible Just guess the lines.
Went here with some buddies and we all had something different The food was really bad to begin with when my brother took a bite out of his burger it was raw ground beef yuck The chicken burgers were the same cold and under cooked I had the chicken salad and the chicken was under cooked as well But here is the worst we left comment cards which weren't bad Just stating the fact that the food was under cooked and tasteless As we walked by the waitress and the cook (some punk in a pony tail) were staring at us and the cook flips us off I was not about to have that some punk thinks he's all that in front of the girls So I walk back in and the goof runs off like a CHICKEN:) I spoke with the manager and he said he will take care of it But I doubt that because I noticed the comment cards in his hands as I was walked out and he was tearing them up Obviously  trying to cover up their backs So stay clear of this place.
I ate there tonight and I can certainly say I was less than happy with the restaurant in general When we walked I'm there was no one to great us So we waited come to find out that we ha to wait because they were understaffed With two maybe three waiters It wasn't a slow night an there were four of us We were sat at a table that had yet to be cleaned When our food came we still had yet to be given silverwareI ordered the stacked enchiladas - red chili With an egg $15 plate Not expensive but I certainly expect a decent mean The red chili was horrible They claim "New Mexico" styled Mexican cuisine I travel to New Mexico often and in comparison I felt like I was eating at just another sheik city Mexican restaurant where the white people who don't know the difference eat I give the restraint the single star because I had a great server an when I told him that the meal was less than satisfactory he had taken the meal off the check.
Terrible experience in Swaddee  I found an used bandage in the food  So yakkk  The waitress came and grabbed the dish away  I should've take a picture about it She apologized for the incident  But my friends and I had to leave  I will never go to the place again.
You know I really wish Gold's Gym staff would stop harassing me with messages hereread my review for why I left I will never ever go to a Gold's Gym again.
Yuck How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food Bummer.
I went there last week for the first time Was pretty excitedmy cherry getting popped and allThe menu board was nice and bigeasy to readThat is the one star place was clean and floors were shinnyA friend of mine was eating there when we went in to order and he said I love this placeI was pretty excited that it would be really good because he is smartI am quite the food snobFYIOMGso we had to tell the gal 3 times the order was to goOur 2 meals were of course cold and I live less than 1/2 a mile awayThe sides 2 beans and green goo- were scary and the guacamole goo some green looking  stuff was from a canMy fish tacos were terrible and the fish was over cookedI will never go againso sorry my smart friend.
I wish I could give this place 0 stars  My god the server really ruined a fun night out for my group  A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab sorry  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab so she let me but not without a couple snarky comments to our table  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning when there was only 4 people to start with  Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down  Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busierRemember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straightagain writing things down would really have helped out  I don't know if the server was new or what but she was disorganized and incredibly rude  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving usisn't a large tab a good thing  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money UNBELIEVABLE  WORST SERVICE EVER.
We are regulars of the Mesa location always enjoy it This visit on Central was really disappointing Party of four stopped last night the margaritas were great Both the red and green salsas were really salty all four commented on that I thought it may be the chips it was the salsa Usually out of town guests comment on the heat but the salt was the noticeable flavor Wife had a chicken burrito Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water Not to be confused with juice it was water My green chili dinner was mediocre The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat The meat had been put on the plate green chili poured over the top The meat was dry nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations Diner three loved the ribs Diner four ate the flautas but said they were bland Typically in Mesa people love the food and comment on the heat In this case one loved his ribs all loved the margaritas Maybe we hit on a bad night but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled These salsas were overwhelming with salt all four of us commented immediately We are pretty easy to please have been eating at Ls Dos for years We will go back to Mesa but not this location There were too many negatives not much on the plus side.
Don't be fooled by their 50% coupon I went in for highlights and walked out paying $72 (after the 50% discount) When I asked why it was so expensive after the discount was applied I was told it only discounted one service I was confused since I only got one service (highlights) but was told  hey charge $20 for a blowdry and $10 for a toner What kind of salon charges an extra $20 for a blow dry Shouldn't that come standard with all services My hair only goes a little past my shoulders and everytime I have ever got highlights the most I have paid was $75 at FULL price I went in thinking I'd end up paying 40 for highlights with my coupon This place charges way too much for their services No wonder I was one of 2 women there on a Saturday when most salons are usually jam packed.
Oh my God Whoever the people are that are giving this place good reviews must be used to eating poop covered dog food Worst tacos I've ever had salad bar seemed like it was set out sometime in the 1970's pretty sure the mashed potatoes were soaked in urine instead of butter and the marinara sauce was cooked in a boot instead of a pot Couldn't wait to get out of there and go brush my teeth GOOD BYE RUBY TUESDAY.
Meh I am not a fan I went here for happy hour one time and I was beyond disappointed They must've had their D list chefs working Cuz my food was GROSS I couldn't even finish it Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.
This place was horrible  The waiters were decent but they brought us the wrong items and gave us a hard time when we wanted the right ones  The pasta was also inedible and when we tried to send it back after they had taken it away they told us if we wanted a replacement dish we would have to pay for both dishes  We asked to talk to the manager who is also the owner  He refused 2 times to talk to us until we relayed that we would be posting a review on Yelp  Then he came over and agreed not to charge us for the wrong meals which had already been removed  Horrible customer service  And we still had to pay for our drinks and they never offered to send us the right food.
the one and only time for me i got food poisoning.
This place could not last in any other major city The service can be appalling The food is basic and very expensive Quite possibly the loudest piano on earth.
Hostess is awkward and not friendly  We ordered jalapeños on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out she just put jabaneros on it and didn't say anything  A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute  Thanks for asking me   Additionally neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it Potato salad was good but served with plastic spoons Garlic fries were soggy Food was acceptable: I would try again Can't speak for the wings.
Stayed here one night went to a seminar and decided to come back  Wasn't terrible for the price  Upon checking back in we realized they didn't change the sheets on the bed because there were some marks on the ones from the previous night that were still there so they were never changed even though we checked out with no intention on coming back  They cut corners here that normally would get missed by customers  This is completely unsanitary and disgusting  We even had to change our own sheets they were delivered to the room from they guy that checked us in the office  There is no housekeeping here.
just got two orders of baked mostacciolli  One was obviously bad by the overwhelming smell when we opened the lid  They offered to send me another order but by now the damage was done  Will not order from here againGood luck.
My buddies back is hurting So I take him here He's never been here before It says walkins welcome It says $1995 for your first adjustment It says open till 4pm Clock says 3:45pm We go in There are no other customers waiting The rude lady behind the desk gives us a dirty look before asking in a not quite friendly tone what we wanted  I indicate my pal needs adjusting This is typically a 5-10 minute procedure A guy who failed to introduce himself comes out from the back and say this exactly: "If you make it worth my while and  join my program I will see you today but if you're just here for the 'one and done' you're gonna have to come back Monday" How about we don't ever come back It wasn't worth my while taking my friend who is in pain all the way down here.
After all the great reviews I thought the food would be great  It wasn't  We both ordered the ribs ith different side orders ( fries beansetc)  The food is greasy   It thrown on a paper plate and served in a sloppy fast food style  We left without eating our plates.
I made the mistake of going to this branch on a Friday at 4:30 pm They had 2 teller windows open and I counted 23 people in line with 4 greeters I had a simple check deposit and I didn't require a receipt I asked 2 of the greeters if they could handle the deposit for me as greeters do at their other branches but was told I would need to stand in line I will not make the same mistake twice and won't be returning to this branch.
I've used Sparklean Laundry for the past two months for wash & fold service The detergent they use smells like wet rat so I had to bring them my own but they still use the in house detergent from time to time They also misplaced the dryer sheets that I had brought in When I questioned the staff about it they shrug it off and play pass the buck I'm a real Yelper with real friends & place real reviews Heads up on this business I'm done.
DO NOT go here Have been going here for 3 years and quality has gone way done Now my diamond ring has been "lost" under some questionable circumstances and they are refusing to help me or look or do anything Don't let this happen to you.
I have never been in such an amazing property and had such a horrible time made arrangements one month in advance for a friend of mine booked it with Erin( if she is not fired yet end the conversation as soon as she gets on the phone)for 20 plus 23- 26yr old women   after waiting out front for 20min Erin cleared the guests to enter she then attempted to pass off a room that had seating reserved for the guest bartenders guests being obviously overbooked she then tried to tell me i was obligated to buy 6 bottom shelf bottles (at a price i am too embarrassed to mention ) and seating for maybe 4  after about 20 more minutes of yelling back and fourth over the music she tried to have the now 20+ guests escorted out birthday girl in tears we moved the party back in to another friends table to try and save the nightstay away lame scene horrible service with so many options in old town this is not where u want to find yourself any night of the weekon top of it the local police have to have at least 3 squad cars parked there all night clearly the staff has no control over the customers that is the last thing i want to walk past when i leave the club with my friends.
I have been trying to get in to have the show dog test done It is hard for me to do so because of my schedule Tonight I was able to get out of work at 7 I went straight to the Tempe location with my running shoes in hand First no one even acknowledged me for about 20 minutes then when I finally do get acknowledged the sales person says that they cannot perform the shoe dog test on me because it was close to closing time and there were two people ahead of me It was 7:30 pm on Feb 162013 I asked if they could make an exception because I had just gotten out of work and didn't know when I would be able to cone back I said I needed the shoes by tomorrow She said " Well we can do a quick analysis"  I told her to forget it I need a good test because I'll be running in a marathon I would've bought 3 pairs of shoes and possibly more running gear and clothes I said forget it I'll go to another store She just smiled and said "Ok" I was VERY disappointed I will take my business elsewhere then Seems the employees were more about getting out of work on time than making money.
I have been going to this MImi's Café on a regular basis for the last 13 years but earlier this week they have completely rearranged the menu and most of my old favorites are gone  The food quality has gone down considerably too  The Cobb Salad used to be great but the last time I was there there were just a few bits of hard boiled egg tomato bacon and blue cheese in what was mostly just a bowl of shredded lettuce  And they charged me $9 for that  The manager who speaks really hard to understand English did not seem to think anything was wrong with that  The fans on their Facebook page are in open revolt and all the Mimi's Café people can say is "change is hard" and that people should try something else on the menu  They don't get it  The burden of persuasion is on them not the customer  Stay away at least until they come to their senses.
I took in my 2006 Kenmore vacuum First know that the repair location is offsite and you will only hear from a call center in some other location $45 (non-refundable) upfront gets you a diagnosis 10 days later It applies to the actual repair The call center contacted my to authorize a new motor and filter but could not answer basic questions about the warranty on the new part I had to call back the next day and get someone else on the line I approved the repair and 10 days later they called to get authorization for a different filter I authorized it and thought they were going to tell me I could pick it up the next day but the filters aren't stocked on site or in the store Odd The employee reminded me that my vacuum was a 2006 and technology changes So now I find out I'm repairing a vacuum that they don't even stock filters for anymore and that it is going to take another 10 days for a filter they didn't notice the first time around - seriously I asked them to throw in the $1995 filter for my time inconvience and their oversight in not providing the information at the time I was trying to decide whether to repair the vacuum or buy a new one They refused I forfeited my $45 and asked for my unrepaired vacuum The whole system is an unfortunate mess and exemplifies the reason Sears has fallen from a respected retailer whose products you used to be able to rely on to a stumbling faltering mess The attitude of both the employee on the phone and the one in the repair center store front was that I was unreasonable to expect Sears to offer anything better in terms of service for a 2006 product People who know me know I like to use and repair recycle and reuse rather dumping everything in the landfill What a waste.
AWFUL I have NEVER received such terrible service in my LIFE I cannot express to you just how important it is for you to go elsewhere I spent $700 on a my sub zero ( which is fine if it were fixed) They had to come out 5 times to even diagnose what was wrong Also they would only give 4 hour chunks of time for when they would service that is WHEN they show up Thats right they just no showed after rearranging our work/kids schedules When giving the owner Donna an opportunity to address the issue it was a joke She took absolutely NO responsibility no remorse in fact she didnt even call me back or respond to voice mails I have never been so insulted and disrespected by a business Very unfortunate.
I would never go to ANY Hooters every again I have been to all locations in the valley and my experiences there have always been horrible Horrible service management is completely rude The servers are always talking to a table of young guys while neglecting other tables Never prebusses the tables so I am forever eating beside empty bowls Also every time I order wings they are ALWAYS BLOODY Talk about gross The girls are not cute and the food is horrible I do not recommend any to go there ever Plenty of other concept restaurants with good food and service Do not go there.
Amazingly disgusting yet mildly charming Odors of all sorts dirt & filth plus sweet sound of pigeons outside my window Spotted: two coke cans circa 1990s in the gutters A gem of a place :).
This used to be Johnson's Cleaners an excellent long standing Phoenix dry cleaner with a knack for repairs I gave the new owners a few tries and it was a disaster Just because something is allegedly "organic" does not mean it's healthy Turned out I am extremely allergic to the chemical or "natural" ingredient in the dry cleaning solvent I broke out in hives up to my face by the time I got to work I have never had a reaction to anything like that before and it took a few weeks before I realized it was the clothes that had been dry cleaned at this shop Since then I've tried to wash the clothes that are washable fabrics (eg linen) and changed to Uptowne Cleaners but I never could wear some clothes ever againSince I changed dry cleaners I haven't had any more hives.
EEEW NO THIS PLACE IS SUPER MEGA TACKY WAY GHETTO When My son was younger (6) he asked me to take him there I did And OMG we both hated it And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible The people that go there are all shady looking I'd say a dangerous crown This place is NO FUN And It's a scary crowd yukky.
I do not believe that this is a good dry cleaners  If you want to find out then go and hopefully you have a better experience  The left a stain on my collared shirt and all of my white collared shirts then cleaned but didn't iron  They were all super wrinkled when I got them back  Some sort of weird joke.
Is there a Zero Star  Awesome a BEER garden in downtown Tempe  Sign me up  We get the menu and they have a decent selection of good craft beers  Awesome againThere are 6 of us at the table this night (Saturday prior to this review) and out of the 6 beers we order they are out of 4  Ummm THUD  Oh let me rephrase they were out of 5 cause when they brought one of the beers they said they had they really didn't have it and changed his order to a Kiltlifter without asking  THUD againHow does a beer garden on a Saturday night not have beerOnto the food  I love sausages and they have 4 of them on the menu I think two or three burgers and a few salads  Like 7 items total  So a brat and beer sounded good  Ohwere out of all sausage  THUDEnough for me7 menu items out of 4 beer garden out of at least 5 beers on tap (could have been more who knows) tells me all I need to knowBuh bye.
I've ordered carry out pizza at least a dozen times from this place  It has always been pretty good especially the crust  Tonight they screwed up the order which I didn't realize until I got home  When I called to let them know I was told the only way to make it right was for me to come back in for another pizza tonight  A guy that I assume is the manager told me he made what I ordered (not possible) they don't give credit and apparently just to be a smart ass told me they have buy on get one free on Monday but not today  I told him I won't be coming back and he said "OK fine".
First warning would be that any rest that is completely empty at 7:30pm on a Thursday means the food is not good The service was great but the food was a miss I paid $19 for the 'short ribs' which actually was 4 tiny slices of overcooked meat The rest of my party's dinner seemed average at best The biggest problem is that my credit card was charged twiceI spoke with Eric the manager once after it happened but to date no credit back I would have been willing to pay for the meal but I don't want to pay for that now either I guess they need to get $ however they can.
delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there my flight out of PVD was delayed sat on the runway for a good 20mins when we arrived in ATL they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another 20mins for my luggage these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to PHX none of the delta representatives and managers cared there were no more flights out to PHX that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations and/or a meal voucher so i was stuck in the ATL airport overnight seriously one of the worst experiences EVER and i fly a lot 0* if i could.
I was given a prepaid detail as a gift I made my appointment took my White truck to be detailed They called me a few hours later and said it was ready to be picked up I inspected my truck when I got home I only live a mile from this location my truck looked horrible Wheel wells-not cleaned(still had dirt in them) bed of the truck-not clean(still had dirt in it) tires-looked terrible due to whatever the slime was that they sprayed on them interior- don't even think it got vacuumed(found a peanut and white dog hair I have a black dog that I do not let ride in my truck) they left spots on my floormats from where they cleaned one spot(didn't clean the entire mat) my dash was covered in that nasty slime & my rearview mirror and visor mirror still had fingerprints on them All that isn't the worst part the thing that made this a horrible place to get a detail is that they had actually managed to Swirl a WHITE truck How do you swirl a white truck I would hate to see what they would have done had I taken in a dark colored vehicle I even found bugs on the front of my truck I only live a mile away I couldn't have gotten that many bugs from the drive home I won't even go back for a carwash I'm not sure how much was paid for my detail but I do know that the person that paid for it got robbed.
I would give this place 0 stars if I couldWe went on a saturday afternoon for a quick bite We walked into the bar where we were the only people on sitting on high tops Our server came in and asked us what we wanted to drink we put in our food order at the same time At 10 mins in people are sitting down and ordering Our server is bringing out food left and right he tells us our food "will be right out" About 25 minutes later several people are now sitting at the bar high tops and some of them are eating and a couple of guys who sat down after us were already finished with their meal We call our server over and tell him that people who sat down after are already finished with their meal he says "Oh don't worry your food will be right out" An indication that he was clearly incompetent was when he put in a food order after ours and is  bringing it out before ours We tell him that we would need our food to to go because we had places to be About 10 minutes later the manager comes out (with no food in hand) and says that they must have lost our ticket in the back and he will go back there and see what's going on At this point we can't tolerate anymore incompetence so we leave hungry after waiting over 45 mins This location is the worst service I've experienced Even a hefty gift card couldn't make up for this awful experience.
Room 123 is supposed to be a non-smoking room however there was a lingering stench of cigarette smoke and cigarette burns in the comforter and the chair Internet access painfully slow The bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in The toilet consistently ran all night None of the most basic amenities in the room upon arrival such as shampoo conditioner lotion coffee packets etc TV remote took a lot of figuring out on how to switch over from cable to the DVD player Perhaps because I'm a director of food and beverage for a large hotel I'm overly-picky but overall I was very underwhelmed by my stay not a 2-star quality hotel in my view --- Ending on a positive note front desk staff was very welcoming and accomodating.
Disgusting Don't expect customer service Don't expect employees to stop their personal conversations with each otherDon't expect employees to look you in the eye as you are paying for an item Don't expect employees to have manners not even the most basic mannersDo expect to have employees ignore you as you are paying for an item at the registerExpect employees to stand in an isle yelling rules that will never pertain to a self respecting customerGoing to Last Chance would be less painful if the employees had an ounce of class  Buying a used $600 purse is already a cockamamie idea But to have the sales person be outright rude to you as you pay for that bag or any other item for that manner is just beyond ridiculous Used crap is clearly worth much less than new merchandise Last Chance should be so lucky to accept money for the used crap people return to Nordstrom After my terrible experience at Last Chance I would rather save my money and deal with polite and classy sales people to purchase necessary items at a higher priceNordstrom I am very disappointed in you Your employees should provide the same level of customer service at all locations that represent the Nordstrom name.
I am disappointed  I wanted to like this place  My husband and I decided to give this place a try  Big mistake  What a waste of a "date night"  It was very busy so we decided to sit at the bar  Not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction  My husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair  What did this girl do  Nothing lifted her head and asked "did I hit you" my response was "I think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him"  Under her breath she said "sorry" and turned around to take care of other people  I asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons because I might be missing something  Eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks  The sushi is not great is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything  There are better places for sushi.
We discovered "Blu Burger" because my son's soccer team was having a fundraiser there We went with my parents-in-lawIt was horrible First my son asked for a glass of water and the waiter said "Wait a sec I need to go get these people"  and he ran to a different table when we weren't done ordering Then we confront the manager and he says "Well it's busy" and walks off Next to the food Half of our orders came wrong and we had to be charged for their mistake The burgers were cold and tasted like frozen patties Not going there EVER.
I rcvd a fantastic car wash at this business  Spent 30 bucks thought was a lil high but turned out to be one of the best car washes I ever hadBUT I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN I have arthritis in both shoulders and use pain pills mostly at bed time to control the pain  I had my small bottle that I keep in the SUV just in case  And my script bottle that I brought with me as I am traveling and staying at a hotel I know the pills were there cause I checked twice on the way to Phoenix I kept them in the middle console Last night when I was done working I reached in and found no pain pills They left the allergy pills thank goodness but my night in bed was sleepless.
I had a problem with a coolant leak on the top of my 2008 Ford Expedition engine  I had had my AC repaired a year earlier at this shop without concern so I when to Greulich's on Ray Road again to have them provide me with an estimate to repair the coolant leakI arrived about 4 PM on a Weds and explained the problem  With little discussion the Service Writer (Kelly15) took my keys to have a mechanic "take a look"  There was no discussion about any fees to get an estimateAbout 45 minutes later I was presented with an estimate of $155893 to have a couple hoses replace and to remove and replace the engine intake manifold  I was dumbfounded because it was obvious that the hose was leaking at some of the manufacturing joints and spraying down on the engine  I challenged the Service Writer and said I didn't think the manifold was the problem  He assured me that his "Master Certified" mechanic confirmed the need of manifold replacementIn disbelief I said that I would have to have another garage provide me with an estimate before proceeding at which time I was asked to pay $5850 plus tax for the mechanic's time  Bull S I was never advised that an "estimate" came with a $5850 shop bill  With a firm (read LOUD) voice I said "I'm not paying your bill" and my vehicle was returned to meLong story short I purchased the replacement hose assembly from a retail automotive store and the necessary antifreeze to replace the hose  After 200 miles I observe no additional leakage  Total repair cost in parts was $13995 and a couple of hours of my time  Total SAVINGS to me $141898  It goes without a second thought that I will not be using Greulich's services and will have reason to tell others why I have reached my decision.
Took my parents who are in from Ohio CR back there is good food & a good time However CR Tempe isn't It was Friday night but very slow so that should have been a red flag Five of us went for dinner Only one meal was rated OK the rest were horrible Burgers were dry & tasteless Chicken wings undercooked and virtually sauceless Waitress was slow & wasn't knowledgeable about menu questions The pretzel with dipping cheese appetizers were great but that wasn't enough to up the stars The manager did come to the table about undercooked wings but he had an arrogant attitude leaning into my moms face & saying "so what's your problem with the wings" While at the table he was also hugging the waitress while she was hanging on him Not at all professional Choose another place if you want good food & good service.
Well you expect some kind of hospitality when you are in a restaurant making you feel at ease Delhi Palace does not have it in them In general the servers sound rude and they don't look happy to serve you As far as the food is concerned it is not what you expect from an Indian restaurant The curries were a bit bland and were very thin for an Indian curry Naan was pretty good All in all that was the first time I went to Delhi Palace and it turned out to be the last one.
Very overrated Our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful Overall a bad experience.
This place sucks Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill We won't be back.
Don't come here if you have curly hair The hairdresser I had didn't have a clue how to cut it For example she used a razor (which you're definitely supposed to do with curly hair) To be fair she is getting her real estate license Hopefully she leaves hair cutting soon and never returns  And let's all hope she is better at selling houses.
Very poor integrity in busines practices I moved to Tempe from another state to start school at ASU and had sent my application with fee--and was told I had an apartment waiting for my arrival in two days When I arrived the apartment had been rented to someone else and my application fee was not refunded No explanation or apology--and they had my contact information.
Much to our chagrin this location is now CLOSED Drove from SE Gilbert for chili omelette so disappointedAt least the other locations are apparently staying open Guess we'll have to go to Tempe next time we have a craving.
Went here on two separate occasions once for dinner once for drinks Horrible I'll start with dinner Horrible excuse for Mexican food My husband who loves Mexican wouldn't even finish his burrito and my enchiladas were also gross The food had little flavor and the enchilada sauce was terrible For drinks we went with some friends Our friends ordered a couple of drinks and we bought a round for them We felt as though we were double charged Our waitress brought the manager over and he refused to let us dispute the charge He kicked all of us out and had our check brought outside to us They lost 4 customers for good who typically spend a lot of money over $10 worth of drinks.
I drove from Prescott to try this place  I was going to be in Phoenix that day and needed to try something other than my usual DDD place Chino Bandido  Let me start by saying that I love Guy's suggestions for the most part  Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent  Everything Guy described and more  The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix it's just as he described  I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD  It's slightly better than Los Taquitos  First off Los Taquitos had no fountain soda it was out of order I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable  The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe  My husband ordered the relleno plate  My taco shells were burnt  His relleno was soggy  The only good part was the rice and beans  I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either  The bathroom was pretty bad too  The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with tp Don't get me wrong I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos  I felt ripped off and regret going.
I went here on satuday the 19th I went to purchase a lap top and was ready to buy that day As I was lookin at the different computer the employees we walkin around askin everyone if they needed help everyone but me that is As all the customers we helped and left I was there for 20 minutes with out even being acknowlaged as the workers stood there having a personal conversation This blatent dissregard of my presence caused me to leave with out anything Best buy will no longer have me as a customer and I will buy my electronics else where.
Looking through the photos that were uploaded for this particular Crapmart you can't help but notice that some woman uploaded a photo of herself wearing gaudy brightly colored make-up that looked like it'd been applied with a trowel  And looking at her Yelp account you'll notice that she doesn't actually write reviews she just uploads photos of herself in various ghetto poses to random businesses  Have you ever noticed that on the side of all photographs Yelp always asks if the photo is:Very HelpfulHelpfulNot HelpfulYeah I looked at this photograph and it suddenly occured to me that it was actually VERY helpful in describing this particular WalMart  In fact it should probably be THE storefront photoSo I clicked VERY helpful and that's when I noticed that at least 2 other people also thought the same thing and had voted that photograph very helpful  There you go folks  That photo says it all.
Absolutely horrible place Snakes was treated like pieces of shit and we WILL NOT stand for it The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not as long as he gets his money Completely unprofessional and neither myself or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again.
Eeewww Skip this place The food is gross- no seasoning on anything I got a pasta dish - so bland and pointless to eat My boyfriend got a burger that was way overcooked and the bun was too large to even eat with the meat Garlic bread was way spicy (why I don't know Wouldn't expect that to have a kick but my mouth was on fire) I got house wine to drink which seemed like it had been uncorked for a month so the next glass I upgraded which was a bad idea because I could only take a sip of because it was so gross Never again.
Ok let me just say for a VERY thin crust pizza to start not good at all very disappointed  with is place We waited over a hour for our pizza and it was very bland I from Chicago and have worked at many authentic pizzerias so I'd like to think I have a good pizza perspective I do not recommend  this place and if you are from the east side or Midwest you will not like it I will never come here again Paid 50$ for poor service and poor food You would think in such a prime and up coming location it would be outstanding.
Let me start by saying I love these candles and think the smells are truly unique I have never visited a store because I usually buy online I decided to go to the store today though to smell the holiday scents in person   On this particular trip I had a coupon for buy 2 small jar candles get 2 free I had never purchased the small jar candles so I asked the woman behind the counter to point out which coupons pertain to this promotion She showed me the small jar candle and proceeded to tell me that this was not a good deal She told me the large candle was the best deal and that the small jar candle wasn't a good price  While I can appreciate her desire to up sale I don't appreciate needing to explain that while I agree with her I am not in the position to spend that much money today I was perfectly happy with buying the 2 smaller candles and getting 2 free I realize the best value is the large jar candles (which I had a coupon for buy 2 get 2 free also) I just couldn't spend that much money today  The trip continued to take a turn for the worst when  I went to check out We had about 5 people in line which wasn't a problem until the computer broke We then spent over 10 minutes listening to the same associate announce that this is not her fault and she can't do anything to fix it If we wanted our candles we would just have to wait Finally she has the machine back up and running She begins to ring everyone up She however is taking the time to comment on how she feels about each and every scent that she rings up After spending more then 25 minutes total in line I had to walk out with no candles You see I was on my lunch hour and didn't have the luxury of waiting 25 minutes to have my basket rang up  So now after spending my entire lunch hour in the store discussing my inability to afford 2 large jar candles at that time waiting in line for the cashier to approve every ones candle choices and hearing how she can't do anything about the computer I left with no candles This was my first experience in a Yankee Candle store and let me be honest it STUNK and it wasn't the candles fault.
Gave Ra two chances  Still do not like the atmosphere nor the food  What's with the loud music  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums  The noodle soup the title of which goes something like $14 bowl of soup (I don't know it was so noisy I couldn't think) was TERRIBLE  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace  Total waste of money  Mom didn't like the soup as well  A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps which I do admit were nicely priced  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return however  The one plate I remember liking so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto but they didn't know what it could be much less replicate it  Since I'm not much of a drinker I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my caloriesSayona-Ra.
so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145 it was so slow maybe 15 people in the whole place we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said "its out of my hands" i ask for a manager he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us she said well what do you want to do get your food and go or just go she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says "hey thanks guys" WHAT She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation had no realization at all for customer service none i know we will never ever go back here again oh yeah and when we went to eat the food the order was wrong ridiculous worst sushi place ever.
My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two Also no waters were given to us until requested I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good until I started actually eating it the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage gross The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure the bill came and $199 for sour cream and $250 for guacamole Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before I do not recommend this place to ANYONE unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service friendly atmosphere and good food.
Stood outside the store at 7pm the other night while the employees stood there and looked at me from inside Granted they close  at 7 but a little acknowledgement is what keeps customers I had called before 7 and no one answered so I ran over to exchange my box Cox it's a competitive market out there Maybe the other cheaper services out there won't be so arrogant.
Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun You immediately think good food is aheadThe foodnot so great The food was very bland The chips did not seem homemade The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had Don't pay extra to try any of the salsasblehThe service was horrible The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong I am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good We had tacos quesadillas beans/rice and tried various salsas If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona this isn't the place for you The food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced I will not go back to this place.
Fez Burger was just ok garlic fries were terrible and a $3 up charge Everything seemed store bought from the bread to the patties to the fries.
I sat for 8 minutes without being greeted by the waiter no drinks were offered I left after expressing my dissatisfaction to the hostess Thanks for the terrible service.
My boyfriend and I were looking to switch things up for breakfast this past Sunday We'd passed by BLD a few times before and thought we'd give it a try The atmosphere is hip enough and it seemed pretty decently busy My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy while I ordered the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs wheat toast bacon and I ordered a pancake instead of the breakfast potatoes First time around my eggs were cold Very cold I informed my waitress who had them remade for me Honestly I would rather eat eggs from Denny's than eggs from BLD They were watery and flavorless no matter how much salt and pepper I added The toast came buttered but with no jam or jelly brought to the table Bacon was fine as it's pretty hard to mess up bacon The pancake was large but really just sort of "meh" Nothing too terribly exciting As for the biscuits and gravy the entire dish reeked of onion The onion flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered any other flavors that could have been present Finding his dish inedible we left having eaten between us a piece of toast half a pancake and bacon Perhaps the food for lunch and dinner is better but I don't think neither my boyfriend of myself care to find out Overall the atmosphere is nice but the food was awful We won't be returning.
This is a review for the Nationwide on FLW Blvd in Scottsdale  Long story short I have been wearing contacts for 30 yrs  Went in May of 2013 for an eye exam where I spent almost 1K for both glasses and multifocal contact lenses  They did my eye exam and I actually had a great fit and was very happy with my AirOptix mulit focal  I did not go back to make sure the fitting was right as I am extremely busy and did not know it was mandatory to go back within 90 days  I thought I had 90 days to make sure if they weren't right I only had that long  Nobody stressed that they would not allow me to order more contacts if I did not go back  I have been wearing contacts for 30 yrs and know when I have a good fit  5 months later I have an eye infection that I needed to make an appt for so obviously a charge for that  Well I informed them before my appt that I would like a sample as I just opened my last contacts and I cant wear them again because of this infection  I said I will need to order some at the same time  They refused to order more contacts and said I needed a whole new exam since I didn't come back for my follow up  I said my perscription should be good for 1 yr and it has only been 5 months  Basically they said too bad I have to have another full exam just to get a new perscription  They said I was lucky that they give more than a month  I have never heard of this  This is a way to get more money for another exam  I will never go to any Nationwide vision again after that  I am on a budget so to come up with another $125 or $150 just to get the exact same perscription that I just got from them 5 months ago is ridiculous  They just lost a customer for life  They might want to make it clear to their patients that if they don't come back in 90 days they will not get to order any more contacts for the year  Its just crazy.
I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for BURGERSIt was suppose to be this great place to have burgers we get there to find only three burgers on the menu kind of a let down And they weren't anything special Not to mention it was very dark inside The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets.
Stay as far away from this place as possibleI went here against my will I am surprised that I am still alive Family members suggested eating here  after going to the mall Big HUGE mistake I am not sure what was worsethe food or the employees Both looked grossed as hell I stuck to foods that temperature was not an issuelike pizza and bread This place was filthyeverywhere and the food was nasty looking.
We were in town visiting the outlet stores and decided to stop after seeing the yelp reviews We ordered for six and were surprised when everyone noticed something a little off on the food  All the refried beans had a very strong sour taste like vinegar We told the girl working there and she confirmed that the beans had soured At first she told us it was lime juice in the beans She went and talked to the owner and they threw the beans out By this time everyone was worried about getting sick The girl tried refunding only the equivalent of what the beans would cost I reminded her that there were also beans inside the burritos and in the nachos The owner actually refunded our money and we left  His explanation I've been doing this since 1991 and sometimes things happen  It might be that the beans were bad when we got them Maybe a "sorry about that" would have been better  Too bad because the part we did eat before the spoiled beans was pretty good.
I would rate less if given chance I purchased a deal on living socialCom for yard-work First I contacted them by email and after 2 days no response I figured they must be busy well after 4 days had to call them I ended speaking with Michael the owner On first impression he seemed like a good guyBut from the get go you can tell he is in over his head He doesn't keep you informed and after first contact you end up chasing him to get anything from info on appt or what is needed to just speaking with him Now after scheduling was made he couldn't make first appt And had to reschedule so by that point I figured I could help him out and just leave dogs inside with side gate unlocked while I wasn't home Fine with me Anyway asked him to try and see if sprinklers could be replaced Well for the sake of my thumb I will just end this with saying that when I looked at yard once DruWest was gone Grass was scalped whoever had hold of weed-eater needs to chill on caffeine whomever had hold of trimmer for bushes should have used it and whomever had weed kill spray should have stood up and used it instead of letting it just try to spray itself Oh ya About those sprinklers I asked about Never were touched AND TO TOP IT OFF NEVER EVEN CONTACTED ME TO TELL ME WHAT HE DID OR DIDNT DO PATHETIC NEVER AGAIN.
This is what they think of African Americans a friend forwarded this message to me from the owner David I cant copy and paste message but he think black people are not educated and all are thieves and need to be put in there place from time to time by Armenian people i can forward message if you really want to see it.
My wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely  This kind of customer service (or lack thereof) is simply inexcusable for any business establishment  I advise you to go elsewhere for your tailoring needs.
This was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed Our "Non smoking" room reeked of cigarettes the TV had one channel the bed had NO blankets and it was incredibly noisy with what I suspect are drug addicts coming and going all night long The curtains in the room were 2 different lengths on the same window and I wouldn't walk barefoot on the carpet We paid $70 to stay at this dump Never again will I stay at any Travelodge Everything I brought into the room smelled and had to be washed If I hadn't been so tired after driving for hours I would have stayed elsewhere.
They've moved Thanks for the heads up.
Disappointing I have been to two other TK's (Scottsdale and Tempe) and had a better experience at both First off the soda mix was messed up Now I can get over this because that is the way these things work You usually have little to no warning when the mix goes bad but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get me a new drink The sandwich was not good eitherthe French/ Irish dip was totally bland The au jus had a little flavor which helped me choke it down but I'd never order it again Our waitress was nice even though she was completely overwhelmed but a couple of the other servers looked downright pissed off and mean This establishment will probably be very profitable because of its location within CityScape The alcohol sales alone will probably be enough to keep it in the black If I ever go back it will be for adult beverages only I'd rather get a hot dog at Chase or US AirwaysAt least the boobies are fun to look at.

**WARNING** do not eat here  Had a birthday dinner here last nightTerrible experienceI will be balanced hereif you want to sit on the patio with friends people watch and have drinks this is a good choiceThe wine list is good with reasonable prices no extreme markup  Now the badService What service Our server was beyond clueless  Their corn bread was mushy and coldwhen we pointed it out to the server said she knows everyone complains about it  When asked for just plain bread she brings out a basket with 3 pieces for 4 people  When we point this out we never get anymore bread I am not joking hereI would have left if I could but as we were out with another couple for the wifes birthday I had to gut it out  They also keep their wine downstairs somewhere(swing for a wine fridge will you) and we picked the one bottle they couldn't find  You say talk to a managerwell we sure did Mr Robert Rogers came over to say how sorry he was and how things would be great from then on Yet another empty promise as water glasses go unfilled and coffee wasn't even offered as the server just brought the check  I saw other guests getting french pressed coffee why not us I guess you don't even get a choice about desert and coffee anymore The room acoustics are terribleA DJ  why Is it a club or a place to eat  It is very loud & there is no dance floor Bathrooms are disgusting(the ladies had to tell Robert Rogers the manager there was no toilet paper UGH) This place tries really hard to be cool and fails in a big wayFred Unger please close this mistake down asapI expected much more from Unger who was responsible for Lon's and Royal Palms but then again Lon's was always hit and miss  revolving chefs and menus Again DO NOT EAT HERE Go else where.
I never thought any fast food (outside of In N Out) would get more than 4 stars Besides the fact that their food tastes like roadkill I'm still amazed Only in Phoenix.
The pizza: total bullocks Tasteless crust is gross toppings are suspect Pasta: not great tastes like it is all from a can WAY too pricey baked zitti will cost $750 for a pretty small amount Give me a break Sandwiches: CRAP I mean really bad Bread is nasty and the meats are sub-par Veggies are nasty as wellBreakfast burritos: actually really good.
I've had lunch here three times now  The first couple times I would have given it three stars but the third time is definitely NOT a charm  I'm giving it one star based on the completely inedible BBQ chicken and long wait  This must be the leftover s*** chicken that no other restaurant wanted to purchase   For a completely fattening cholesterol laden meal I would like to enjoy SOME level of flavor other than lard  I calcuated the approximate number of calories (based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu) for a Chicken Katsu "plate lunch" to be a whopping 1800 calories (1200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni "salad" and one scoop of rice)  Gross.
My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba with fewer meat choices (no carnitas) The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixingsIt was a long look as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me After a long while one gal pointed me out to another who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill At this point I gave up and leftThe idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chanceI went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there.
I am posting the following from my wife:Over the past 5 years I have been a patient of Dr Garza and had referred many friends and we were all very happy at first  I am not sure what happened in the last couple of years but at the very least we have all been very disappointed  Dr Garza removed sealants which promptly became cavities mis-billed causing patients to be over charged and at one point did a root canal leaving shards of tooth behind He said he knew it was there on the x-ray then saying it would not be a problem  I then went on vacation and ended up with an abscess so bad that I had to have emergency oral surgery with no anesthetic because there was too much swelling  These emergency services had to be paid in cash because we were out of network and had to see an emergency dentist  8 out of the 10 days of our vacation were ruined because Dr Garza chose to take a chance things would be ok instead of doing the right thing and removing the shard  A few months later I receive a bill for that extraction as it was not covered because he had worked on it before  I called and spoke to the new billing person and was told not to worry about it and so I didn't  Now we find out it was sent to collections   Absolutely the worst patient care I have ever had  Not one of the six families I had referred still sees him  On every dental insurance website he has been flagged with some unusual code He routinely charges extra for services that would be covered by in network dentists There was always some "special" case for billing extra and the excuses just got way to tiring Dr Garza is not a place I would suggest anyone to go.
Reg at the Scottsdale one  1st time here rude service Wanna be hipsters that play to cool for school work here and food isn't as good as Scottsdale location  Never will go back always pass it up on that side of town.
I went to dinner here on 10/28/2010 What attracted me was the reputation the restaurant had for it's authentic food and the Mariachi Trio music on Thursday night  What a disappointment it was  The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers  There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough definitely not top sirloinWe were also served chips and salsa  which were OK nothing specialSince we were still hungry after eating the fajitas we ordered sopapillasThey came out and again what a disappointment Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists(who will never come back) and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like.
This place never answers it phones So unprofessional Ugh big mistake I'm taking my business to 4 wheel parts performance center.
I have used this shop for a few years but I have to admit I am not happy with their service right now I had a Hayward vacuum that they fixed twice under warranty and the same thing broke again - instead of perhaps considering I just got a bad vacuum I was told I had excessive use Really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much  I don't run it 24/7 its a small play pool and the vacuum is less than 2 years old  Now they want me to pay over $200 and to be honest they weren't very nice about it either  I don't think I will go back here.
I visited this store after purchasing the Groupon 4pack and my kids loved it so no complaints initially Until I came back and tried to redeem two Groupons on separate transactions which I was allowed to do on first visit I was told the owner decided you could only redeem one per visit which was not in the deal fine print This was unfortunate since I brought a whole pack of kids Left a bad taste in my mouth and we won't be going back in an effort to force repeat visits they lost customers.
Overall the food is amazing and very reasonable price during the lunch time However I was very disappoint it at the end I saw a lady order a drink for to go She drink it and found out it was wrong order They made the new the order for you When she left the owner put the drink back to original jars and serve for next customer I am shock and very disappointed about it.
Don't go here for your banking Their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent I wanted to get away from the big banks because I'd heard that the smaller banks like credit unions were better So far they are no better In fact the customer service at Bank of America was WAY better at least I could get a live person whenever I needed it Reaching a live person at the credit union is next to impossible in my experience My impression is that they prefer that you either take care of what you need through their automated system or use email which sometimes just doesn't cut it Their response time is like molasses Another thing to beware of is fees You must read the fine print I didn't know that I would be charged a $10 per month fee if I didn't sign up for their E-statement program Basically they are charging you $10 per month for a paper statement Last I knew stamps cost 50 cents and a sheet of paper maybe 5 cents I don't know what kind of labor goes into printing and automatically sending a statement once per month but I do know it doesn't cost $10 since everything is automated these days  Also beware of their Popmoney fee I tried using the service without success and was forced to cancel the transaction Lo and behold the next day I was slapped with a $32 fee (it looks like they were treating it as a stop payment on a check) Nowhere was there anything posted about this exorbitant fee And again I ask why does a fee need to be leveraged when everything is run by computer It just seems greedy to meIn closing I would like to say that this credit union is making me regret my decision to leave BofA At least BofA as long as I fulfilled my contractual obligations for the account (ie kept a balance or used direct deposit) never charged me any feesMoral of the story: Research banks before you leave one and join another Hopefully my review will help you make the right decision.
Worst green curry I have ever had The chicken and vegetables in the curry were good and fresh but the actual curry aSauce was awful It said it was made with coconut milk but I'm thinking more like coconut water or maybe just plain water It was runny and flavorless But the spring roll that came with the lunch was good.
Lordy I really hate this place I'm using the word "hate" about a restaurantI really want to have a good time here I have friends and co-workers that go here all the time Mike loyalty is a virtue and I respect that I'll never get what you see in this restaurant though It all looks so promising Good location busy professionals bustling in and out free wifi The microcosm all shatters after thatFirst off as another reviewer mentioned the line is straight out of junior high You walk over grab a tray and then proceed to an utterly befuddling system of pre-made food people making food people waiting for pre-made and yet-to-be-made food What the heck is going on in this line I want a half sandwich and cup of soup They have no sandwiches made so they give me a giant number on a metal pole I proceed to the logjam of people waiting for custom salads to be made Do I go around them to get my soup Do I wait Some people seem to be waiting Someone asks me if I need soup I open my mouth and manage "I---" when a lady behind me shouts "Cup of lemon chicken orzo" Oh you You know the lady Smart ponytail pointy nose voice that destroys and overrides every other sonic frequencyOh people cut me YES Junior high People are taking cutsies for the love of Pete People in skirts and people in ties I realize that I've gone to the same place for lunch as salespeople and HR representatives who drive black Hummers and black Yukons with black Cardinals license plates flicking cigarettes out the windows and failing to signal lane changes as they go And they're cutting me in line How did my judgment get so cloudedNow someone hands me my sandwich and takes back my giant number I am now at the cashier Another bottleneck The people here have no money handling skills--they are handed legal tender and they inspect it as if someone gave them kroner and they're mentally performing a currency conversion Five more minutes go by and my toes are getting numb from standing in line Do I have a (mumble) card No no Whatever it is I don't have it and I don't want it I'll never be back hereI get to the drink station and more people cut me as I try to set my tray down and get tea I realize I overshot the silverware and try to step back that way Someone heads me off at the pass and takes the last FOUR soup spoonsI finally sit down and attempt to enjoy a few minutes of solitude I'm in the north room After 70 seconds a woman asks me if I'd like to try some Thai salad I decline and hear card shuffling I'm not in a dining room I'm in a card room Women are playing bridge or rummy or cribbage and they are laughing raucously The uniquely annoying sounds of metal-footed chairs being drug across a tile floor reverberate through my eardrums as other women prepare to turn the room into a mahjong parlor One of them dumps a whole box of mahjong tiles on a comically small table and they laugh as the tiles tinkle to the floorSomewhere next to me a guy's giant number on a metal pole tips over and clangs to the floor Someone asks him if he's seen a set of Yukon keys.
I hate how I am forced to give this location a star they don't even deserve that honestly If I had to explain this location is a simple phrase it would be "bad customer service" I walked into this location to pick up a Dr Brown "y" nipple for a bottle I purchased at this location previously I waited for the only person on the sales floor to free up for 20 minutes The associate seemed to ignore the fact that I was waiting for help After running out of patience having the sales rep ignore my need for help and finding the product was not on the shelf myself I figured I would see if they could check back stock at customer service I timed my wait in line because the poor service I have received in the past I was the only person in line and waited 11 minutes before I was contacted by an associate to assist me During that period the manager was talking to an angry customer on the phone both checkout lines were at a stand-still waiting for the manager for assistance and I still had not been contacted Finally one of the waiting associates paged the sales associate to the customer service desk to assist me I asked if they had back stock of the Dr Brown "y" nipple the associate simply stated "no we are out until Tuesday's truck They might come in then" Overall I waited half an hour to be told they didn't have it and receive a maybe we will get it Tuesday answer No offer to check other locations purchase the item online or even an alternative I hope this store goes out of business I would even take a RadioShack in its place At least they have batteries that are priced reasonably.
To sum this whole paragragh up"BAR" = DUMP WIFE = SKANKY LESBIAN RUDE BIOTCH Bands suck the most sober gets everyone else kicked outnever happens Cheap for a reason thats the only way they get the money Spend more get betterThis "Bar" is a dump The owner's wife is an idiot She's running this bar to the ground If you want to have a good night forget going to this bar you'll get nothing but a horriable nightmare It's not even a biker barmaybe if your 60 or older but under the age of 35 don't go This is a warning We went one about a month ago and the owner's wife drunk as hell and start's yelling at my wife check this out through the cracks of the bathroom stall telling her not to use all her toilet paper So we decided we wouldn't go there again then again we decide it's very dirt cheap so lets go back well last night we did what dumb mistake We start there with an old crappy band and then decide lets play pool put 75 cents in the machine one ball is missing can't play with one ball missing so we decide oh well lets just play take away the other color ball we start playing and all the balls got stuck and the pool sticks had no tips we had to share a stick When we decided to complain that we couldn't play anymore because the table was broken 1st she decides to say it's not broken I just got this fixedwell we didn't break it so idiot someone did While she's away one of my friends decided to get the balls off the table and "punches the balls" she comes out yelling it costed her $600 to get it fixed and was making a big deal over the balls even though thats the whole point your supposed to hit the ballswith a crappy stick She yells at my friends then comes to me and my wife even though were no where near her and starts yelling at my wife through me She says everytime you guys come here theres a problemand includes when you left last time you left trashoh I'm sorry forgot this was a prissy bar where the owner is LAZY doesn't want to do her job or pay for itbut she can "FIX" a pool table I said what and she keeps going then decides to call me a drunkwhen she's the worse person in the whole bar and I was the DD how the hell was I drunk Then she keeps going when I'm clearly ignoring her so finally I asked why she was still talking to shut up and she said don't tell me to shut up I told her it's okay you just lost $100+ a night from us so thats fine you'll never see us again so she decides because were leaving to say you guys are 86'ed really Because your drunk ass can't handle the sitiuation She ruin's everyone's night even the person that is not saying anythingShe's an old lesbian even though she claimed she's been faithful for 4 years and then asked my wife if she's jealous that she's making out with other woman on the pool tablesthat she's mad about I mind youbut she's "faithful" my ass To finish and sum it up I'd rather pay $6 a beer at the expensive bar's then go here ever again.
I ordered our food online  I came there to pick it up  Nobody even asked me anything I had to go and ask for help  I finally got my food  Came back to the office  I started to eat my food and bit in to some weir plastic I started to look through my food and I found about 6 more pieces of Plastic  I called to speak to a manager on duty I told him what happened and he said I am sorry I do not know how plastic into your food  He assured me that he will credit my card and will send me a gift card so I can come back to the restaurant because he said he doesnt want to loose a customer  It has been a month and my card has not been credited and I never received a gift card  So if you want to go to a restaurant and choke on a plastic as I did do go to Genghis Grill in North Scottsdale  The people that work there they can care less about what happens to you.
The food here might be good I don't know we weren't allowed to stay I showed up with my family of 5 at 8:30 We walked to the counter where the girl informed us they were only serving orders to go I said "the sign says you're open 'till 9" She said that yes they were but once our food came out it would only leave us about 5 minutes to eat So wait let me get this straightFirst it takes 25 mins to make a few teriyaki bowlsSecond as far as I know if we enter an establishment during hours of operation we should be able to sit down and eatThird you want me to take my family of 5 including a 3 year old and a baby outside to eat in the car so you can close your doors at 9 on the dotGive me a break.
Appointment was at 11:15 and it took over an hour to see the eye Dr for the eye exam The Dr was nice but when it came time to pay for the frames the two pair deal they advertised for $69 with a free eye exam turned into $200 I didn't even pick out special frames they were the basic ones that went with their advertised special However I did opt to get the basic plastic lenses with glare resistance which is an extra $60 At the most I expected to pay around $140 but definitely not $200 What they don't tell you is that the basic plastic lenses are an extra $60 as well When I asked the lady any questions about pricing she just looked at me but didn't respond She basically had a it is what it is look on her face Ugh Just ugh awful experience I don't recommend them Go to lens crafters at the mall instead because atleast they have nicer frames for that price.
This place is so awful that I don't even want to spend too much time writing this reviewFood is mediocre service was extremely rude my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing ithuh  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dishthat was itwould never ever go back.
This place is always hit or miss but every time I order hummus the server thumbs up the pitas His big dirty thumb right on top of all the pita breads You see the guy coming in and out of the front door a hundred times an hour thats ben touched by every person in the restaurant Just seems like a good way to cross contaminate the food during flu season Is it me or does the salad always have slimy greens and crappy tomatoes Suggestion tell your servers to keep their dirty paws out of my food.
Doctors are Great- and have been for my kids for the Past 25 Years BUT the STAFF IS not only Incompetent- Now Days But also LIARS and I withdrew my son from being a patient there-  I was told I cussed the staff out   What    My oldest is now 25 and had gone there also since he was a baby.
On December 19 2012 we took a prescription into CVS for Fluconazole  The tech advised us that for 60 tablets the price would be way over $200 and also advised that if we took the Rx to Fry's it would be much cheaper  Thinking the savings would be negligible we went ahead with 30 tablets at a cost of $10699  Requiring a refill we had the Rx moved to the Fry's store close to our home at the recommendation of the physician's nurse and were absolutely mortified when we got 60 tablets January 11 2013 for $16  Possibly we're talking the price difference between brand name and generic but then why didn't CVS offer us generic  What a total ripoff by a large chain that we thought we could trust - you can rest assured that will be the last Rx we ever take into a CVS store  Now we know why so many people take their prescriptions to Fry's.
I wish I remembered her name she was blonde thin and had a deeper voice she took my name and then sat down at her station to talk to her friend Maybe she was on break There was only one other stylist working 15 min later she seats me and brushes my hair and snags my earring with her comb THEN she asks me to take them off She could have told me before she hurt me She does a few snips and begins to talk with her friend that was sitting in the chair next to me and again practically ignored me  Second time here and I should've stuck with my initial gut feeling Never again.
I agree with Danielle I have been going there for years without a problem and I recently went there expecting the same service The place has changed I dropped a uniform off that I needed to pick up the same day so I made sure I was there before 9am when I went back to pick up and they told me since it is being laundered it won't be ready until tomorrow I showed my tickets that said current date by 4pm she then told me it's wrong how they don't do it like that anymore and how it would be too much work for them to find it for us but offered up half of the uniform I guess they don't understand the reason for a uniform How do you argue with someone with that kind of mentality.
The store can be bigger but they have great customer service My boyfriend and I were kicked out last july for something that we still don't know what we did we made a complaint to the HR in texas they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now I believed it was eric but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store.
NASTYI have been there twice and both time they were rude and acted like I was bothering them even being there   I would drive to Tempe or N Phoenix even though I live in SCottsdale  They SUCK.
Ok first time I was here was for lunch I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had Noticed the pool darts pinball golden tee and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place two days later for dinner and drinks 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night She was cooking bartending handling money scratching her head shaking hands cleaning bar tops running dishes etc did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time We ate our dinners disgustedly thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it She was entertaining all over the place yelling throwing things etc I'm pretty nieve and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time So there we have it a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulationsI'll be getting my hepititis c test next week (joking kinda).
Down hillThis place used to be great but now rests on its laurelsI remember a visit to Mastro' s used to mean perfection now it is just pretentiousI have been several times and always loved it but my last couple of visits have landed this place right in the toilet for me I don't think I will be giving it another visit after this latest episode:I took my dad and family for a birthday celebration because my dad just loved the place too We were greeted and asked about the special occasion by our server who took the opportunity to make jokes about age  All fine Took the drink order for a table of 4 and shows up with 3 drinks but totally forgot the guest of honor's  Oops  Takes our order and serves guest of honor with a barely cooked filet It was ordered medium-rare something Mastro usually nails it came out purple and raw in the middle  When commented on the server promptly picked it back up returned it to the kitchen and brought it back well passed medium Yikes Pay that much for a filet you should expect perfection they missed this one on both sides Not even a question whether it was okay To kick the final door in the table next to us was brought a nice birthday cake and birthday wish we were brought the bill Ouch I suppose being chided about age was gift enoughI was upset enough to write a letter I was very happy to get a voice message from the manager saying he'd like to discuss my experience I called him back and left a message but did not hear back I tried again and have still not heard back for over 6 months Looks like I'm done with this place.
Dropped my car off at 11am for a regular oil change 6 hours later not even touched They blamed it on their oil guy calling in sick So I guess their other mechanics can't change oil on cars This will probably be the last time I use Fletcher's.
My expierence was bad but happy to see there are some people who are giving 4 or 5 stars There is hopeGot seated at a dirty tableWhen they cleaned table with a wet ragin front of my date and myself as we are seated at the table the wet rag left a nasty mold smell Obiviously they didnt switch rags or water We moved to a different tableWhen I ran out of water I put my empty glass on the edge of the table for the waiter to at least get the hint I needed a refill When my beef Pita got to my table at a reasonable time I ate my dish without my glass of water being filled once by our waiter The only water I got after my first glass was water from my ice meltingMy date was smart and lightly drank her glass of soda throughout the entire sitFood was great but service sucked and only would be getting take outs from this particular location.
Alexis must be Susie's sister.
This place has great pizza but they have no respect for Giants spring training fans So save your money and go to Oregano's where they are not pretentious.
Seriously to be avoided at all costs The folks at this dealership are the stereo type of sleazy car dealers My husband and I stopped by early in the afternoon we were greeted by a saleswoman named Dee who was courteous We said we would return later that day no problem Unfortunately when we returned Dee was busy with another customer apparently she is the only person at this dealership that works We were instead handed over to a hefty man who did not introduce himself We asked for the price on a blue Mazda sitting right out front to which he replied "Well which one we've got a ton of blue Mazda's" Wrong my friend you have one its that bright beacon of blue in front of these big glass doors but OK whatever We walk over to the car where he tells me that the 96 ford Taurus on the lot would be a better match for me Great well I'm asking about this car not that beater Finally he agrees to tell us the price of the Mazda and we ask to talk prices about it and a truck for my husband When we go inside he walks into the fishbowl with his sleazy manager and they both come out and tell us they wont tell us prices on the cars until they run our credit We say we wont give them our information until we know whether or not we can afford the price of the cars and they proceed to tell us its federal law BS We told them bye and I called 2 other dealerships to confirm the crazy story they were telling us I called back and asked to speak to a manager I got the sleazeball and told him that I was very upset by the poor service and the lies I was being told He said he really didn't care because that's how they run their dealership Well my friend if that's how you run it I'm sorry to tell you you wont be running it long And he refused to give me his supervisors number but don't worry ill find it.
My wife and I took sw flight # 2196 PHX-MKE 10/22   We had just boarded the plane and I thought I had my phone off but I received an incoming phone call about the time they closed the door   I answered the call very quietly and a flight attendant by the name of WENDY yelled in the phone "he has to go"  People from 3 rows in front of me turned around   I have never wrote a review but the attendant carried the same demeaner for the 3+ hour flight   I know I was wrong but it could have been handled better   Free baggage fees don't make up for BAGS that are flight attandants.
We like to compare the calamari appetizer at different restaurantsWe questioned the server regarding the menu description which says the calamari contains zucchini: she assured us it was only a small amount The calamari arrived  with half squid and half zucchini and was also rubberyWe got up and left and went to Alessia's at Brown and HigleyIf you are in the east valley give it a try.
What a worthless store 6 customers waiting 3 employees standing around doing nothing but checking customers in And one employee goes home Why does Verizon have a store that don't want to help thier customers The manager johnny Acted like nothing was wrong Does he not realize there are a lot of people that have busy lives and then to be treated like a annoying customer This store should close so busy people don't have to be treated with such disrespect.
Can you say Dog Poop in your mouth Cuz that's what you'll be thinking when your eating at this place All these people hyped it up and compared this place to the Oh so delicious IN N OUT Which is the best fast food burger on the planet This place seriously gave me a stomach ache.
This place just has bad food  I've been there twice and been disappointed both times  All I remember from the first time was the shockingly horrible rice and beans  How does a Mexican restaurant not make good beans and rice  The beans were bland and the rice was old and hard and like the beans had no flavorThe second time I had a chile relleno it's supposed to be an egg based batter around the chile  This was just egg  It was like a chile inside an omlette  Which although not like mom used to make should taste good too but it was just swimming in oilThis place had a ownership change a few years ago and I am certain this place is just living off of it's old reputation  There are a few people who grew up with this place and they continue to recommend it  Oh and don't go to the place next door either Tony's sucks too.
This place a joke  It's pretty clear that they hired some fancy check to create their menu and then he has never touched the place since  We came here because I saw the WARM goat cheese salad on the menu  I'll get to that in a minute To start my husband's water glass had gobbs of lipstick all over it  Our server was actually quite friendly and she is the only thing about this place that deserves any stars  I ordered the warm goat cheese raspberry salad my friend ordered the caesar with dressing on the side and my husband got the quesadilla  The food came out surprisingly fast but it turns out that was because they forgot to cook it  The WARM goat cheese was breaded but ice cold  It had never even glanced at a heat source  And my salad was completely missing chicken  My friend's salad was slathered in dressing  Fortunately my husband's food was at least decent although he wasn't raving about it  We had to hunt down a random server because we couldn't find ours (she wasn't the person that brought our food) and it also took forever to get my drink refilled  She sent our food back and yet again it came back with cold goat cheese  The chicken was also cold and tough  I had just completely given up at this point and just ate it except the chicken which was tough and nasty  We also noticed that the table next to us received bread which looked quite wonderful but we didn't get any and would have loved to have some  I even made a comment about them not having bread We were completely disappointed and will never be back.
Was a member for two years but the lack of customer service finally got to me If you go don't be surprised if they loose your appointment an then offer to reschedule (what a joke) and then hang up on you - seems like the motto for this location is "it wasn't my fault talk to my manager".
This is without a doubt the worst drive thru I have ever been to in my life Whenever I've gone through they've messed up my order have given me lip and in general it feels like they try to place the blame on me for my order being wrong This place is rude they can't get the orders right and worst of all they do not take allergens into account We specified we wanted plain cream cheese because my girlfriend has a tree nut allergy so instead of that they gave us herb and garlic What that tells me is that they do not value their customers nor the information given to themTLDR: It was NOT a great day at Dunkin.
A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinnerI've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these daysThere were 5 of us including one fairly easy to please 10 year old  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages IN THE DESERT  C'mon  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself  It was only the beginningWhen the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered  Picture it a "hot" roast beef open faced sandwich which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen  How do I know that  Well you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave  It's gets hard and stale a texture that once you experience you won't soon forgetWhen we told the waitress that "tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess"  Her response was "It is for me too"  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM THEIR PROBLEMEnter the "Manager"  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything elseIf any of the restaurant staff reads this review please take one thing away from it You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES  If the kitchen truly was the problem they needed to step it up  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on you should have replaced her or reduced her section  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables)Ready for dessert  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them  I bet you know what's coming next What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave yaIn closing do I think this was meant to be four star dining NO  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight ABSOLUTELY  Did we catch them on a bad night  PROBABLY  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience  YOU BETCHYAGood luck here and I hope your experience is better than ours was.
Did everything they could to avoid doing the right thingS&M were responsible for a managing my corporate relocation package in conjunction with United Van Lines last year When our furniture arrived across the country our brand new $4000 leather sofa was scratched up with big baggy indentations and giant grease stain on itI immediately demanded a full replacement since what I had before the move was literally weeks old They responded that their policy was to "repair" the goods but to the contrary they provided a full replacement fee for all the smaller (cheaper) itemsWe agreed to allow a local "professional" leather company do the repair work and they only removed a few of the scratches The grease stains and the dents were still present and they even added new damages in transportation including ripping off one of the foot casters The repairs ultimately cost S&M $1750 and when I told them that it was unsatisfactory work they claimed they had fulfilled their contractual obligationsI ended up having a separate hearing (as per the contract to resolve any disputes) and despite providing both photos and written accounts of the poor service and damages S&M were somehow deemed to have satisfactorily repaired my sofaNow come to write these reviews and I find that "Advanced Leather Solutions" who performed this terrible work have consistent 1 and 2 stars on Yelp for poor service and even worse customer serviceI am so incredibly frustrated since in the long run it would have probably been near enough the same cost for them to just replace the sofa and we would have all been happy But as I stated they went so far as to use their legal team's time and resources to fight me to justify this terrible service which only added to their costs in this processWhat a waste of a year.
Would you like some over-priced mediocre pizza from an establishment that doesn't respect your right to self-defense I won't be back unless they lower their prices and take down that stupid No Guns sign.
Don't go here if you are hungry after 8pm  They close early wasted an hour driving to this location Never againClosed for the Super bowl  Wow.
Yeah walked in took one one look around one whiff of air and walked right back out My impression in that 30 seconds was enough to send me packing Gross Crowded Humid and smelly Tiny area and tiny selection of books I am a library lover And this place is only a mile from me so if there was a chance of it being worth my time I'd go but no Yuck.
This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days The decor is old The carpeting is tired The plates are chipped and scratched up The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat It took her another 10 minutes to replace it  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauceand then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually orderedHonestly I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos Definitely skip this spot.
Finally tried this place based on the reviews here  I don't know if we went on a off day or what but I was not impressed  Service was good very friendly however the food is another matter  I have had alot of bbq in my time  I am from Ohio and have eaten my fair share this was not even close to fresh homemade bbq  My husband and I decided to both get the smoked chicken sandwich a side of fries mashed potatoes and gravy and a slice of red velvet cake  When she handed us our sandwiches she said "Take some extra sauce the sandwiches are usually dry" extra sauce is fine I slathered it on but I found it strange that she put down the food right away  It was dry and served on the most generic bun  The sauce made up for it I poured it on and it was good  The best bbq chicken sandwich I think not  The fries were inedible  They were gross and soggy  The mashed potatoes were ok  I had to scrape the gravy off the top because it was a salty nastiness and eat them plain  I love gravy I swear I think this is the first time in my life that I have not liked a gravy  The red velvet cake was a huge disappointment  I had envisioned something homemade and yummy  Frankly it looked gross in the plastic container she handed me  It was all smashed up and there was whipped cream all over the container  Not good  Based on my experience here I would not go back  I find it hard to believe that this is talked of as the best bbq in Phoenix  I have had better bbq at chain restaurants.
I stopped by to get a feel for the store before commiting to a courtyard set purchase and refinishing of my chairs I had an ad that as published in Welcome Home AZ for a free umbrella from The Patio Store and I inquired about getting one I was taken aback by the mature looking male that tossed the ad back saying I need to spend $1000 While I dont have a problem with this requirement especially because the fine print read "some restrictions apply" the rudeness was uncalled for and it was a very demeaning experience I left with no intention of returning Again I have no prolem with the purchase requirement it makes sense the attitude and rude behaviour just did not.
Was in town for the gay rodeo with a friend from NY hoping his first rodeo experience would be hella fun Being country dancers we were hoping to tear up the dance floor every night we were in town All we got was more and more frustrated at the entire experience The country dj completely out of sight or reach had no clue the concept of playing to the crowd or even knowledge of country club music Meaningknowing the difference between a 2-step shuffle shadow west coast swing or east coast swingwhich btw not only did he only played 1 east coast swing all night Saturday  but ZERO waltz's The song selection although current top 40 hits (surprisingly because the line dances all but 2 were from the past 20 years done to the even more tired original songs from 20 years ago) was more like a bad juke box no format whatsoever and the transitions were horriblecutting off songs before they ended as the next song was abruptly forced in Upon making requests we were told "ok I think I have it" yet we never heard them Now I can understand club Djs not taking requests but in all the country clubs I've been to and this includes rodeos and other gay country dance events for the past 15 years requests are very crucial to keeping and making your guests feel welcome and included Especially if they are songs or dances that will show the locals something new they might like to try Now that's just the music The dance floor etiquette was non existant They have let the drunk queens take over the dance floor way before the music even switched over not caring one bit about the couples or dancers trying to menuver around them Only once were they told not to bring drinks to the dance floor but never to get their drunk asses out of the way before they get intentionally plowed into by people that are fed up with it The patio was useless for non smokers The dance floor is way too small for a club that brings in as many people as this one does What a wasted use of space where the volleyball court is That Should be the dance floor The only saving grace was catching up with old rodeo friends and the taco truck So this club along with the no dance floor and ridiculous all day entertainment at the rodeo grounds has reassured my friend and myself will NOT be returning next year.
After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons I checkeed thier priced on thier website but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.
Just wanted to share my experience just in case you are thinking of hiring this firm Hiring maria Jones firm was a living nightmare The treatment I received not only by the paralegal but also the front office staff was beyond ridiculous My phone calls and emails were never answer not to mention that my file got put in the back burner for months it took bout a year before I could meet with whom was going to  be my attorney and the only reason she decided to talk to me its because I thread to  file a complaint with the bar of attorneys They did nothing with my file I was the one that call the NVC to follow up  all this people are unprofessional and inefficient and I have proof  of it  I could go on and on with everything that went wrong Needles to say I decided to fire them and go with a different firm They had to reimbursed some of my money back for which I had to wait 30 days due to their policy All I have to say do your homework check them out In my personal opinion this company only cares about their finances and not their clients So stay away from them if you want to save yourself a lot of headaches.
My wife did not enjoy the manicure or the "spa pedicure" They bring over a porcelain/ceramic bowl to soak your feet in This doesn't seem very sanitary However the workers had plenty to say about the "Asian" shops being unclean My wife has never gotten a fungal or other type of infection from her regular place an "Asian" shop The manicure was awful too The polish looked terrible and lasted barely a week She definitely won't be returning.
HORRIBLE- greasy tempura and flat on one side  the roll was loaded with rice and that's about it  The waitress sat with her friends and talked even tho I needed some attenttion  At the end she thought by calling me "doll" that would make up for everything  I could not have been more disappointed and won 't ever do back- These guys will never take the place of Blue Wasabi.

Somewhat dirty store unfriendly staff flavorless food red/bloody looking meat will never go back.
Extremely disappointed during my last visit here I came in during the evening and was immediately bombarded by rap music playing over the stereo system with every other lyric using the N-wordNow I regularly listen to songs like this on my own time and I'm pretty sure the owner does not know his employees are playing their music with this kind of offensive profanityTo be specific the song I heard playing was "My Nigga" by YGIn addition the service was slow I was waiting at the counter 5 minutes before I even saw an employee He told me he would be just a moment more Instead of waiting for him to do the more important thing (probably switching the song to "Boss Ass Bitch") I went elsewhere.
This was just awful We were seated inside a nearly empty dining room for breakfast The waitress eventually came around and brought our drinks Coffee and a fork to stir for me We placed our food order Then waited And waited Finished our drinks No refills When the food finally arrived I figured out why it took so long:  they were blackening the bacon Yep they served us totally black bacon  Yuck  No apologies for the wait or anything My son was still hungry after his kids pancake (He wouldn't eat the bacon) So we bought him a pastry in the gift shop after our $50 family breakfast Will not return.
This store is awful The lines are consistently super long (seriously at a circle k) and the employees are lazy and rude At times lines are so long they wrap around the inside of the store Usually only one cashier will be working and the other employees hiding Not to mention the fact that the place is not kept clean and it's a newer store The employees absolutely do not care Is there a manager running this place The manager should be firedOn a side note there is one employee Jessica who is always really nice.
By far the worst pharmacy I've ever used Never have prescriptions when they promise I spend at least 30 minutes each time I come here waiting This it's time to move my prescriptions to Walmart.
I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back  Bad business ethic  They have an answering service so there is no excuse  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof I would have received a call  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me.
Absolutely TERRIBLE Hands down the worst massage I have every had They have no clue what they are doing I left after 20 minutes it was that bad Even just that 20 minutes did more harm than good I feel ten times worse now then before I went in there yesterday If you would rather be further injured than this is the place otherwise STAY AWAY I I could give them less than one star I would.
I am an art lover but don't dig the overkill by the people who are "guarding" the art from the common folk  After having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with Heather the manager I will most likely not return  They are many friendlier art installations in the valleyI will give them my hard-earned support instead.
QUANTITY NOT QUALITY mostly NOT EDIBLEThe good-my ice tea and the pickle chipsThe bad-rye bread as thick as my thumb (rye bread should be thin)low fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease (because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich) and other assorted grease The dressing was thinned down to a milky substance The cheese used was processed not real cheese  The sour kraut had a few of someones grilled burger onions in it The salad was water logged and not drained and I had an inch or more of water in the bowlThe waitresses all were sleeveless and that doesn't seem sanitary because of all that reaching everywhere how do you know if some deodorant or antiperspirant didn't flake off into your food  My waiter seemed very rushed the whole timeFelt sick to my stomach after hereand on the way out I saw ketchup bottles on the patio tables outside that may have been opened and were possibly spoiling in the high heat outsideI know most people only enjoy the fatty breakfast here since they are used to that  and that is cool  They are really large and most people I saw were LOVING that.
My first and last Whatacrappyburger Nasty grey patty and one of the heaviest burgers ever Needed to cook some more once back home but i could only eat half of this junk before I threw in the towel Free fries and drink helped soften the blow but this chain is a disaster In and Out is way better I can't believe how bad the burger was too bad cause they spend alot of money on billboards but not even on quality food obviously.
I would not recommend this place if it was the last place to stay at We needed a cheap month to month place while we were buying our house no contract  What we should have done was rented a apartment for the four months (we ended up staying two and going to an apartment month to month for the other We were on the ground floor and at night needed to put a towel under the door because of the roach problem not to mention the notice from other guests We got one coffee pouch when we first checked in but When we asked for more they told us no and that the towels were only delivered once a week when they came to clean unless we went to front desk which was fine until our personal towels went missing and were replaced by theirs  They never did find our towels  And insisted we not be there when they cleaned our room Hmm wonder why I'll quit rambling save your money and stay else where or get a cheap month to month apartment.
I first experienced Zinburger in Tucson of all places and I loved it I went as often as I could when I was in town It was hands down my favorite place to eat in Tucson and I was itching for it to move to PhoenixOn my first visit to Zinburger my vision of the perfect burger meal shattered The place itself is wonderfully stylized and the staff are perky (but new) but the food was disappointing On my first visit I had a glass of Reisling and the Zinburger and my favorite truffle fries The Zinburger was greasy and the bun was soggy when it came out and the fries weren't as tasty as I remember them being in Tucson But since I loved Zin so much I wanted to give it a second chanceI met up with a friend for happy hour (wait no happy hour at a burger and "wine" bar) and tried to play it safe with the Plain and Simple burger The fries were tastier this time and the server was happy to split the Bananas Foster shake (which was very yum) but the burger just did not deliver It wasn't soggy this time but rather normal Nothing special I might as well have been at Denny'sThe staff on the other hand seemed very knowledgeable and friendly but that doesn't change the disappointing foodI will probably give Zin ONE MORE CHANCE I just can't get over how heartbreaking the food is compared to the Tucson one But I'm not about to drive 2 hours just for a burger.
This place is horrible Didnt warn us the course was bad from the rain They then sent us to hole 1 when only the back 9 was open Then when we stopped on the 16th cuz the course was so jacked up Once we talked with the "pro" the only thing he could do to make it right was another round here I don't want another round because I never want to come back Play somewhere better for your money Worst course and customer service I have ever experienced.
I was totally embarrassedtook a customer there for the "lunch buffet" it was on the menumenu was located t the entrance of the restaurant was told  no we don't do that anymore "all we have is a salad bar" "it was  a month ago that we did that" "it was only temporary" etc (then take it off your f'ing menu you doltthis meal choice was a suggestion from some of my friends/employed at /from the city of chandlerI am so pissed that I can't even type straight just now  came from there I will tell everyone I can about this we will never go there again.
We stopped by tonight a quarter to 9pm to get take out We've never been here before but have been wanting to try it out since we moved nearby We walked in and said hello to the teenage girl working behind the counter who did not respond She was counting change and turned to look at the clock on the wall My fiancée asked are you still open to which she gave him the finger to hold on and then said we close in 10 mins I told him lets go as she had already given us enough bad service As we walked out she put her purse on and turned the lights off before we even got into our car We won't be going back with that type or service Too bad management hasn't taught this teenage girl any customer service We will just continue to give other local Gilbert restaurants our loyal service.
Yuck Just ordered a chicken pita and it was completely tasteless and soggy Won't be back.
i have no heat until Wednesday Owner is not willing to do anything about it Enough said.
You can't really criticize BWW for the mediocre food served in paper boats and dressing packets for salads  They are a national company that seems to be doing something right considering their success  However you'd think such success would translate to some kind of service standard  I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place  It was the ASU v UofA football game and the place was overflowing  According to our server the shortage of bartenders justified our second round of drinks taking more than an hour MORE THAN AN HOUR  Unfortunately for him the lack of bartenders could not be blamed for the food taking even longer  At one point after checking three times to see if a runner had brought our drinks someone got up from the table to ask him if they were ever going to come  His response "You didn't order more drinks"  Let me say that again  He checked back with us three times to see if we had gotten a round of drinks that according to him we never ordered  Confused  So were we If they keep this up they won't last much longer than Six Shooters.
Drove around Scottsdale looking for the waterfront and all we saw was a small dirty man-made canal  Not much of a waterfront is it  Another disappointing Scottsdale "attraction"  Not worth searching for or traveling to   I don't know why the city would even have signs directing people here  It's even labeled on the tourist maps and everything  Waste of time.
Meh It's Starbucks The coffee sucks the drinks are way overpriced for what they are and all the money goes to a corporationGo down the street and buy coffee from Copperstar and at the same time support the community you live in.
Food's good but I reckon Lenny makes his cashiers spend their breaks poking each other in the eyeWhy else would all the cashiers be in such a bad moodPeanut butter chocolate milkshake is the only reason to come back.
The service is good but the food is not great The pizza was soggy and had very little toppings looked and tasted like cheese pizza We requested that they should add more toppings so they added little bit more topping on the existing pizza which ended up tasting terrible The manager spoke to us and advised us that we should have ordered double topping A large pizza and with three toppings cost $22  to $25 (the food is not cheap)  There are so many good pizza restaurants in the valley who serve tasty pizza's and do not skimp on toppings  I have no plans to visit this restaurant in the future.
Worst hotel ever for this "level" Upon check in the elevator door wouldn't close after 4 attempts we used the stairs We get to our room and the key doesn't work The front desk gave us the wrong room key It actually opened another room Lucky we aren't thieves" The TV did NOT work so we went without There is nothing like crud in the corners of the bathroom floor from a lazy mop job over many weeks (obviously) for that kind of build up Gross overall If you are looking for somewhere within walking distance to Chase Field we did not find it threatening to walk in that area Late at night after a game there are a lot of people and vehicles around Those reasons are why it seemed OK for the area I must say however in 104 degrees it is a lot more of a walk than you think Had we known parking is cheap (under 10 bucks for some GREAT parking) we would have stayed FARTHER out at a Hilton.
Food was okay at best Portions were very small Probably some of the worst service Very disappointing Hopefully downtown can get some better breakfast options.
some of the vegetables that they use here are not even fresh look like they are come from a frozen veggies bag that you could get at Walmart The food is way too expensive with a small portion Haft order of the tom kha soup is way too much mushroom than meat very disappointed.
$$$$$ Hard Liquor & Hard Beats DOWNTOWN Phoenix $$$$BRING YOUR CREDIT CARDSAn outdoor bar/dance club in front of the building next door to Fate (situated right off Roosevelt Row in The Evans-Churchill District)  Nightly DJs  and outdoor drinking (and dancing ()) with a PERFECT view of the ever improving downtown skyline  Sadly they have NO "shelf/house" liquor selections so drink prices are pretty Damn HIGH  I mean WAAAY high  $11 for the cheapest rum & cokeThis is YET AGAIN another business venture making another huge improvement in the Downtown Art District  HOWEVER sadly the drink prices are just to high for this place to become much of a regular hang-out.
Do you love flying US Airways and paying $2 for water $15 for a checked bag and $1000 to take a bathroom break Well then you'll love Camden Copper Square apartments In terms of ridiculous charges they are the "US Airways" of apartmentsOperated by the Wal-Mart of multi-family housing in America (Camden) the prosaic garden apartments near the Phoenix Children's Museum offer you the privilege of paying a broad array of fees How about $30/month (plus $10/month for the trash dumpster) to have your trash picked up S-R nights outside your door I guess they're going for true "NY chic" by allowing you to pay for the privilege of piling trash outside of your door in a wooden box Don't worry There's more $40/month for "included" cable sound "entertaining" Or expensive water fees that are charged based on square footage instead of how much water you use I save the best for last however Enjoy paying $30/month for so-called "association fees" This means the Camden corporation passes its property tax assessment for getting advertising in the city's downtown partnership "Copper Square" maps and pamphlets on to its residents Stressed out about having to choose between "valet trash" or being a member of the "association" Don't worry You are required to pay both feesWhile the office staff is generally friendly (some members are really exceptional) and maintenance service is adequate the fees charged by this complex are entirely out of line when added to the complex's higher-than-average base rents Attempts to reason with the regional staff about the fees are met by: "this is a corporate-level/national policy"The pool areas and club house are nice but why pay so much for what you can get in any complex or condo community in Phoenix The reason I still live here is because I'm leaving the area in May and wanted to spend the summer traveling and not moving boxes in the PHX oven Those seeking a long-term home in downtown with more freedom of action than myself should pass over this fee-crazy complex for lower-priced condos or historic home rentals with more charm and nicer interior finishes I'm just waiting for an announcement for a "Camden Copper Square" credit card to come out of my bedroom's fire alarm speaker and wake me up--yes that would truly make this community rival this town's hometown airline for ridiculousnessFinally when I left Camden Copper Square they tried to charge my roommate and I SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS for paint -- when I complained and threatened to go to the BBB and small claims court I was told it was "all just a mistake" It was so bizarre considering that there was just minor wear and tear on the walls So be warned -- if you live here be prepared to aggressively defend your bank account upon moving out -- or Camden will aggressively try to attack you to bolster its mega-sized profits.
Just went there recently and I honestly thought the place was closed and getting ready to move because it was super cluttered knick knacks everywhere and a stench of mold that was only slightly tolerable The people were nice but I did still get a Silence of the Lambs vibe from them enough for me to choose a table farthest from them They also charged me an extra $200 for using a card to pay for a $370 drink and did not inform me that would happen To give them the benefit of the doubt we'll assume there was a sign that I happened to not see that informs patrons of this By the time my friend arrived I had already sent her a text that said "Pretty sure these people are going to skin me alive" My friend wanted to order a burger from them but like other people mentioned I strongly question the uphold of health codes in the joint We left and actually went to Panda Express because even that was a step above the Coffee Cove.
First off let me tell you that my husband and I have been making this a regular stop about 8-10 times a month When we have to go to a couple stores and we we stop there first to have a meal because it is across the street  One I had worked till 3:30am and had not woken till about 10:30 am and When my husband said we had to go to a couple stores I suggested a stop for something to eat at what had been one of my favorite places Good food mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else I asked for a rum and coke he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day I paid my check and told him that we would not be back He said " who cares" He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal My husband always orders for me Point is that although they stay busy most times they just lost over $200+ a month because of his behavior Maybe they should think to ask the person they took over for what the story was Did my shopping and now I will go spend my money somewhere else.
A beautiful decorum does not make for their terrible pizza.
This place was filthy We ate at a Sizzlers in Cottonwood AZ 2 days before and we liked it soo much we decided to look for one close to our Phoenix hotel Since there are only 2 Sizzlers in Phoenix we picked this one and arrived  aroung 630 pm We entered this place and were kind of welcomed by a grumpy manager( that should have been a sign) placed our order and looked for a clean table We found 1 in a corner the rest wasn't cleanedWe took our plastic plates and went to the salad-bar Several trays were empty and were not refilled The fries were cold there was food everywhere on the floor I ate my steak which was ok my wife didn't eat anything i drank my Coke(no refills) asked for the bill and went to the bathroom Oh my Godno words for this experienceNever again in this dump They should go to Cottonwood to learn how to run a restaurant in a proper way.
I noticed this place pulling in to the shopping center where Barrelhouse wasa video shop what in the heckso weird  Anyway I walk out and I realize I have been looking for Devil's Reject's and House of 1000 Corpses for god knows how long  Screw it why not check this place outIf you thought to yourselfman video stores have been out since the early 90's  Not this one  This one has been out since the 80's  The carpet had like palm trees  And even better there's an adult section in the back that has mint colored palm tree cut outs that go across the top of the doorwaymust be the entry way to heaven oOUnfortunately they didn't have either movie I wanted  Otherwise I would've gotten past the ugliness and the stale smell of my indoor childhood skating rink  I have no reason to come back to this place because I live in THIS century and I will just buy them online So much for nostalgia.
Do the groomers even like dogs I will never return here They treated us like garbage and they did not even acknowledge our dogs If you are not happy to see my dogs then I am not going to leave them with you The staff did not help as our hands were full with 2 dogs when they asked for information Our dog pooped on the floor and of course we apologized Nothingnot even a "its ok"Did not even make eye contact with us or offer to help As you can imagine we left and took our dogs elsewhere.
The food is ok for takeout but the restaurant service is not so good   Their pizza has a thin crust and the sauce is tangy and the cheese is tasty  The pasta dishes are average but the Penne Alla Vodka needed more sauce and less pasta  The chicken dishes are not recommended  The chicken piccata and marsala are both made with a thin sauce not too much flavor and the chicken is overcooked  The restaurant service is slow  The last time I went it was a Thursday night and the entire restaurant was empty  I was glad because I thought that meant we would have fast service  The waiter took our drink order and then didn't come back with the drinks for almost 10 minutes I think he was folding pizza boxes   And the worst part he didn't bring the wine my mother ordered  When she asked for her wine his response was "Oh we ran out of that kind of wine"  You think he would have came back to the table sometime in those 10 minutes to tell her that they don't have the wine she ordered  (by the way there were only 3 white wines on the menu)  He never even offered her a different kind of wine    My husband and I both ordered our chicken dishes with sauteed veggies and both our dishes came out with spagetti instead of veggies  They brought the veggies out for my husband but I never got mine The waiter didn't seem to care about anything   Because of the lousy service I would not eat in this restaurant again.
I have been coming to this subway during my lunch hour for over a year The service use to be great but there was a staff change that occurred over 6 mths ago They have never been very friendly but today especially everyone had a bad attitude Staff is very rude Some of the workers were even  slamming doors and being rude to one another as well as to the customers I don't recommend eating here.
THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED- See their new Raul & Theresa's on Litchfield Road just north of I-10.
We only went here because it has been a traditional Father's Day event with friends  We decided to join them for the 1st timereallywe will never go back This place is a dump Today was 110 degrees the air condition felt like a swamp cooler the service was not great either We did blow out a kegso reconnecting the keg took awhile  The service staff really tried to do their best but it's The Shed I and it has not changed over the years  Unless your desparate for a beerafter a softball game at Kiwanis Parkkeep on driving.
We've been going here since it opened several years ago and it keeps getting worse Food is good not great Service has never been good here but it seems to get worse each time we come back The woman who manages or owns the place never even acknowledges us She looks at us each time we come in like she has never seen us before She seems to have no problem bs'ing with the other patrons but ignores us Not that we really want to chit chat with her but a polite "hello welcome back" would be nice They have raised the wine prices to the point of most high end restaurants They have also taken ingredients out of there food For example the louisiana po'boy used to includechicken breast shrimp andouille sausage with a choice of red beans and rice or gumbo Now it only comes with the chicken no shrimp or andouille sausage The andouille is available at extra cost You no longer have a choice of the red beans & rice or the gumbo only fries The only reason we are still going here is that we previously purchased some discount coupons We have two coupons left to use and that will be our final dining experience hereAlso beware if you are going here for the first time as their online menu is old and not updated.
Lost my tire center cap broke my radiator hose Nice work otherwise.
horrible business practicesthese guys are telemarketing monsters you know the constant calls even when you've asked them to stop -- its these guysdo not give them your business go somewhere else.
First things first they are not Greek Ok I too have given this place more than one chance First visit was ok Met the owner and was excited they were there I work in the area Second visit I encouraged other employees to try the food I called and asked if we could give them our order the day before so it would be ready before lunch crowd No One of the rude girls there said no you have to call the day of the pick up So we called in our orders all nine of them as soon as they opened When we got there we had to stand in line with people who were placing orders-12 of them Ok our food sat there for over 30 minutes that we knew ofFriday evening at 7:55 I called and asked what time they closed and one of those girls told me 9:00pm  I drove 12 miles back to the area When I arrived at 8:45 pm I assume the same girl I had spoken with earlier said we decided to close early tonight Thats enough for me  The owner needs to send his girls to charm school and they need to know customers aren't coming in because of them.
If you want your waitress to get drinks for three tables at the same time and take time to take an order at another table while carrying your drinks Ling and Louie's is your place If you want your appetizer salad and entree to arrive at the same time ling and Louies is your place If when you complain you want a manager to say " this is unfortunate " Ling and Louies is your place He did say that they would do better next time With lots of good restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale there will not be a next time We eat out at the best restaurants in the area four nights a week Trust me missing Ling and Louies will not be a great loss Incidentally this is the first time that I have ever written a bad review for a restaurant.
Do Not Eat Here  The waiter was soo rude to my son he made him cry My son moved his chair to sit closer to me and the waiter yelled at him to "sit down stay  there and be quiet and if you touch me again you are going to need your mommy" my four year old was just trying to move closer to me because he hadn't seen me all day We were appalled on how rude he was Who says that to a child I get it it's not a kid place we weren't looking for a kids menu and crayons but we did nothing to get treated like that That is not how customers should ever be treated and we will never return with or without the kids.
YuckI thought it was related to Cracker Barrel Cheese It's a cute country style store if you are looking for candy from the past and rockersbut do not go for foodThey do have a really good Sweet TeaSay no the dumpling and chicken I've never had it so I had to try but now I wish I didn't.
I CAN"T BELIEVE THIS PLACE  First off every time we would take our animals here for their routine shots etc we NEVER got to see the vet  All we ever got were high school looking kids with huge gage earrings torn jeans and t-shirtsreal professional  Today I received a call at work from my girlfriend who was crying hysterically  She said that something was wrong with Bailey our schnauzer  She said that she was acting very very ill  I told her to take Bailey to the vet which this vet is the closest  She ran in and was told by the lady behind the counter that the vet was eating lunch and could not be bothered and after lunch he was going in to surgery so she should just go find another vet  Are you flippin' kidding me  What a load of trash  We will NEVER go back and I hope you don't either.
I went to Social Tap for happy hour to meet a friend when it first opened Friendly service drinks were nothing special Fast forward a year and a half later or so went to their website to check out their lunch special and found their $3 burger deal Called it in and was rudely told that their site was "outdated" and have "$5 lunch menu" now that's not on their website Girl taking the order was rude When asked what's on the "$5 menu" she literally "huffed" LOL and said the menu was for "dine-in only for the people over at the Galleria" Duh I'm at the Galleria Ordered the chicken tenders off that menu for a friendand if you like micro waved rubbery chicken and bad service--you'll like Social Tap Can't even get myself to give it 1 star.
Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant (Sushi Roku) but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the poolUnfortunately the W has cashed in on the Vegas party pool idea and lets wannabes who aren't staying in the hotel turn up and reserve the loungers This meant that I had to pay $50 for my gf and I to lie in the sunYou would have thought that paying guests would get priority but it seems like every skank and db in Scottsdale is more important.
I was sold on loving hut until I recently discovered they don't even use organic vegetables All the glitz and glamour of "saving the planet" "going green" and advocating forks over knives but they use the cheap pesticide filled veggies everybody else does or possibly worseGMO It is a sham I just assumed they would be organic since thats what being vegan and healthy is all about but it's just more tricks from a business trying to turn a profit from people looking for healthy alternatives Just call and ask and they will tell you they don't use organic UNACCEPTABLE.
DONT COME HERE Groupon users beware I saw a sweet deal on groupon (15$ for four people for open skate) that was only a sweet deal online The skates were so worn our feet had bruises on them afterwards The lady who helped us with our skate size gave us all a size up even when we asked for a smaller size It was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in As we managed to make the best of it  but could not bare we headed off the ice and a hockey coach saw our shoes were to big and mentioned next time we should get smaller skates on our way out We also got off the ice because they rushed us off by starting to cleaning the ice 20 minutes before our time was up Oh yeah It's also very hidden and hard to find.
I purchased a $1500 for $3000 groupon I went to redeem and purchased a 1999 bouquet of roses and a 999 teddy bear totaling 2998 Making it a steal of a deal right BUT WAIT They forgot to mention there is a $3200 "service fee" Thus making my 1999 roses a 4500 dollar purchase 6000 if I didn't have the groupon I wish I had read reviews first prior to purchase that obviously would have been a great help.
I would have never used their service if I had known they would harrass me with repeat sales phone calls They continue to bombard me with sales calls years after they replaced my glass  Even after requesting that they not call they continue to do so This is very unprofessional in my opinion I would not recommend them based on my experience I have used Penske glass and had great experience with them and they have not bothered me with repeat sales calls.
The was the worst maintained course I've played on maybe ever I could see more brown dirt than green grass on much of the fairways and even the greensI won't go back and I will tell people to avoid.
Horrible service waited for a table for 30 after being told 5 min Waitress seating people removed us from list without calling our name Sit down and still no service have to flag down a waiter to be told it isn't their section   Never coming back.
NEVER AGAIN  My Girlfriend and her family live in Casa Grande  I was there and we ordered delivery  I got a large pepperoni and some wings  They have an insane delivery timeit was over an hour  Fine I can live with thatHowever after I took the food upstairs and after the guy left I noticed the pizza box was open  I opened it all the way and it looked like it fell on the side of the box before it was delivered  The pizza was smashed up against the side of the box  Not the lidthe side of the boxAdditionally the wings looked the same  There was sauce all up the side of the box as if it was carried on the sideAnd Mr Delivery guy:  When I pay with a credit card and I am required to sign you should bring a pen  Come onI will NEVER order from here again  I should have read the reviews beforehand.
Once was enough Everyone was raving so we tried it He had breakfast and said "meh" and mentioned that he couldn't tell what kind of grease the eggs had been cooked in But no big deal However I had something called that if I recall was a sirloin salad-the name escape me It was advertised as a garden salad tossed with sliced grilled sirloin The waitress tried to warn me against the dressing it comes with offering me a choice of another--I should have taken her up on I think they got the dressing they used in a hunting shop-think something that might attract a bear or something The meat was a far from sirloin as it could have been I couldn't cut it I couldn't chew it I have no idea what it was Never again.
An adequate downtown motel  Access and proximity are both good  The location appeared to be clean and well-kept  However I'm now reading that they allow pets in guest's rooms making it no more than a fancy kennel  Unless they spray for fleas daily  (they don't) I'm not feeling good about this  Parking is atrocious and the Raddison parking garage (a half-block away) must be used  Service at the front desk was eager to help but only Briana seemed to be able to operate their computer system at check-in  There is only a $9 breakfast buffet here but plenty of nearby places to eat  Elevators are fast in this eight (ten) floor motel  Both water pressure and hot water were extremely good on the 3rd floor sometimes it was impossible to get COLD water  My coworker on the 4th floor had the same observation  Their WiFi (free) never failed but was very slow (below dial-up speeds)  My coworker wisely travels with a CAT5 LAN cable I'll do the same next time  The heating/cooling system does not appear to be aligned with the wall thermostat room temperatures were never right  Although the big screen televisions in each room are low-grade channel selection is extremely good  Our business rate was $13999 ($15857 with taxes) and that is reasonable for this motel  I would come back for a few days at a time when business dictates but this motel wouldn't be my first choice for a week-long stay.
NoI said - NO.
Oh my Restaurant week 2011   This meal was a disaster Terrible servicetotally non existent  service No beverages offered and we had to ask for them  There was a 25 minute wait for a reserved table whilst 10 empty tables needed to be cleared Food incredibly lacking in flavor  Lobster was NOT servedit was langoustine  Steaks mediochre to be kind  Excessively salty saladcould not eat it Pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce Honestly good pie ruined  ONE WAITER HUMMED LOUDLY FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING He wasn't part of the entertainment Will never waste money there again So many great restaurants in townTHIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
Unfortunately I have to update my review to one star Since our last experience we have tried to come back to Epiq on more than one occasion to no avail They are now charging $20 on Fridays AND Saturdays even to womenThe last time I talked to the bouncers was the final attempt I'd ever make It was 12:45am on a Friday night and they refused to drop the cover charge You want each one of my girlfriends (7 of us total) to pay $20 for only one hour of entertainment I even asked them to reduce it to $10 and they said noSo I vowed not to ever go back and went to Dollhouse instead The lovely VIP host comped us a bottle and a round of shots so that's where my 5 stars my girls and my money are going.
Overpriced typical "hotel fancy food" that isn't fancy or particularly good.
If it weren't for Yelp making me give it at least 1 Star this place would get ZERO that's right ZERO stars  I have had one bad experience after another with these guys  The pizza is great IF you ever receive it after they tell you it will be a 30-min delivery then you call back after 1hour and they tell you "the driver is on his way" then you call back after another half hour and they can not locate your order WTF have you ever heard of a COMPUTER system where you LOG orders when people call  I know what a fantastically high-tech concept but then maybe people would get the pizza they ordered  I am finally writing this review because i just had the same experience at a Domino's in Phoenix ( I live in San Fran and usually order from there) (COULDN'T BELIEVE IT) so this seems to be a widespread problem  I will never again give Domino's my business.
I was in this location on November 9 2013 I waited about 15 minutes to be helped A nice young girl at the register was trying to finally help me when her manager LIZ via the earbuds asked her to stop helping me She had to immediately walk away and go back to the register (Which seemed uncesssary to me when there were 2 other employees working the registers without a line)I proceeded to talk with LIZ and she apologized that I was inconvenienced yet did not offer to help answer my questions or even walk over to assist me choosing my daughter's first make-up compact I needed professional care and she could have cared less Maybe she could have requested the young employee return to the register after she finished helping meI gave her my bags of items I wanted to purchase and walked out (After I told her how poor her decision was and treating her employee and me poorly)The next day I went to another Ulta in Chandler AZ and the male manager was so kind He was appauled by LIZ's behavior and said this is not the policy of Ulta I write this to warn you that if you go to this Ulta location you will receive poor customer service By the way it would help if Ulta would be better about keeping enough item of their own brand cosmetics in stock It seems every time I go they have a poor selection.
By far the worst cupcake shop I have visited yetIf you like duncan hines or betty crocker cupcakes and frosting this is your place that is exactly what the cupcakes look and taste like  I didnt even finish mine and that is shocking for me I adore pastries I threw the rest of mine in the trashI dont see how they stay in business sad but true.
Pharmacists are incompetent and lack communication between each other A simple drop off turned into a repetitive 12 question process I gave them my pharmacy discount card and it took them almost 15 minutes to process the information Drop your scrips off down the street at Safeway over this place.
Service was bad and food was subpar.
I don't think this place even deserves a single star I used to go here but had a couple of terrible experiences the last times I was there They used to be 'okay' but then they hired some new pharmacists that were totally rude and stuck up I went in there in a lot of pain from a recent dentist appointment The young girl at the counter didn't even greet me she just took my prescription looked at it rolled her eyes and walked away 10 minutes later she came back without having said anything else and tells me "We don't have this" Why the hell would it take you that long to figure that out Why were you so rude Why didn't you have the medicine I needed This place sucks and their employees have really sucky attitudes Stay away from this place.
I wouldn't even give this place one star We researched on the Internet and decided to check it out We drove an hour and when we reach the place it's freakn CLOSED There was nothing on the Internet about that Sign said closed for reorganization So we called to see when they would be open thinking that hopefully the would be open before I leave Phoenix in a week But guess what The freakn phone number had been disconnected Go figure Even if they were to call and say we're open tomorrow I wouldn't go back.
No wifi Shame 25 min wait for takeout or dine in -- at 1:15 on a Sat They need more staffFood has gone down-hill here  Very inconsistent  Used to be a consistent winner but now we've had several mediocre to inedible dishes on multiple visits.
Had THE MOST HORRIBLE experience at this hotel We checked in and left for the mall Came back to shower and get dressed and we noticed a few gnats Just ignored it thinking they came in with us having the door open because our friends were also staying there and were coming in and out of our room Next day my friend was in the shower and when she got ready to get out the toilet floor and sink were COVERED with gnats They had completly covered our toothbrushes and our towels She screamed and I went in the bathroom and ran back and grabbed my camera I took a picture and showed the front desk agent Lilian she said she would call someone 15 min later I walk back to the front desk and she is sitting on the couch in the lounge area talking on her cellphone UHHH Hello did you not just get a complaint and you're just taking this very lightly She then says shes calling the maintenance man (whom lives under the room we were in with a dog Were these gnats or fleas Whatever it was made my friend itch and scratch to the point where her skin broke out) Lilian came up to the room and when she seen them it made her skin crawl to where she started scratching Eventually the maintenance man showed up While he inspected the room we showed our friends 2 doors down and they also said they had seen a few also but not as many as we had The front desk agent tried to offer us a new room but if our room had gnats and our friends rooms had gnatswhy would we even want to stay there Who knows what other type of critters may be lurking in the bed sheets (Im itching as I type this) So we decided to pack our bags and find another hotel The next morning when we called to speak to them about our experience there we spoke to Andy the manager (who needs a class in customer service) he stated that we should have taken the room they offered us no refund and went back and forth with us and eventually hung up in our face We called back and he would pick up the phone and hang upPictures nextDO NOT STAY HERE AND IF YOU DO SHAKE YOUR BELONGINGS BEFORE YOU GET IN YOUR CAR.
The hours say they are open until 10pm Tuesday through Thursday but they activated their after hours answering message at 9:30pmLittle Chicago apparently hires staff that likes to close up early Makes me suspicious of how much care they put into their pizza.
I really think I need to try this place again it was 15 stars I felt no tingly feels as it seems others haveThe wine by the glass was over priced we paid $20 for each large pour of good but not great wine And our server had NO CLUE about the wines A place like this should educate their serversbrussel sprout salad (3/5)- dressing was seriously lacking flavor would have been a 5/5 if the dressing was goodprime rib (2/5)- large cut very little flavor except for the crust the cut was too lean thus was not as tender or flavorful as it should have been we got two of these at the table both were the samedesert (1/5)- pecan gelato was flavorless- red velvet cake was flavorless and/or had too little actual cake 3x too much cream cheese filling.
Wait for the food for long time and it was greasy not good.
Talk about horrible customer service Their pizza was horrible and drenched in grease It took 10 paper towels to get some off it off They have horrible attitudes  towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food I've worked in 5 star restaurants and would've gotten fired on the spot if I treated a customer like they treated me  Beware This place is the worst place I've ever been too I would take Peter Piper Pizza over this crap.
My family and I visited this chili's a few nights ago when we had company in town and decided to stop in for dinner after shopping near by We had walked past people who told us is was an hour wait time we chose to go in and check it for ourselves when we walked in we asked the host for a table for 5 he said im sorry but there is an hour wait (no one was waiting in the lobby and as I looked around there were many open tables) it was 7:30ish pm so they weren't getting ready to close I asked if they were short staffed because there were many tables open he said yes I see them myself and no we aren't short staffed that is just what my manager had asked me to tell people WOW so I look over to the bar area and see a table over there and asked if it was open seating and he said yes so that is where we sat We waited over 10 min for us to be greeted service was very slow people continued to walk in the door asking for tables as the host still continued to tell them the 1hr wait time I saw at least 5 or more groups of people walk out (what manager runs a business like this why would he not wan his place full I have worked in this industry for 10+ years including chili's for 2+years a one point and I have NEVER seen a restaurant ran that way Anyways aside from that the 1 server taking on the entire bar section is being flooded with more people because they are no longer seating the dining area the manager ran a few items which came over without a smile or how is everything he in fact was rude and seemed inconvenienced to bring us anything The mushroom burger my sister ordered was not a mushroom burger it was actually a regular burger that they just added mushrooms on top it had red onions instead of sautéed onions it had pickles and lettuce tomato etc all the fixings that would come on a regular burger I told the server to let him know so they weren't continuing to serve it this way to other guests ad he said ok thanks I can get you a free desert if you want to which we declined I would definitely not want to go into that chili's again until they hired a manager that can run a restaurant.
Oh Phoenix you did it again  How can you screw up breakfast  Cold eggs congealing on a plate  Yes  Raw yet greasy potatoes that taste like chorizo Yes  Cold limp bacon Yes  Possibly the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life  If you want a bad breakfast I would recommend 5 and diner for a truly horrific experience I would go Joe's Diner all the way.
We were disappointed with everything  The waiter was good  We ordered the  Roasted Garlic Plate for appetizer $10--very good but heavy  We decided to share an entree because we were so full after the app  We had the Soccoro Chicken which was not very southwesternmore Italian  The red pepper potatoes were flavorless as was the chicken This dish is way overpriced at $22 We each had a drink 1 wine 1 beer  The service was annoying  The water server kept coming to try to take our plates before we were done  This happened three times Then at the end of the meal while one of us was still eating she placed a dirty plate on our table then stacked one of our plates on it  Disgusting  The owner and servers continually troll the aisleit was disruptive as they passed the booths I know they are trying to be watchful of patrons in need  However with the girl who kept trying to take our plates it was annoying I told our waiter about the server's error in putting the used plate on our table and her over-eagerness in trying to take our plates Nothing was said to usWe are NOT going back.
After 3 weeks my Galaxy S4 decided to stop charging I came in and was helped by David after plugging it in and realizing it wasn't going to charge said we need to figure out if it's a battery issue or a problem with the charging port He asked a co-worker Gina if he could borrow her battery for a minute so we could have a definitive answer She said NO (in a really rude tone) and explained that I'll need to wipe my phone to see if it still doesn't work I told her I needed to be able to make sure my G Cloud backed up my phone plus wiping it with 6% battery life would cause the phone to shut off in the middle of it and brick my phone a chance she thought I should take Well even if I could wipe it without bricking it I'm not going to just wipe my phone if it's a battery issue She said they don't have any batteries laying around I said well he asked if we could use yours real quick and you said no she then rolled her eyes and walked away I asked her to come back so we could keep discussing this but she refused David apologized and said he shouldn't have put her on the spot like that He was just trying to think outside the box and come up with a quick solution to my phone not charging So he went to talk to the manager to see if she had any ideas In the mean time I went over to the display phones took the battery out and put it in my phone plugged it in and got the answer we needed It's the port not the battery I could hear the manager yelling at Davideveryone could He got yelled at for asking Gina to borrow her battery and for allowing me to take the battery out of a phone He didn't tell me to do it I did it all on my own since his co-workers and manager were completely worthless Since I purchased it at Costco ($70 cheaper plus awesome accessories) I had the option of having them send me a new one or just exchanging it at Costco I obviously went that route I called Verizon Customer Service today about my incident last night and they took it very seriously Especially since I had a billing error and the manager was supposed to correct it and she never did I highly commend David for doing whatever he could to help me Gina and the manager on duty were rude and absolutely worthless.
HORRIBLE customer service I don't expect a lot but I think a hello and how can I help you is in order when spending over $100 on dog food The price tag was missing off the shelf and the food wasn't ringing up so the boy working decided to just come up with a random amount higher than all the other bags in that size/brand around it  I shut that idea down quickly I was the only one in the store looking around for products and not one person asked if I needed help I will go back to my better mom and pop store that sells the same high end products Its further but better than having to deal with horrible sales people.
They make their pancakes with peanut oilWhich makes me sad because I'm allergic to peanutsSo yeah until they use something else I literally can't eat pancakes here.
Dynamite Paving is a Terrible Company Do not do business with this company They jack up contract prices by 50% My advice stay as far away as you can from these rip-off artists.
Now i recall why I haven't been here in so long: WAY over inflated prices  I got lured in with discount  cut-outs in mags coupons mailers - all in 1 mth so I thought hey why not take advanage of some money saving opportunity  Laura's (amazing) goat cheese was DOUBLE what you can purchase in Fresh & Easy (exaxct same amount & packaging $6 vs $3 - about a glof ball sz amount)  Did i mention all the moldy pitas in the bread section (Ewww)  Oh bought wine um the $60 kind - it was OFF  (when the cork almost falls out of the bottle dry clean there is your 1st clue)  The wine & liqours where so over-inflated it was unbelievable: ie: grey goose for $35 (always around $10 less at places like safeway & albertson's)  The high end wines (duck horn ect) 25% or more less at Phoenix Wine Also  I saw about only 5% of their wine that were actually on saleAt check out our discount was incorrect - we only saw in the car  Went back in for adjustment realized still incorrect After 3 tries they finally gave us the correct discount amount off $200 purchaseWill I be back  Even with several major discount coupons I could still use no way do I have any desire to return to this uppity over-priced estabishment.
From the street my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is we thought it would serve fast flavorful and good-quality lunch fare None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor In fact the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases quite gross We stopped in for lunch last week The place was packed but the line to order moved quickly so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly More on that in a second In terms of the menu we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option Even though I'm not a vegetarian I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta This is 2008 and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread In the end I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara We sat down at the table displayed our number card and just waited And waited And waited After literally waiting for 25 minutes I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter She went into the kitchen checked on our order and said it would be just a "few more minutes" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy but it was super-dry and totally gross Thanks but no thanks I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each sliceIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches If they can't handle the catering to-go and eat-in order volume they should hire more staff members As if the slow service wasn't painful enough my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black) After one bit of the accompanying slaw which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager handed her the plate and asked her to refund me for my plate To her credit she complied but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable The bread was a plain roll the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed and the "Greek" marinara tasted like Prego The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chipsI guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen We are huge fans of fast casual and fresh lunch food but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.
My young children love Panda Express orange chicken They eat it 2-4 times a month We were at the mall on a Saturday afternoon and stopped into the food court to have lunch The kids ordered the orange chicken and happily started to eat To our surprise it was spicy I noticed the color was a bit dark compared to normal but then I realized they must have mistakenly made it wrong They were adamant it was made correctly and wouldnt provide a refund It was completely inedible for my kids we had to throw it away and get them some pizza We're still deciding whether we'll be returning to any Panda Express but certainly never again to this one.
I had high hopes but stay away I've been here twice hoping my first try was a bad night for them As others have said the staff is not experienced not friendly and almost pissy that they are working We walked in and the bar tender just stared at me and my hub A patron had to tell us to find our own seat THENthere was a shard of glass in my margarita The manager handled it poorly Blamed dishwasherThe patio and decor are nice but staff ruin it Had to ask for every little thingnapkinstraw silverware etc seriously needs improvement bf ill spend money there again.
They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am  Won't be returning though the service was ok.
I use to shop at this place all the time But since they changed management and the way I was treated there was unacceptable The people there really need to have better customer service skills especially the Manager You will never see me there again and I usually drop $300 to $500 every visit But they don't care if you spend a $1 Asking for help is like pulling teeth.
I had been wanting to go to this restaurant since I moved to AZ I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day I had my hopes up but I wasn't really impressed  We were squeezed into a corner table the service was decent and it was quite noisy  I didn't feel that I was able to experience the vibe of the restaurant being in the corner I order pasta w/breadcrumbs/mushrooms and I ended up returning it It just didn't taste right Desert menu was a disappointment as well Overall I wouldn't recommend the restaurant.
As a loyal (former) patron of Harvey's Wineburger for over 40 years I can now announce that the change of ownership in the past year or so has murdered the magnet that kept customers coming back - their hamburgers  A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month and ask me to go there with him today  He said on his previous visit he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed  His assessment was quite accurateThe first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless rubbery and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years  Astonishingly you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen    We had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that "oriental owners" had taken over  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars  It's quite sad  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charmand hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town  Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation  Good luck with that I won't be back.
Really mediocre just plain jane boring sandwiches  They skimp on key ingredients like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had not fresh or nice tasting at all  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks "Art of Sandwicherie"  There is NO art going on here just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint  I will never be coming back there are much better alternatives  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out  What a disappointment.
I was looking forward to checking this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp  It's decorated in a beach theme and seems like a fun atmosphereI sat at the bar and it took a little while to get my menu  I ordered the bacon cheeseburgerAnd then I waited  And I waited  A half hour after I sat down at the bar I still didn't have any food  I put a couple bucks on the bar for my Sprite and walked out.
In my experience I found her not to have the level of knowledge and expertise expected  Suspect either poor listening or poor comprehension skills as she researches and answers questions not asked while failing to respond to those actually asked then charges both meeting time and research timeInitially found her to be basically competent in elementary tax matters (ie turbo tax or other software might do just as well) but would suggest seeking expertise elsewhere if your situation has any degree of complexity or variance to vanilla 1040.
If it were not for the bloody mary and mimosa specialsthere would be no reason to step foot in the new Pischkes (and still I would rather go pay $7 for a mimosa where there is some atmosphere and good food What a shame this used to serve the best breakfast in town and have an hour waitpeople enjoyed having a cocktail at the bar and running into friendsnow it is pretty much seat yourself and enjoy a limited menu  HINT:  Mr McGrath bring back the old menu and foodI love the Roaring Fork and eat there twice a month but this place used to be the best breakfast joint in townbring back the old Pischke's please.
Rude rude rude rude rude rude how can a general manager be so RUDE and keep her job No wonder Pizza Hut has gotten bad reviews and ratings They sold me someone else's order and then when mine is ready they expect me to pay for it alsoWTF Get real people Not even worth the one star rating we are forced to give.
Save your money The food is bland The pollo and carne asada are tough and full of gristle I've given it many chances and each time they get my order wrong Bland bland bland.
I decided to try the new ice place "Scooptacular" Let me say this was not a good experience I wasted my time and money First the customer service was the worst Sorry to say it Jennifer but I repeated my order four times Wow and the order was still wrongThere are only a few regular flavors Can you believe no regular vanilla ice creamTwo sundaes cost $864 which is ridiculus considering the size of this sundae was a six ounce plastic glass The whip cream was not sweet I don't think it was real The hot fudge was the only good thing on the sundae and it was scarce Oh and by the way used spoons should never be next to clean utensils I almost picked up a used oneDon't waste your time Although I support local businesses this one needs lots of work.
I was expecting this place to be a nice resort  The place is kind of newly established because it was really hard to find this place in the evening  There are no signs if you come from the back and there is a lot of construction going onAlthough they make an effort for it to look nice my room was facing a trailer park and some desolate houses   It seems like it's at the edge of town  Not to mention there was a sign on my hotel door that said to use the double bolted lock at night  The bed was okay the sheets could and blanket could have been more luxurious  Good thing I got free internet because I was there on businessThey put me in the building furthest from the lobby so it took about 5 minutes to walk there  I didn't get a sense of it being safe if I walked there at night  They had no express checkout so I tried checking out using their television  That also didn't work and when I called the front desk about three times nobody picked up  I just left anyways because I didn't want to be late for my flightThe only good thing is that they give free bottled water in the room  But before you get excited it's just crappy cheap water nothing nice  Oh and there is a Starbucks if you'd like to walk all the way to the lobby again  I was dissapointed and frankly I would rather stay somewhere else next time.
Went in to have my ankle looked at after experiencing a lot of pain and some swelling While I was waiting in the room I could hear the doctor say "we sure do have some needy patients today don't we" Somebody needs to learn that those walls aren't sound proof  It took about 20 minutes for the doctor to finally see me and when she did all she did was move my ankle around with her foot and told me there was nothing wrong She didn't even have me remove my shoe to really inspect it I will never go here again.
Terrible Apparently Robert purchased Rosa's (in 2008 or prior) and is now the owner I took in a BCBG formal gown to have the sides taken in bra cups sewn in a clasp fixed and the hem shortened less than an inch The dress was purchased from Last Chance but was in PERFECT condition when I took it to him The clasp was sewn in upside down the sides were bunching and not smooth at all and the hem was completely crooked One side of the dress was two inches shorter than the other side He did not take ownership of his mistakes at all Kept saying "It's not my fault someone else sewed the hem crooked I took an inch off all the way around" He did not pin the hem all the way around to make sure it would be even and he cut the excess material off so there was no way for it to be fixed Awful A gorgeous dress completely ruined for my brother's wedding He said it would be done Monday and I called to ensure it was ready for pick up He said "I have a few more things to do on it" A few more things turned out to be everything He had just started working on it and didn't even provide a courtesy call that it would be late I tried it on the next day and found the horrible results 10 days before the wedding and I now have to find a new dress which will most likely need alterations I will not be going to Rosa's (Robert).
8 days later - 2 emails plus call to the number associated with their DNS - as the number on the website is disconnected They're gone and so is our money For those who said nice things about the owner well let's just say Ive got a different perspective of him We made an appointment twice only to have it cancelled twice due to "staffing" issues Then they were gone Seems like a very dishonest person he knew what he was doing and I call it fraudulent  I suspect he was dragging it out so that the charge would be in for a hard dispute with the credit card companyAnd this guy taught law enforcement over at University of Phoenix.
Don't DO IT They ARE HORRIBLE Stay Away LOOKS are deceiving.
The best thing I can say was that the food was good  Then it went down hill from there  The hostess scowled at us when we asked for a booth  The waitress never smiled  When the food arrived (there were three of us there) all we could do was gasp and laugh at the puny portions  Then when the bill arrived - we were still hungry and it was $60 for lunch  On the upside the manager was called over and they brought out some extra food to 'make up' for the small portions at no charge  That would have put our lunch total to $90 for the three of us   Eek Me thinks not  I will never go back there  Oh yea we arrived at 11 am on Monday and got the last parking place  For me the Yard is totally ridiculous.
This restaurant is the BIGGEST JOKE  The portion sizes are extremely small and you will leave hungry After spending $20000 my husband and I had to go somewhere else to get something to eat A gentlemen in the restroom even commented to my husband that he didn't get much to eat and was still hungry Trust us go somewhere else Biggest disappointment of our dining experiences.
This used to be one of my fav places for good home-style Italian dining Especially for a late night dinner --because the kitchen stayed open much later than other restaurants in Phoenix I had heard that there were new owners and I am very disappointed   The very stingy serving of bread is plain and ordinary and forget about getting seconds The Alfredo sauce is bland -- like maybe it was from a can  The pasta was over-cooked and reheated to slightly above room temperature The service is so-so   Sad.
I have been to  Boston's twice - once on a weekday afternoon and a Friday during happy hour - and both times have I been grievously disappointed I am not especially picky about my eateries so long as they serve good food the place can look as dumpy as is permissable for satisfactory health inspection I am readily forgiving of flummoxed trainees the occasional forgotten condiment and the typical slowness of service during peak hours I respect people in positions to cater to my incessant hunger and possible alcoholism and I show this by accepting them for their occasional shortcomingsThat being said: Boston's is not forgiven The first time I came here upon the recommendation of a trusted friend we experienced downright sluggish service It was a Tuesday afternoon with nary a soul in the house save our two-person party and our rough-looking server couldn't be bothered to take our order in a timely fashion She argued with my friend and overcharged him for his beer then refused to pay us any mind after our food had been delivered Another seemingly more pleasant server noticed we'd been biding our time drinkless and fetched us our refills We overheard a catty exchange between the two women as Server of the Year swept past which told us right away that this lack of hospitality was not atypical of this potential ex-con that had taken our orderFlash forward to last Friday: despite having been underwhelmed by my maiden voyage to Boston's I ventured in again - this time in a party of three - only to wait awkwardly in the entryway for an upward of five minutes until someone emerged to seat us This 'someone' was exactly that - a seemingly random untagged man who could just as easily have been the general manager as some drunk at the bar  We were not given a choice of where to sit - a huge faux pas for any joint serious about its service Instead we were escorted into the bar/lounge area and instructed to sit at the awkward high table just around the corner from the bar When asked if we could be relocated to a booth we were refused the opportunityAt a spritely 5'2" I don't fare well in chairs that sit over half my height off the ground and the space behind me was an uncomfortable flurry of movement to-and-from the kitchen Even at our easily accessible high-traffic location we were not offered so much as a glass of water We waited twenty minutes to be acknowledged in a near-empty bar well into the range of happy hour before abandoning our table and walking out As an added insult the entire exit was blocked by the man who'd seated us and a few identifiable employees We brushed passed effectively interrupting their conversation and the guy - more than likely the actual manager as opposed to an inebriated managerial impersonator - said nonchalantly "Oh hey guys everything all right""Yeah" I muttered as I followed my stoic companions outside Apparently he had wax in his ears because he poked his little head out after us and asked again a bit sternly "Guys Everything all right"I snapped "Yes" - the tone of which translated to: "No jackass everything isn't all right" But it wasn't worth arguing: we were parched hungry and too irate to be rational I've heard great things about Boston's but have yet to experience one I can chalk up a few mistakes to human error and the nature of the restaurant industry but the inattentiveness and general lack of hospitality demonstrated by the largely uncaring staff is too blatantly disrepectful to warrant a third shot.
Arrived with a large group - You can almost see the $$ signs in the waiters and wine steward eyes  The wine suggested was a great producer but in no way fit to be drank  It was a huge bottle that needed to be moved and we bought in  The waiter did not even notice the spilled sauces on the table the crumbs in every corner or that  silverware for next course was not all placed  Too bad I had to ask my neighbor for her knife  No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks  Food was OK  But service was offal I prefer a quick serve restaurant that notices a detail or to  Did I mention the 18% on an $800 dollar check  I think I will celebrate some place else next time.
My son ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken along with the Shrimp Fried Rice which he enjoyed  My husband was not impressed with the Broccoli Beef  While I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and the Hot and Spicy Lamb  The Hot and Sour Soup was mediocre I've had much better and the Hot and Spicy Lamb was extremely greasy  The quality of the meals is not what will keep up us from coming back  It was the fact that as we were waiting for our check my son noticed a cockroach next to my husband's shoe on the floor Which brought our attention to the reminder of the dining room floor and we saw another one  Totally gross.
I had to pick up a bunch of things from Smart and Final today and I knew I wouldn't have any other time to stop for lunch so I walked into Papaya Thai to get a Pad Thai to goIt was about 11:45am when I walked in and there isn't a soul around and even though it's pushing 100 degrees outside somehow it's even hotter in here plus somehow humid and musty on top of it  If I was planning to eat in I would have left right then and thereSo I ring the bell they had on the counter (seems having no one up front is common) and a guy comes out and takes my order the Pad Thai lunch special to go  I go to Smart and Final and by the time I get my stuff loaded up my lunch is ready and I leaveI didn't pay particular attention to what the lunch special included but the only thing in the box beside the Pad Thai is a little sickly spring roll that was obviously bought premade frozen and fried off  It was innocuous enoughThe pad thai however was a different story  For some reason it was packed in a little tin foil pouch  While I had asked for a 35 out of 5 on the heat scale this was maybe a 2  No lime no real discernable flavor not even a pair of chopsticks in the bag  There was a little chicken in there and it was very tender but I suspect it is because of how thinly it is sliced rather than any cooking skillMost disturbingly there were these hard unchewable inedible pieces of something (egg shell) throughoutWould never ever go back  Especially when Beaver Choice an actual indie joint with some talent is just on the other side of the center.
Tricky pricing Only worthwhile if you buy items on sale and have coupons.
You know that feeling the one that feels like you could get mugged while walking through an airport  Yeah that one.
Recently my Sam's Club membership under my former business expired and I was contemplating renewing on my own I had pretty much decided to renew once payday came around since I've been a member for 7 years and haven't had too many issues with the storeToday however changed my mind and I will be activating a membership with Costco I had purchased 4 brand new tires from Sam's Club last February About a week ago I noticed that my tire was low so I put air in it Then a few days later it was low againso I knew it needed to be fixed Without hesitation I drove to Sam's Club to have the auto center fix it since it was a tire I had purchased from there less than one year agoI run in to get out of the rain with my 4 month old baby and approach the service person at the counter who was definitely not wanting to be working or something didn't even greet me and acted like I was bothering him I tell him the scenario and he scans my Sam's Club card Of course it didn't come up since my membership has expired and I haven't had a chance to renew yet Immediately he informs me he can't help me and that's it So I say "But I bought the tire from you Really You're going to send a woman with a baby back out to drive in a downpour with a flat tire not even offering to put air in it" The utter disregard was unbelievableSo there you have it I cannot fathom doing business with a company with such horrible customer service.
OVERRATED OVERRATED OVERRATEDThey've done a bang-up job of public relations and convincing the trendy sheep that this is the equivalent of a pizza orgasm Hmph It's OK not great but it's not like there aren't other wood-fired pizza joints in PhoenixBy the way I know real Italian pizza I eat it regularly In Italy So don't give me crap about 'go eat at Domino's you don't know good pizza' I do Believe me I cook Italian (tuscan) regularlyPizzeria Bianco approaches traditional Italian pizza so I'd ordinarily give it 3 stars However I downgraded it to one due to the rude rude rude service and how incredibly overpriced it isGotta hand it to Bianco though he's got a good scam going I mean he's really got it figured out Hype the shit out of the place bribe/suck up to all the restaurant reviewers who convince the sheeple that you gotta go here if you're 'somebody' brown-nose the local celebrity crowd into coming there (I'm sure they get treated much differently than us peons) make the restaurant too small and get people to spend money at your wine bar while enduring the insane wait for a table Fucking brilliant.
My company uses this Enterprise on a weekly basis  We need a car each Tuesday Wednesday and every other Thursday  Since October they have been on time only twice  When they are late our schedule is affected and we must use our own vehicle.
"Hey Kerstin Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner Didn't you just eat out""Yeah but we ate at Miracle Mile"'Nuf said really but our experience was such an epic fail I must elaborate a bit This was Hubby's suggestion mind you and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options After a lunch of Peter Piper however even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust What he got was an overly peppered dried out square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste crunch or flake to it It had that speckled look that old pastry gets If this is what a knish is supposed to be then they nailed itI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread What is this 1950 At least it wasn't Wonder Bread It was wheat I had asked for sour dough when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially There were The manager "saved" me by correcting his employee about the caraway only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register "Why don't you like caraway" she asked I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied "I really don't like the taste" When she asked me "Why" a second time you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment Anyway the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the "sauce" was totally canned and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese It was also not to temp The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that "real" texture Foul foul foul Hence the grilled cheese.
Service was horrible Need to teach servers how to turn tables prebus etc.
I Love Greek Salad my wife picked up a large Greek Salad for us to split and we were both very disappointed Our idea of a Greek Salad as opposed to others is mainly ample Feta Cheese and several Greek olives We each had an olive (like in 1 each) oh well The Feta seemed to be sprinkled from a salt shaker with half the holes plugged up The rest of the salad that is the normal parts was fine but the entire salad was somewhat small for a large We may be back but it won't be for the salad.
After two visits - terrible  Cochinita Pibil tacos dry and tasteless  And with French fries  Guacamole should be advertised as chopped (at least as well as you can with a spoon by a server who told us it was a pain to do guacamole tableside when it was busy) avocado not guacamole  Service seemed just plain uninterested  Prices not justified at all for what you are going to experience.
This was a terrible experience  I am a regular Target shopper and was returning three small items that were less than $5 total  Two of the items were not coming up on their computer but were clearly showing on my receipt for $105  The two service associates acted helpless dumbfounded and definitely not empowered  They continuously asked me if i had another receipt  After I screamed at them that it was ridiculous to put me through this for $2 they gave me a cash refund-for less than I paid  I am still annoyed I can't believe retail has sunken to this level of stupidity.
I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix so I go to the 20th St & Camelback Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT They are clean the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done  What is it with the Camelback crowd  The place really smells bad It really needs a good cleaning There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off I swear he was sweating like a pig left the equipment drenched UGH  Good God I couldn't believe it Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front deskthey should be cleaning something anything  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue Maybe then they may clean up their act.
I got one piece of pumpkin bread and a plain iced coffee $711 7/11 is where I should've went I could get a jackolantern to deliver pumpkin bread and blow out my candle for that price This place is going in Lil Bootsy's litterbox.
Horrible cuts of meat weird almost sour after taste of chicken like its been sitting out for a while For being in an oriental/asian plaza i thought the quality would be higher I was wrong not ever going back BE WARNED.
We went here three times in the last 6 months each time hoping it would be better and more like the location on Indian School and Dysart where we had previously visited It wasn't I got a combo platter each time and each time parts of the plate were literally unedible The tamale was overcooked to death The chile rellano had nothing in it and was dried out And for over $8 it should be much better than thatThe last time my husband complained of an upset stomach that night and next day We will not return to this location.
Recently 'redecorated' All beauty and charm has been surgically removed The banquets thick green comfortable replaced with wooden slate chairs and rickety tables to match The tasteful gating removed Replaced with what appears to be giant tire rims with tiny fruit trees I am totally over all fox restaurants They can't even be trusted to redecorate without wrecking the place Bloom is fugly as can be The managers are good at apologizing which is good- they will doing plenty of it  Their new menu ideas are equally bad I can see their getting ready to go public buyer beware this chain is over.
Average burger old fries and a sad excuse of a milkshake Although the restaurant was super slow the store was very dirty and the employees didn't even bother with it as they preferred to help themselves to free drinks as they conversed amongst themselves.
This place is right if you like getting your face kicked in or being raped in the parking lot with a screw driver check it out.
HORRIBLE SERVICEWe can't go back there Went there for the first time tonight and was expecting great food We walked in no one came up to greet us Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude We picked a table and sat down They were slow to give us our menus We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade The absolute worst was when we went up to pay they never handed us a bill and overcharged us The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him just spat out a number "$3316" without doing any kind of math He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash he barked "Didn't you see the sign We take cash" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off Their signage is confusing There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said "we are now accept credit and debit cards" Also the place is filthy Dirty floors walls and windows The bathroom smells like hot ass For some reason the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does Absolute worst We've had great food and service at Lolo's They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed I love the servers at Lolo's they are attentive friendly and helpful I can't believe the two families are related WE WILL NEVER GO BACK.
Had heard good things about Churchill's but was very disappointed on my first visitWent with family to celebrate a birthday dinner at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon There were only two other parties in the place  In spite of the dead slow time the waitress refused to help us split up a check ("You ordered appetizers and those are too hard to split" Huh) and seemed relatively uninterested in us most of the time we were thereI wasn't super hungry so asked to get the lunch portion of the Bangers & Mash after she talked about their homemade sausages She said I couldn't do that on a weekend but I'd want the dinner portion anywayThat dinner portion had a pile of fairly tasty homemade potatoes but only three halves of sausages  Not three sausages three HALVES cut lengthwise So 1 1/2 bangers for a dinner portion  That's not banging that's barely mild thumping And they were curled up from being overcooked They seemed like they could have been tasty had they been cooked decentOh and the dinner special fried chicken  All out for the day At 3:30  Seems like if you're going to run a dinner special and have it on your special's board you should I dunno HAVE the special in the kitchen somewhereMy Guinness was also flat when I got it and as I think about it I started this review with two stars but I'm going down to one  An English pub that can't nail a Guinness and Bangers & Mash might want to rethink their priorities I haven't been this disappointed in a pub in a long time and I won't be back  Blech.
I would never recommend living in this apartment place I've lived in several wonderful apartments throughout downtown Phoenix and Tempe but never have I experienced such a terrible living situation as I have at Mill Pointe Aparments Here are the reasons why:1 constant crime area: gunshots homeless walk freely through the property grounds strangers/possible harmful individuals knocking on your door pretending to be servicemen police constantly driving through but never actually doing anything etc when coming home at night time ive noticed plenty of clearly ODD people sneaking around the parking lot looking through cars in one instance i saw a man that lived in an apartment at mill pointe chasing after a man with a mask claiming he was looking through the windows of his home watching his family2 mgmt company: every time i have called them for a work order or alterations to my lease or any kind of question the manager of the complex is ALWAYS "out in a meeting" and/or unavailable no matter when i call morning noon or evening after becoming upset about this recurring problem i called and once again they told me jennifer the manager was in a meeting so i walked down to the offices and there was jennifer in her office alone with the door shut (i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours3 the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in flies and gnats everywhere my neighbor had told me upon her moving in her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet4 work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice i nor did most of my connecting neighbors have hot water for over 48 hours MULTIPLE TIMESI called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportantAll other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above STAY AWAY.
Horrible  Dirty run down the employees didn't know their butt fromwell you know  The taco meat had NO flavor I told the kid behind the counter and he just looked at us with his mouth hanging open and shrugged his shoulders  There were flies everywhere The floors were dirty  Both restrooms were filthy ( and for my husband to say a men's bathroom is bad it has to be bad) Never ever have I had such an icky taco bell experience  Will go back to stoping at Carl's jr or jack in the box on the way thru town  Icky Just icky.
Again it really does pain me to give low stars but my experience there was quite terribleNOTE: I tried Katana several times in 2010 (when I first moved here) and wanted to see if they were new-and-improved in 2013 For me they've gotten worseI was craving sushi one night so I called for take-out of salmon sashimi Philly roll and Rainbow roll The girl who took my order (Brittany) said it would be ready in 25 min Okay - great See you thenI gave them 30 minutes (just in case they were slammed) Showed up and Brittany seemed a little flustered and kept apologizing that my order wasn't ready and made a quick phone call Okayyy Mind you - no one is sitting in the dining area No oneAfter 5 or 10 min a couple of patrons came in and were seated Still not readyMore time elapsed and the sushi chef (don't know his name) came through the main entrance w/a box of food Thought I caught a glimpse of cucumber and perhaps other veggies More time elapsedChef apologized to me and said "5 more minutes" - I nodded and smiled Finally order came out (WAYYYY over-priced too)After about an hour wait (total) the sushi was quite disgusting - I must say Way too salty and it just tasted "warm" in some wierd way Salmon sashimi was pretty decent - good cuts and okay quality That was the only thing I finishedWill not be returning here in the near future - but I still have hopes for this place to turn itself around.
Sure their branding is nice It has that feel of something hip and youthful which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palateI can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's Fresh vegetables grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk Instead their food is BLAND It is the inverse of food it is anti-food annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite.
They advertise "you don't need no teeth to eat our meat" Well yes you do I bought a full rack of baby backs and couldn't wait to get home with them They were VERY tough and had very little meat on them.
Where are you people eating pizza and claiming this is the best you have tasted Its bland with a tough crust The sauce has no resemblance to an italian pizza taste There wasnt 1 drop of oil anywhere to be found Rosatis and Casanovas kill this pizza and they are not exceptional Also a brick oven can only do so much A traditional pizza oven is the way to go In a nutshell this is over priced crappy pizza.
Please know that this is a DOG FRIENDLY restaurant  Even when the dog is aggressive or interfering with other customers they have preference over the humans My husband and my young son sat on the patio to enjoy the gorgeous weather  Unfortunately a couple with a huge hyperactive Pitt Bull sat next to them The dog kept bumping into my son's chair and even lunged at a waiter When my husband politely asked them if they could control their dog he was told that he shouldn't have brought his "kid to a dog friendly restaurant"  Management was no help (maybe because one of the waitresses was friends with the couple-she kept sitting with them) so my husband and son had to leave (no available seats inside)  So we'll take their advise and never eat here again.
Worst sushi Ive had in Arizona The egg drop soup was old and tasted like feet Then our sushi took almost an hour and tasted like it had been sitting the whole time The sushi was so bad after one bite I was afraid to eat anymore for fear of getting sick At this point I told the waitress about how bad it was and all they did was drop a bill I will never eat there again and recommend nobody else does Ever.
My daughter went here and ordered the sampler platter and is highly allergic to shrimp she asked to subsitute it for something else and they said no  They could put it on the side  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to  This is a scary thought  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus  This is there company policy.
If I could give this zero stars I wouldThis was the worst experience I have ever had from a server  To begin with the busboy brought our silverware and menus out right away (A+)  Then it went downhill from hereWhen our server Aubrey finally did show up she asked us for our drink order and we told her were actually ready to order  This did not matter to Aubreyshe took our drink order and said she'd be back for our food order when she could write it down  Okayshe brought back our sodas and we order our burgers  Mine was ordered medium and my wife ordered hers well doneSome time later when the food arrived we asked for some sliced picklesthey never showed up until we asked the busboy to bring them to us I guess Aubrey was too busy helping everyone else to get our measly picklesNow I think well done has a universal meaning of cooked all the way through  Aubrey may have had the chance to fix this if she ever stopped back by to check on us but she did not  During this time we observed Aubrey checking on other patrons but we somehow escaped her attention  I was tempted to ask her what we did to upset her but she never came back to our tableWe finally flagged her down to get our check it took way too long to prepare  To give you an idea of how bad the service was the bill was $2482 I left $25I asked to speak to the manager and David came out and introduced himself as the owner and I explained to him what had happened  He introduced his wife to me and asked her to get me a gift card for the amount of my check  He was extremely apologetic about the service we receivedA few minutes later I was out the door with my gift card (which I did not want in the first place)My wife was waiting outside (that's how upset she was) and when I told her what had happened she took the gift card and was going to return it to him and let him know that's not what we wantedAs we were walking back in we spotted a homeless gentleman and offered the gift card to him as we had no intention of EVER returningMy wife went in to explain to the owners what she had done with the gift card and the homeless gentleman followed us in and was going to order some foodWe left and as we were pulling out the parking lot the homeless man informed us that David had taken the gift card away from him and told him it was not valid and that if he didn't leave he was going to call the policeWowreally  Unbelievablewe will never return and I sincerely hope anyone reading this will think twice before patronizing an establishment that treats people this way.
I don't know all the details exactly but I was just in there the other day and it appeared that they were having a routine health inspection and I didn't mention it at the time but there were a few roaches walking around  Looks now like the health inspector shut them down for 2 weeks or something like that  Gross.
This place sucks bad food and over priced you can you get better steaks at Texas Road House and for half the price I would never eat here again.
Carefree Resortnot my choice  I can "care less" about this place  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly  I hope I won't be returning.
WowSorry Charlie's I have to give you a star even though you don't deserve anySeems as though you cannot bring a bag in larger than an average bank deposit bag Your rude doorman made that perfectly clear Strange you're right on the light rail Locals will be carrying messenger bags backpacks purses as they use this form of transportation No worries though There are plenty of other welcoming bars along or close to the light rail lineYee Haw.
This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty the happy hour cocktail was great and the edamame was perfectly salted And even though our server was a newbie she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu QsUnfortunately none of this matters because I got food poisoning I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken Worst 48 hours of my life I'll never return.
I have been here for dim sum couple times good service and good food BUT a recent visit to Phoenix Palace gave me a brand new view about this place My friend and I had 2 waters and 6 dim sum items When the bill came we noticed an item on the bill says "2 guests: $170" When we asked the server why she replied "we charge money for water"  This restaurant CHARGES $085 for every water they give out to customer This is not bottle water simply water from the tap in a plastic cup For this reason I will NOT return to this place there are plenty other dim sum places in town will gladly provide free water to customers like any other restaurant in AZ.
Undergoing cancer treatment is difficult  Undergoing cancer treatment at Ironwood Cancer & Research Center is HELL  We were on time for our appointment and still waited 2 hours for the infusion  The infusion center was overflowing with patients  Family members had no where to sit  The nurses constantly bumped into me and asked me to move as they tried to maneuver through the aisle A treatment that was supposed to last 2 hours lasted 5   We are leaving Ironwood and I would never recommend it  Ardon the infusion nurse is especially rude.
I thought I drove into another countrya third world countrya sketchy third world country when I pulled off the 10 real quick  I won't let my wife go here alone day or night.
I wouldn't recommend this place paid 25 for a pedicure lamest one I've ever received top coat and base coat didn't cover the whole nail and was raised at cuticle the next next day The chairs are not comfortable.
MY EXPERIENCE: We take a seat at a table in the corner  It wasn't set so a busser brings our water & utensils she is carrying the end of the utensils we're about to put in our mouth  There is hair in my water  Dude takes the water away saying yeah that's gross (he didn'tapologise)  My hash brown layer concoction was awful  Felt like I was eating plastic tasted like it too eggs were rubbery & only two small strips of bacon  My companions chicken fried steak wasn't bad though they forgot to bring his side of corn beef hash proceed to bring him hash browns and then the corn beef hash  He was done with his food before they brought either of them out  The gentleman in the back putting butter in the pans wasn't wearinggloves (the other cooks were) and picks up a piece of butter he dropped yip with his hands  Our server sits at the bar near us & inhales his food quite a sight  No one asked how our meal was  He brings us our check my full plate of food is sitting right there still doesn't ask us about our meal  We ask for a to go box my companion looks inside and it's got an oil puddle and oops some MORE hair  We pay and run out of there  I personally am too afraid of going back there in the fear of I might 'catch' something but then again maybe it was a combination of my bad luck and a bad day for them.
Got a burrito from the grill then hit the road half way through it I discover the tortilla was moldy.
While I do not eat fast food as much I used to I used to eat at Jack in the Box (different locations) all of the time  I was on my way home recently from playing sports and had a hankering for a sourdough jack (my favorite) and some jalapeno poppers  My girlfriend was with me and decided to try the sirloin burger  What a disasterWe were exhausted and live close by so we went straight home after hitting the drive through only to find out that we did not receive the poppers that we paid for  On top of that the burgers were sub par and the fries were burnt (a shame because they were curly fries)  I had not eaten at JITB in quite some time and this experience has solidified why I had stopped going in the first place  Perhaps I should have checked the bag before leaving the drive through but when there are only a couple of cars in the drive through and no one in the restaurant should I really have to  Especially at 10pm when things are slow  I will not be returning to this location and more than likely will not return to any others either  It is a shame because the food used to be so good.

As you may have read the "tip" you already know our experience was one of the saddest we have had since moving to the valley So much so that I created this yelp account just to express how terrible it was Is the food good Don't know It never arrived after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito Is the beer (hefe) good No At least the first 10oz weren'tNever had waiter come back to try anything else Poor service reflects poor management("louie" sp) very pricey and in no way a brewery in my eyes Steer clear and try Sun Up brewery instead Waaay better beer food and outstanding service Might give osho another shot someday when I'm not hungry or thirsty or have something to do or awake Hope this helps fellow yelpers Oh ya and if you're a blonde stripper/escort driving a fancy Mercedes you'll get valet to park it right at the door priority order service and skip the valet wait line at pick up Now that's a classy jointUPDATE Contacted by actual manager the day after posting seeking resolution That's a big deal in my book Looking forward to returning and giving OHSO another tryStay tuned for the next update.
First time to this location I "usually" go to one of 3 other locations  I was doing take-out  Got in line only 1 person in front of me  It took this lady quite a while - several minutes - to decide what she wanted  There was one other person running the line but she was busy with other customers already ahead  When she finally got this person's order and got it completely done - versus handing it off to the next person in line like at other Panda Express's she got a drive-thru order coming through her headphones so she started preparing THAT person's food who hadn't waited at all simply because they were in the drive-thru That person disappeared to the window area  Meanwhile the other now-lone attendant was finally finished with the other customers and came back to take my order AT this point there were 7 other people behind me yet no sign in sight of anyone to come help with this mess I get around the glass case only to find my favorite Kung Pao Chicken is all out  Gag  So if I want it I have to wait  Well they said it would be "right up" so I waited  The attendant took care of every other single person in line including getting their orders and operating the cash register - which took her quite a while - and they STILL hadn't gotten any chicken out there  I sat down at a table now watching no customers at all in line  I've been there going on 20 minutes now for a take out order  When they finally came out with the chicken I then went to the condiment counter and found they were out of mustard  How many more ways can this visit turn South  I ask the lady to get more  She does not ask me how many I wanted but comes back with 4  I like hot mustard I would have taken 6 or 7 if the dispenser would have been stocked  I was offered nothing in "compensation" for the extremely long wait for a food item that I have NEVER seen any other Panda Express out of - Kung Pao Chicken that is -because that's one of their favorite sellers They hadn't even started to prepare any more until I got up there looking for someI have NEVER experienced this kind of pathetic service at any of the other 3 Panda Express's I go to -- well I have been to even more on a one-time basis simply because of being in an area that I don't normally go to and eating there such as the one in Casa Grande  This isn't going to cause' me to ban Panda Express not at all but it IS going to cause me to NEVER come to this particular location againEdited: I called corporate to see if I could get a freebie out of it and I unabashedly tell you that yes they offered me one and yes I am getting it via USPS  The person on the phone was not liking hearing about the fact that there was no Kung Pao Chicken despite the fact that there were 2 cooks working in the back  I won't be using the freebie at that location however.
I stopped in on a Friday night because a friend of mine wanted to go here While this establishment is full of dating couples matchcom people and just out for a night I decide to order the Pizza Sauce Bloody Mary I have seen this made before and it is a beautiful beverage In the menu the description says house cucumber lime vodka or Chinaco Silver Estate Tequila ( which would be a Bloody Maria I think) salt and pepper rim Antipasti skewer and celery bitters We all know Bloody Mary's come with celery and olives I was served olives and a normal Bloody Mary mix as apparently Tanzy ran out of supplies The drink is not pretty like I have seen before and when I address the situation the bartender said "we are out of everything we got slammed on Sunday" Are you effin kidding me It's Friday You mean to tell me in five days time nobody could make it to a store or get a delivery My level of disappointment is shocking I dine in almost every restaurant in this area The Scottsdale Quarter is very trendy relatively expensive and has the ability to host so many people Having said that to give such a lame excuse for a patron bringing up a poorly made beverage is sad Being that Scottsdale insists on charging $1000 for a Bloody Mary I expect a sexy beverage that I have seen in the past Consistency is key in this industry When you wonder why Eddie V's is alive well  it's because they try very hard to have a great guest experience Good thing you guys have IPic money to support you.
Boiled down: I found something I wanted on their site but went to the store to look at it in person and to browse aroundWhen I got there I noticed that the price online was lower than in-store -- and confirmed it via my phoneI asked the cashier nicely and they refused to price-match (two whole bucks) So I asked to see the "manager" who was mind-blowingly rude and unhelpful No apology offered - totally the opposite - and she essentially said they won't price match the web and they have lower prices on their site because they gouge you with shipping and "handling" fees etc (Super bitchy about it all) So I left and spent my money elsewhereAfter about a month (cooling-off period) I finally wrote Cost Plus' home office about that horrible manager person plus to suggest that they say something on their site (like Home Depot etc do) informing customers that in-store prices may not be the same yadda Never heard anything back from them at all Conclusion: They could not care less (Also know that this is a store I have been going to since I was a little kid -- they're from the Bay Area) Therefore I'll never set foot in Cost Plus again and hope to enlighten others about their crappy business practices :P It's not about the two dollars -- it's about the total disrespect for their customersEspecially in this economy good service is SO important (As is fair pricing).
Picked up dinner with my mom on 8/28/13 The chicken nachos had a very long piece of black hair in them She pulled it out right before my eyes Totally repulsive She called the restaurant & the guy offered to remake them When she explained we lived about 30 minutes away and no one felt like eating chicken nachos anymore not even an offer of a refund Didn't even seem concerned that employees were sending out food with their hair in it Gross.
I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded1 Space: first of all this place is really really really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort  I recommend small party with 4 people max2 Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available3 Quality: not so great my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy I myself is not a big fan of Fat4 Beverage: uh I rather go to Circle K and get a cup5: Service: ok but for such a limited customers how can service go wrongAll in all I was not impress with this place  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about but once again I very disappointed  BTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.
Rediculous Was told there would be a 25 min wait which was hard with our special need twins but instead we waited over 45 minutes meanwhile 2 tops were walking in & being seated spoke to the "manager" who was rude & wasn't willing to put 2 tops together Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait & attitude you can get breakfast anywhere.
Oh Upper Deck Let me count the ways in which you are lame:- You have a $25 minimum for credit cards Ayesha assures me that this is a standard thing yet I've lived in the quintessential college town for 15 years and I've never even heard of anything so egregious I mean we drank well over $25 but still lame- A server never even looked at us Not once- Your clever little 'Balls to the Wall' mural has a hockey puck in it  Puck not ball- Your food appears to be from large industrial size bags that sit frozen until the need to deep fry/microwave them arises  Keep in mind I have almost zero standards for food- And honestly I drug my girlfriend here because it is supposedly a 'Michigan' bar and we were going to watch Michigan basketball  I was willing to overlook just about anything - I just wanted to watch them play with like minded fans  But seriously its 2009 and you DON'T HAVE HD You are a sports bar  HD was practically created for you  OK Michigan won and they played the fight song over the speakers in the bar that was cool and I was happy for it being so far from home that's worth one star But under normal circumstances why anyone would ever come here to watch sports is completely beyond me.
Total sports bar borderline dive bar and it has been around foEVA  I get that many patrons feel that it is an institution but really it's just a burger joint that caters to a bunch of alcoholics and has crappy service from pretty much everyone who works the barRude lazy pron to ignore you on a regular basis Or don't want to wait on you because they are going off shift in like 20minutes   Are you effing kidding me with this  Take my firkin order and treat me like the paying customer that I amChristI go here from time to time because I work at the local college and my friends and colleagues like to go after work because it's close and I don't want to be difficult so I go alongI for whatever reason am no longer a beer drinker but I try and keep it low maintenance because I know these types of bartenders don't like to make cocktails and I really don't want any enemies  So I order a vodka and club soda with extra lime because  I figure it's easy and I don't care for tonic  Yeah well apparently this can't be done well because the club soda is ALWAYS flat and the drink tastes like crappy vodka and tap water  So I asked how the club soda was on this particular visit and they said much better since the fireI was hopeful didn't quite get why the fire might have fixed the problem but hopeful nonetheless  But no it was the same shitty flat water and I hated to have to send it back because I knew this dude was gong to give attitude because that's how he do  Hell he was doin that when he told me the fire helped the waterdick really and so unnecessaryYup attitude took the drink back and I settled for a glass of wine equally difficult to drink but I just shut up about it and smile  Then we were ignored until I actually had to ask him a third time to take our food orderI wouldn't call myself a regular but they recognize me in there and I know them by name  My colleagues know the staff far better than I but either way why be shitty to customers who are trying to be cool and not too difficult   And honestly who would like to sip a beverage that reminds her that she too could be homeless and filtering rubbing alcohol through a sock  WHY Hamburger Works staff is it OK with you to be rude and lame to your customers  Oh I know you don't like people who expect you to do your job like wipe off the food debris left on the table and booths  Maybe wait on customers with a friendly attitude and not argue about the fact that I must be drinking a different kind of club soda  Really  How about considering that perhaps the club soda you are pouring is tap water or at the very least admit that it's horribly flatStupid stuff to even give my time to really but unfortunately I have had enough of these experiences over the years and decided today was the last cocktail strawIt's a shitty bar that stinks with a lousy and entitled wait staff none of whom really know how to make a decent drink and if they do know they don't want you to knowI vowed tonight in the presences of my friends that I will never be going back here again  I don't care if we only have a moment to grab a bite and a drink  Sooo not worth the attitude and the funky smells that embed themselves in my clothing and hairOy vey I need to go take a bath right now.
Food took way too long.
I have eaten there in the past and has been a while  Food was very good when this restaurant first opened  Just went there 01/18/2014 I ordered the chicken dinner to go and it was the worst crap ever  First the cashier ran back and asked the cook if there was any chicken  I received 2 legs and  thighs which tasted and looked like it sat under a heat lamp for hours  For the price your paying u think it would be fresh  Quality has definitely went down  Will never again go to this culvers location again.
Food was a C- at best  Server never told us we would be paying $8 a bottle for water  No wonder the busboy kept filing up the glasses  Cesaer salad had no taste the fried chicken was dry and the macaroni and cheese was more like a soup   Oh by the way--the menu says whole chicken but you only get one drumstick and breastOverpriced wine list   Not a good experience  Finally the seats were uncomfortable.
I went back to Darque Tan yesterday to freeze my membership since I'm going to Europe for a few weeks  The gal behind the counter informed me that the last day to freeze an account is the 10th of every month even though the credit card on file is not charged until the 16th of every month  I told her I'd most likely cancel then and proceeded to tan  When I was finished I came back to the counter  She asked "So what did you decide"  I told her that I'd decided to cancel and she promptly printed out my cancellation form  It was dated 07/16/08  I asked her if my card would still be charged since the cancel date was the 16th instead of yesterday's date  She nodded and informed me ONLY THEN that the last day to cancel without a charge would have been the 10th  It would have been nice if she had told me that  So then I figured well shoot I am paying anyway maybe I should just keep the membership so I'll have a tan package when I get back  I asked her if it was too late to cancel  Her answer "Well sort of  It would be really hard and I'd have to call my manager to do it"  So I left and I don't think I'll ever walk through those doors again  What a shame  If that clerk wasn't too lazy to reverse the cancellation Darque Tan would still have a good paying customer.
When they first opened they had awesome prices on the meats now they are the same as anywhere else The fruit and veggies go bad in a day or less not a good thingNo reason to drive 8 miles out of my way when I can get the same if not better products closer to me.
OK We've been here before and the service was good the food was good but not the comfort food seafood that We have yet to find since Fosters closed it's doorsWe ate at Wildfish last night and what a nightmare No special occasion we are just dieting and go out once a week for a really good meal We were seated promptly as we had a reservation but I had to make an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived the place had a lot of empty space so I think we could have come soonerOur server was a nice guy he brought us our drinks and with his good description of the Lobster dish sold me on it After about 20 min wait he finally came back and took our order Both Entrees we wanted were out so we had do decide on something else OK it was late so I can understand thatHe notified us that there was only one serving of the Chilean Sea Bass So I asked for that He ran to the kitchen to reserve that then promptly came back for our order They serve it two ways Roasted with a lemon sauce and Hong Kong Soy Style I ordered it Roasted My wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp and we ordered a side of Asparagus After our Bisque about 30 min later out came the Sea Bass incorrectly prepared HK style and the stuffed shrimp I told the food runner that it was the wrong dish he said OK I'll fix that I asked how they can fix it if that was the last sea bass they hadThe Manager came out and apologized Apparently they had more "in the back" What does that really mean anyway It all comes from "the back" He was really a nice guy 5 min later the food came out and the bass was correct but my wife's entree was not really very hot They should have left it for her to start They also brought the wrong side ReallyDon't get me wrong the food was really good and I think the service snafu was just a comedy of errors the Manager came out again and comp'd a very large portion of our meal He really handled it as best he could but what prompted me to write this is that a very similar mixup happened at the table next to us They had the misfortune of having the most obnoxious loud talking server in the place They had to re-order stuff that they were out of Also he played off bringing out the wrong steak as a good thing ReallyBad service really kills an otherwise good restaurant we have seen some with good food but bad service close their doors (Metro Brasserie for instance) so I write this in hopes the wait staff of the world will pay attention and at least take this advice: WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN at the table and pay attention to detail.
This was not my first time at this restaurant but it was my last  The food did look appealing and the waiters were friendly but lost my appetite shortly after seeing a COCKROACH in the dessert section  After bringing it to the attention of workers who laughed during and after disposing of it I did pay the check in full and left  No apologies or excuses were made which left me to believe this was not the first incident like this.
Good food worst service on earth   Staff has no idea what is in their food   Manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors   Too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good  Walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is.
Decided to check the place out last night as it's in my neighborhood To say the service was poor would be admitting there was service Walked in was told there was a show and to choose either a place at the bar or the tables at the end or on the patio choose the inside Sat down 10 minutes later waitress hands me a menu 20 minutes later I walk out with out anyone asking me for a drink or what I wanted to eat Had heard good things about the place In my opinion avoid like the plague.
I know this review won't stop people from going here just want management know things need to change The food and beer are pretty decent Came a few weeks ago for dinner on a particularly cold night We were seated at the only open table Near the doorway to outside This doorway was open and it was FREEZING We were told we could not move tables Nobody came to take an order which is funny because we were near the server station to run bills There were 5-6 serves standing there ignoring us After 20-25 mins we got up and left I told the hostesses on our way out Also they didn't do anything Very disappointing.
I ordered take out for twoduring breakfast (steak and eggs with gritts biscuitsand gravy) I placed my biscuits on top off my gritts put my eggs on top of my biscuits and poored my gravy over all of it As I dove into my ' heart attack waiting to happen' I dicovered a very thick black hair aproximatley 3 inches in length Needless to say  I didnt finish my meal.
I must preface this by admitting that I haven't stayed in a Motel 6 in quite some time but I always remembered them as being just OK- small a little dingy probably noisy but a cheap place to get some rest  My recent experience here was quite different  Firstly despite reserving a "non-smoking" room I arrived in the evening to find that none existed  My room smelled like a freshly used ashtray and my throat started getting scratchy right away  I went out for dinner and a cocktail and returned to find a security guard wanting to walk me to my room  Instead however of "have a good night" or something similar he told me that I had better not make any noise or I'd be kicked out  OK  I went quietly inside and started looking for the remote control for the TV  None  Pay extra for wi-fi  I was considering it but what is that new choking smell  SMOKE  Something is on fire  I opened the door to find smoke pouring out of the neighboring room  With a toddler staring out from behind him my neighbor tried to assure me that the smoke was just his bandanna that had accidentally caught fire and everything was under control  Pay no attention to this crack pipe or the acrid smoke that I'm exhaling nowNow my throat is really getting sore  It's 3 am and I'm scared that if I fall asleep the place could burn down  Where's that security guy now Feeling really dirty I looked at the bathtub and shower  Burn marks all over it  Burn holes in the bedding too nicesmall bar of soap but no shampoo  1 extremely threadbare tiny towel  Not inviting whatsoeverI had a reservation for a second night but instead slept for an hour or so in my truck in the parking lot and then found a different place to stay/bathe  Cursing the guy who recommended this placeI'm hoping the smell comes out of my clothes now.
Been here a few times and not by choice either Food is not good Limited options for kids as well  The service is slow and overall not worth it.
Can't believe this place is still in business  We went to the Harkin's Theater for an evening movie and decided to have a later evening dinner after reverse of our norm   Upon leaving the theater we quickly realized that we would have to walk somewhere to eat dinner since the roads in the vicinity were in gridlock the Peoria Stadium had just finished up their 4th of July festivities  We were quite happy to see Johnny Fox's Public House on the end of the parking lot  The outside of the building looked inviting so we decided to try it  We were greeted by a very nice blonde hostess who quickly brought us to a cozy booth in the bar area  As she sat us she handed us 3 regular menus and 3 "late night" menus (it was 10:05pm)  I excused myself and went to the restroom (which was far from clean)  On the back of the stall door and by the sinks I noticed posted signs that discussed their happy hour and times 10pm being "Reverse HH"  Right after I sat back down at the table the hostess began picking presentation signs up off of all the table  I noticed it was the HH signs  Hmmm  About that time the server came back to our table and said "Sorry the kitchen has taken down their line for the regular menu we only have the late night menu" and he removed the menus from our table  I then asked about the HH  He said that they didn't do HH on holidays (not stated on the flyers table menu or even their website that I looked at later)  Since we needed time to look at the alternate menu we asked for a few minutes to decide  I looked around and other tables that were just being sat were still being given the standard menu even though by this time it was well after 10  We asked to speak to the manager  A dark haired man in a cheesy royal blue jacket came to our table side  When I told him our concerns and said we would not be ordering anything else and would like to pay our check (my husband had ordered a drink) he just said "I'm sorry you feel that way  would you like me to take care of that for you" (meaning our bill)  I figured he would at least give us HH price on the 1 beer but no instead he ran our credit card for the full amount and brought it back I have to say we go out to eat about 3-4 times a week and with all of the wonderful restaurants to choose from in the Phoenix are we will not make the mistake of going to Johnny Fox's Public House ever again.

unbelievable thats what i have to say about scottsdale lanes this saturday morning arrived at 11:15 am to bowl on the special for 2 hours for $1300  was given a lane by a very unprofessional person at the counter (customer service is not there specialty) went to lane 21 and started bowling bowled a few games with my new ball then whamo the ball doesn't come back on lane 22 was another person bowling and whamo their ball doesn't come back both balls are stuck in the pit and not returning to the rack on the lane i went up to the counter and told them that both balls have not returned and the person at the counter said" i'll tell the manager waited l0 minutes nothing happened finally the manager(a large woman) goes back to retreive the balls waited 10 more minutes and she finally comes back and states "sorry i can't get the balls out of the pit i tell her to get the mechanic to get them and she says "i don't have a mechanic today to do that" unbelievable what kind of bowling lanes don't have a mechanic on duty on a saturday she tells me to throw another ball down the lane and all the balls will return to the rack so i throw a ball down the lane  the woman on lane 22 also throws a ball down the lane  now there are 4 balls stuck in the pit on lanes 21&22 again i tell her 4 balls are now stuck she gets upset and calls the mechanic on her cellphone  she goes back to retrieve the balls and finally after 37 minutes of waiting the balls finally return to the rack  she comes back to my lane and says she is sorry about the delay nothing more nothing less  i tell her i'm not happy about the delay and she again states she is sorry but is not willing to do anything else to please me or the person on lane 22 i tell her i'm done bowling and i want my money back she walks away and tells me again that she is sorry and i'm not getting my money back talk about lousy customer service the people that work here don't know what the word ''customer service'' means what a terrible place to go bowling this place has terrible customer service and lousy employees that work there never again will i ever bowl there again but i'm telling everyone i know about my experience.
I hope I was just there on an off day Probably the worst italian food I've ever had at a restaurant The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired as well - it kinda feels like the dining room of the rest home my grandfather lived in.
The waiter was fast and attentive  However the food was disgusting  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich  It was bone dry and cooked to the point if being like leather  I ate mid afternoon  I suspect the meat was under a warming lamp for some hours.
I can't stand how this Walmart never has enough registers open and the employees all look at you like you are some major inconvenience to them The site-to-store: nightmare One register you have to call for help- they disappear to the back for no less than 10 mins- and one two occasions I've picked up my items and they were damaged Walmart is horrible After my experiences this Christmas season Never again I'm done Buy local and boycott Walmart.
Don't let the fancy façade fool you: This is the saddest dingiest most disappointing Goodwill I have ever visitedEver spot a cute guy or girl from across the room then you get up close and they've got a unibrow halitosis and aren't actually wearing pants This is that Goodwill.
Words cannot even express how much I hate this place It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here I've been here four times FOUR CHANCES and they blew every single oneVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends Order a margarita Worst margarita of my life hands down My friend also ordered one and hated it We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back It was that bad) We told our server that we'd like something different but we needed a moment to decide She rolled her eyes took them away and we didn't see her until much later when she delivered our bill I had no drinks that nightVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch Ordered the crab sandwich I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it it was so disgusting Now I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par Getting meals you don't like is a part of life This however was inedible For the second time ever (I never send food back I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad) I had to send it back and ask for something different Our server seemed really perturbed but did bring me the meal I ordered instead It was mediocre at best but I ate it without any complaint I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal even though I didn't in hopes of her mood improving It didn'tVisit #3: Don't even ask me why but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time though) but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way Dirty looks only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there didn't say hello or smile once We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case To be clear we did not complain about anything at any time We were kind polite and didn't keep her from other tables What the hellVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors First off we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree) Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again outside of the place by the sidewalk) A man promptly and rudely said "I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there" Okay So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him When we got back and found a seat I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us Upon asking us what we wanted to drink I said "There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar" "We don't" He said and just looked at us That's it I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer) "No I told you we don't" Finally after awkwardly floundering about my friend and I settled on another drink We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball) But seriously dealing with TWO rude men tonight plus the history I've had there makes me realize I really will never go back ever And I mean it this timeI mean truly I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me I smile big say hello don't take too much of their time don't whine or complain etc But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way.
Very unhappy with the experience of having to stand outside forever and then inside The people inside suck ass as well very rude inconsiderate and not helpful at all If you don't like your job find a new one Seriously.
My husband had the steak sandwich and said it was good  I tasted his garlic fries and they didt have much flavorbut most of all were not real hot and not crispyJust a kind of hardness  Nothing to look at or tempt me to eat moreI had the Kobe burger and will never have another It looked hard and dark and was not juicy at all  Maybe a burger  really should have some fat or they don't know what they aredoing   I never use ketchup but had to drown this burger in it for some flavor  YukI so wish I would have sent it back but our server was so nice  This place is over priced and could take a lesson from Cheesecake Factory where everything is consistently GOOD     Thank God we had a birthday coupon and got a break on the bill  Free chocolate cake that was not moist except for the frosting  Will never go back    We don't care about the beer.
Bad service 3 times gets you yelped Strike 3 - Recently we changed our address and they are holding a pile of mail  Since we are out of state now my tenant goes over there to retrieve the mail they are holding (3 weeks now) and they replied "I'm not going in there now to sort through it it will be mailed to them next week" - OH I see it takes a month for you to do it Should have taken 5 daysStrike 2 - They changed our mailbox key and gave us the wrong key  Nobody would help us until my husband had to pull the attitude card JeeshStrike 1 - I received a gift in the mail box was too big for the mailbox so they kept it at the post office no note no drop off nuthin'  I had to go track it down there it was sitting there waiting for someone to deliver it  A week they had it.
******************* OUT OF BUSINESS ******************* We wanted to go recently and it was totally gone.
Purchased a groupon for Urbano and excited to try a Latin fusion restaurant in old town Scottsdale Although the server was extremely kind and attentive we were sadly let down by the food It started out well with the ambiance and look-shabby chic We had the complementary fried plantains with spicy pico de gallo and chipotle mayo which was very good We then had the beef and potato empanadas-they were light and crispy but beef & potatoes were kind of bland They were good when enhanced with the pico & mayo We also ordered the green chili burger which sounded very promising but was more like a picnic burger w/ a store bought sesame seed bun and flavorless meat It came with fries that had crushed pepper parsley cotija cheese and were completely boring in taste The spices didn't compliment the already dull fries We also had the fish tacos that sounded divine but were fishy (tilapia) and fell flat All these dishes had going for them was the spicy pico de gallo Needless to say we will not be back and would not recommend this place.
Cultureless chain restaurant with bland food Employees are more interested in flirting with each other at the host stand than to acknowledge you when you walk in or walk out.
place is nice staff is stuck up and rude i really like this place its very upscale i don't know the person who did my nails cause she didn't tell me she forgot what services i wanted "but theres a bar tab' doesn't make any sense i was supposed to get a hot stone massage and a sugar scrub but i guess she really didn't care on what i wanted this has to be the worst nail salon i been to ever  i mean paying "50" just for regular services i added two luxury services but oh well she where's glasses middle age woman i think it was very unprofessional e  and i will defiantly not go back.
Ugh We absolutely hated our experience here When we first arrived the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us "sir" and "madam" which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying Little did I know that ~32 minutes later we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly The service was totally unimpressive especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol but what really turned us off was the overly sweet sugary and poorly-thought-out food We started with the "Mill Avenue" appetizer sampler The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically the least authentic item) - the other items including the sauce were just off The spare ribs were dry the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made) and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu and there it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce Here it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated "sauteed" veggies My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder When the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates he asked if everything was ok Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (eg a meat can be redone to be less well-done) In this case the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning With so much wrong a complete overhaul would be necessary And sowe said "We're just full Thanks" and got the hell out of there.
This place is death on a plate The buffet served like warm food The hibachi raw meats were warm and slimy The manager just shrugged his shoulders and said ah well I then puked in the parking lot NASTIEST PLACE EVER.
With 4 stars on yep I was hoping for a tasty breakfast but after a long wait I got a plate of overcooked eggs weird tasting greasy bacon completely undercooked potatoes (how hard is it to cook taters until they are brown) and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill terrible It was all really inedible as was the Menudo that my girlfriend ordered Disgusting Also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers very weird place Is it a restaurant store bar Not sure I am sure it sucks though and I will never go back.
Okay so at one point in time I would have been happy to say Garcia's was a good place to eat Not anymore It is probably the worst place ever Let me tell you of my experience and their horrible service at this placeWe were at Arizona Mills and were starving  We passed up Rainforest Café as the wait was long and Garcia's was no waiting  Now I know whyWe were seated almost immediately Now keep in mind I have eaten at Garcia's in the past (years ago) and was pleased  The first thing I notice is our waiter looks like a McDonalds reject- his grammar is horrid and he mumbles almost constantly  There is nothing pleasant about this guy I order a beer and fish tacos  After over 20 minutes my beer shows up and is sloshed all over the table  Okay- no big deal I wait and wait and wait Finally my fish tacos show up- or wait- what is this He gives me the plate of food and leaves  I sit staring in amazement wondering why my fish tacos look so funny I look at my plate wave to get his attention and when he finally has time for me he comes over  I tell him "Hey I don't know what this is but I ordered fish tacos" His reply Get ready- I've never ever in my life heard this one My waiter the guy who is supposed to make my eating experience here WONDERFUL says "The guy who got your tacos isn't complaining" of course I chuckle thinking he is joking when indeed I realize he is NOT  He points across the room to the guy who received my tacos and seemed to have no issue with it I tell him I do not want the mess in front of me but the fish tacos I am surprised he didn't go get the half eaten ones from the other guyI get my fish tacos they were disgusting Poor quality poor taste poor everything  I get the ticket to see not only was I charged for the Steak and enchilada sauce (or whatever it was) but for the TWO plates of fish tacos WOW All I got from this restaurant was a very bitter taste in my mouth.
The customer service at this pharmacy has really gone downhill The girls working the counter are uncaring and even rude  They don't deliver on the promise of free home delivery to clients I had to pay 8$ for a home delivery of a medication they failed to give me Don't take the fake smiles too seriously.
This is a cry for help I feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible From the start there were issues We waited at the front to be seated for several minutes while there were only a couple tables filled I think there were only 2 servers working which was clearly understaffed but also seemed like its probably normal The food was bad As in my chile relleno tasted ROTTEN It was filled with some gross greasy cheese mess and had doubly greasy batter that it was fried in I honestly wouldn't have fed this to a pigI probably have more to say but I feel that any more effort is unnecessary and would be a lost cause.
COLD IMPERSONAL AND INDECENT- do not go to Simonmed Imaging Deer Valley (located off 27th Ave in Phoenix) if you expect to be treated like a person I came to Simonmed for an ultrasound   The ultrasound tech barely said a word to me- however she did say that the doctor would come into the room to speak with me after the ultrasound  Instead the doctor looked at my images through email and instant messaged the tech to tell me to come back in 6 months The doctor did not have the decency to come in and speak with me  I will NEVER go back to this place.
I use to love Barrio Café but I got tired of their prices going up and the food quality and service going down so I stopped going there I decided to give Barrio Queen a try tonight - BIG MISTAKE  After being seated and waiting over 15 minutes I finally had to flag the hostess down to say that no one had stopped by to take our order  Waiter came over and said he was story that no one had told him people were seated in his area  I didn't really understand that has there were only 4 other couples in the entire restaurant eating and it wasn't like he couldn't see for himself that someone was waiting He recommended a cheese fondue for an appetizer - cheese was ok but it came with a laughable amount of chip - 6 chips on the plate to be shared Then another long wait and more waiting ---- then the food arrived  Was just ok - nothing really exciting  Most of the tacos I tried had no flavor Half way into the meal I flagged down the waiter to ask for someone to refill our water glasses  He said he'd be right back and then he just disappeared for about 15 minutes  Then when he walked by again I reminded him that we wanted a refill on water - again he said he'd bring the water  So another 10-15 minutes went by and he never with the water or a check  I finally got tired of waiting and went to the front of the restaurant to ask someone to find the waiter so that I could get the bill  Never did he apologize for the extremely poor service I paid the bill and left and will NEVER return  As I was leaving I overheard a couple in front of me discussing also what poor service they received.
DO NOT GO HERE  Even if you've suddenly developed airport standards you can do better Walk down toward gate C17 you'll find three better places right away The service here is slow the margaritas are ALL mix and the food is bland and a complete waste of your money  According to a couple other yelpers the food here has been compared to "fast food" I--a complete stranger whom you should trust because I'm taking the time out if my life to tell you a stranger this info--am telling you it is much worse than fast food I've experienced much more pleasure from fast food It has flavor and doesn't cost what you make per hour This place was better a couple years ago Perhaps they have new management Who cares Take your biz on down the line.
I have been going here for years LOVE the food Problem on our order made this week (delivery pizza & wings) our entire family AND extended family got food poisoning (there is no way it was a bug only people affected were those who ate chicken wings).
I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day  My car was in desperate need of a bath and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale  Because I did not want to continue to drive in shame I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on itWhen the soapy cycle of the wash began I noticed something flying above my car  To my surprise I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash "arm"  To their credit the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forthback and forth  I think one of them smiled at me (A side notewhere there are birds ready to poop they will find me somehow  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens)I am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash  So I sit and wait  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car  Of course within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car  To make things even more enjoyable the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood  After all who wants wet pigeon poop on their carMoral of the story peepsif you want pigeon poop and a car wash this is THE place to be  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back  However I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.
Here is what I can legally say:My brand new truck went in with flawless factory chrome wheels  My brand new truck came out with a chunk taken out of the factory chrome wheelsAlso they didn't dry the thing - I had the attendant come back twice to dry it but gave up with water spots on my carThe manager Andy will most likely raise his voice to you and deny responsibility for the damage you receive if he treats you the way he treated meI have been going to this car wash for years and it has usually been nearly flawless  Now the one time something bad happens for me there they stand behind their "flawless reputation" and in the words of their manager Andy they are perfect and all the others who have said they damaged their vehicles are wrong StrangeI am waiting for the general managers response.
That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for I actually use to really like this place Great happy hour Good flavors on the wings I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be Like tonight for example I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew Well no I got a full order When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings she offered to get me a box I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not despite my eager suggestion Needless to say the evening continued I eat one wing literally one A cockroach walks onto the bar It was small and may have been a beetle but still ew  There goes my appetite  Words of advice  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's wear protection Serves with mediocre at best The gals working there are 12 so I don't expect much I suppose However  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like) I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings Not good Just decent I think the beer helps Long story short If you have a party and want cheap cheapness well then you've found omg an other cockroach just walked up on the bar Are you absolutely kidding me Im seriously about to freak out and walk out I don't care if I haven't paid This is embarrassing DO NOT  EAT HERE.
Not impressed at all Rice is under cooked crab puffs were inconsistent either huge and super cheesy or a tiny folded crisp Shrimp tasted weird The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched Delivery speed was mediocre Don't think I'll order from here again unless I'm desperate.
One of the worst hotels I stayed in anywhere  During my spring training visit earlier this year almost every day I had trouble with the door key cards  Very poor decor also.
Went on a Friday during happy hourtacos were supposed to be half pricethey weren't and they weren't any good eitherNo booze here  and it didn't feel like any air conditioning Blech try Los Dos Molinos for real Mexican food.
One star Have my id and they denied me for nor reason other than I have basketballl shorts on I'm in town for a freaking BCS Bowling Game are you kidding me What a bunch of idiots.
Very bland food an incompetent waiter and dirty dishes and flatware  The draft beer was totally flat Pretty awful.
So I'm catching up on all my reviews an sorry to say this place being right across the street from me I probably won't go out of my way to go again The food is decent but the service is horrible more than one occasion myself and my party were ignored and I mean for almost an hour one time At one point I finally got up went to the bar and order than was looked at like what the hell are you doing up here go sit back down I almost threw a fit until my friend told me let it go Another occasion we sat at our table for over 30 mins and not one person came by yet servers kept passing us every 5 mins finally had to ask for a Manager but never showed than a server came along and finally took our Order I really hope they get/got  new management and let go most of the staff and get new blood who knows what they are doing.
Very disappointedI had my usual Dirty martini but a friend wanted just a soda since she was drivingDo you know what they charged$400  For a soda  And it was in the smallest glass  Come onWith DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in  $400 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case  ($350) I am not cheap by any stretch but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda  Don't go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink deal.
Was very excited to try this place  On a girl's weekend with 6 friends and needed some yummy breakfast food  Got seated immediatley at about 9 on a Saturday morning  Ambiance is cute menu looked great  I have a gluten allergy and was hopeful they would be accomodating seeing as they are a young new place  Not so much  I ordered an eggs benedict dish with veggies on it  I ased for it to be on corn tortillas after our server told me they had no gluten free bread options  I also said no hollandaise sauce on it and the egg cooked well  After MUCH waiting and much speculation that our server did not even actually work for the restaurant because she never brought our drinks and we would see her disappear for long periods behind some door we get our food and mine is literally on one corn tortilla that has been torn in half  It is also covered in sauce  So I say I need to send it back and have it remade with no sauce  She asks "do you want the sauce on the side" I say "no no sauce at all I have an allergy"  So about 10 minutes later once my friends are just about finished I get a plate with the sauce on the sidereally  I go to take a bite and the eggs are barely cooked (thanks for dipping them in warm water before serving them to me)  I now have egg yolk all over the parts that I can eat but now won't because I just don't go there  By now the rest of our table is done and I say take it back take it off the bill  She spends 10 more minutes running around the place with my plate assumingly looking for a manager who never did come apologize because I can only guess they were busy apologizing to other people  It's a cute idea but VERY poorly executed and with a management staff who is very full of themselves and doesn't seem to care about the customer  I say try a different place.
Are you kidding me  I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews It is fast food BBQ If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here Do not go here if you want real BBQ This place sucks.
I'm pregnant and craving Mexican  I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try  Being on a budget I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $199 for more  Also only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $225 each)  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off especially here in the desert  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with "mole" sauce  It was absolutely disgusting  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce  Decent but not worth $1049 they charged for simple enchiladas  The chips were nothing to write home about honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing  The salsa (a trio of regular green and hot) was bland and tasteless albeit spicy (which didn't help my sudden need to suck down the limited drink I had ordered)  I am reliving the food even now as it gave me horrible heartburn and left me feeling extremely nauseas  I will never be going back ever again.
Seriously I like my Thai food a lot and this place was pretty much a joke We decided to get a few appetizers and split an entree for lunch The place was empty for the exception of two dirty fish tanksThe Thai rolls were overcooked and greasy served with a side of some ketchup/duck sauce mixture that was more ketchup than anything They were placed nicely on some shredded lettuce that they probably got from the dollar store next doorNext was the vegetable tempura again over cooked over breaded and served on a bed of lettuce with that same ketchup sauce AwesomeThe next delightful failure was the tempura tofu that was supposed to come with peanut sauce but consistency remained as it was served over cooked on a bed of lettuce with that damn ketchup sauce We did remind our server about the peanut sauce and she did rectify the situation The peanut sauce was also watery and extremely lameWe shared the yellow curry with tofu The best part about this dish is that it DID NOT come atop the lettuce with a side of ketchup sauceThe rice was a bit sticky the curry sauce was missing something I'm not quite sure what but it was missing something The veggies were soft and over done two of the four pieces of potato were undercooked I guess I should look at that as a bonusThe server was fine a little quiet but no problems with the service She was just doing her job With our "coupon" the total bill still seemed a bit high not to mention the fact that they tax the predetermined tip with everything elseStay far away.
I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review because the service and quality of food annoyed me so much that I didn't even want to wait until I got home I understand that it's a weekend and busy but after waiting for ice and iced tea to be filled/brewed given an attitude by a server when I asked a question and waited 30 minutes for my to-go sandwich I think their "it's busy" excuse is void Here is my experience with the restaurant inside the QC Olive Mill:There are signs on the wall stating that orders are made fresh and take time so I didn't want to be pushy about my sandwich But when I noticed about 5 other people pick up their order who had ordered after me I decided to finally ask Oh don't worry it had only been sitting on the line for the last 20 minutes because they "lost the ticket" Hello didn't you see a customer standing there patiently waiting and looking slightly confused Did you think to ask if the sandwich was hers From someone who worked in the restaurant industry lack of a sense of urgency is unacceptable When I finally got my order all they gave me was a "sorry" and a $1000 sandwich that resembled the size of a hockey puck All in all I'm mad I made the drive out here and should have just stopped at the Firehouse Subs I passed on my way.
We used to come here a lot but then not long ago had a very poor experience  That coupled with their ever increasing already ridiculously high prices has made us not returnSo the last time we were there for 2 adults with beverages and tax it was around $30  Really   I can go to a much nicer place get just as full and have decent table service for less  The salad is ok though the selection in good  The soups are average and the bread is mediocre at bestSo on the night in question my wife and 2 kids and me went for dinner which came to $48  A short while after I started eating I began to not feel well  NOT (let me be clear) in any way related to the food but because of other issues  I was not able to eat and had eaten less than half of the salad on my plate  I asked a server if I could take the rest with me as I was not feeling well  She said she didn't know and walked away  A moment later a new person came to the tabel who I assumed was a manager though she did not introduce herself  She told me that I could not take my food home with me unless I paid for a "to-go" meal  I got a bit annoyed and told her that was not acceptable  She disappeared and a few minutes later the store manager came out  He explained that I would be charged a separate to-go charge if I took my food with me which was about the same price as the meal  I told him that I had already paid for this particular food I didn't want anything else and only wantedto take what was on my plate and have it later  He again stated that it was store policy to charge me a to go charge  I said "so what you're telling me is that it is ok for you to take the plate and dump it in the trash but I can't take MY food that I have alreay PAID FOR home and eat it later"  What BS is this I was a bit upset and we ended up leaving without my uneaten salad  What really was the final straw was the manager saying "Thank you come again" when I was leaving in a very snotty toneI filed a complaint with corporate which remains ignored  I will instead go to Souper Salad across the street and have better food and service and my wife and I can eat for $15 for both of us.
so I tell my girl pick a place to eat and I will take you there after work so tells me she picked Joes Farm Grill  I am thinking fresh veggies and great food as we pull up I see people outside eating and burgers and fries mehas we get inline I see chicken burgers ribshoney say it isn't so wtf I want food baby foodShe orders salmon with salad I order chicken tenders and onion rings with a vanilla bean shake We find a picnic table to sit at in the dark and I go get the food My rings are cold I eat my chicken  She eats the salmon and her salad We drink the shakeNow I am no kill joy but I PAID $3000 FOR CHICKEN TENDERS AND SALMON JOE WHAT THE HECKI wont do that again trust meTHIRTY BUCKS I should have paid half that  Say it ain't so Joe.
These guys are as uncooperative and inconvienent as you can get If you rent with a debit card they will hassle you to no end Two utility bills proving you are at said address and bank statement of proof of connection to debit card Thats a lot of personal information they dont need and unethical employees could swipe this information easily The women there are just idiots and have no friendliness or able to accomodate anything DONT EVER GO HERE The car selection is bad too.
When you want to spend $499 on a Lunch Buffet All-You-Can-Eat Pizza Salad Breadsticks and Dessert | Served Mon-Fri 11am to 2pm I guess this is the deal for you.
I once loved to shop here but not any more rude and dirty stores.
My lady friend got really annoyed the other day at Paradise Bakery and was almost in tears over the stress endured trying to order a simple lettuce and tomato salad and some blue cheese dressing on top She got something completely different and an ass chewingShe explained perfectly what she wanted while being prodded down the chute by a young manager and a couple of fellas on the line that had not yet mastered the English language After a completely unnecessary lecture by this manager fella who seemed annoyed that anyone would dare ask a question to slow down the ringing of the almighty cash register they completely disregarded her request and gave her a bowl of miscellaneous pasture weeds and a sweet balsamic dressing  She was frazzled and pissed when we sat down but not one to complain I witnessed the entire thing and they could have easily given her a bowl of romaine some tomato and blue cheese dressingThis having been my first time I'd been in a Paradise Cafe for lunch the entire experience seemed a little awkward I had to look around to find any type of menu and all I saw was sandwiches  After I ordered I saw the salad menu but it was too dam late I was already down the end of the line where they clip your ear and brand your backside with a sandwich built their way with no choice of bread cheese or even the cookieWildflower seems to cater much better to the soup salad and sandwich consumer than Paradise Cafe I like it when a restaurant has well thought out menus and they don't treat you like cattle.
This place manages to have worse customer service than both the MVD and Walmart which is pretty impressiveThe lack of customer service coupled with world class apathy- makes me cringe My experience has truly astonishing and I look forward to finding a different provider ASAPLong story short I need routine respiratory supplies and they are supposed to be mailed on a quarterly basis For some reason in June I didn't get my supplies but being super busy and working 60-80 hours a week I didn't have time to call them Flash forward to Sept (give or take) and I called asking where my items were I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn't the one being used for mailing No problem things happen- they said they would fix it and send over what I neededFast forward to October and I still don't have the stuff I continue to make do with my old stuff and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what's up The person there was nice and said that she didn't know why I didn't get my order it was never shipped- but she would send it out I never got that shipment either but with the busy holidays I didn't get a chance to call until Nov/Dec I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time I never received anything until the end of Dec when I got the three months supply that is for Jan-March I have no idea what happened from June-Dec but eight months passed without supplies and all the while my insurance company was being billed and they paid for supplies I never receivedI called today and spoke with a nice RT who put me on hold and a new person whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me It's worth noting that I am very laid back and I don't get upset or yell or any other douchey behavior I can't help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations but that's not me so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies that were still missing since June This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem I reminded her that I had called several times since June and was still waiting The woman told me that "normal people" call sooner and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it to call and advise them that I never got the package I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things when  they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies Perhaps I should employ a psychic I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive and she essentially said that they don't know I didn't receive them So now I am a liar too which is nice  All in all I don't think you should have to micro-manage a company who is supposed to have their act together Mistakes will happen and that's ok but when a mistake does happen don't treat your customers like shit and tell them that they are doing it all wrong The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment I am told that it must have been stolen I told her that since I hadn't received my supplies in 8 months a more likely scenario is that they never sent it but she said that it had been sent So miraculously all my Amazoncom packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood but a small light box from them was stolen Uhh ok- that makes senseTo recap it's forgivable to mess up shipping something but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly and to bill for items that were never shipped or received I highly recommend you go elsewhere save yourself headaches time and energy.
Totally excited to try this place out my grandparents my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food It wasn't too busy just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out Unlike other Korean restaurants their lunch special selection is very limited Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda) or special C Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken As we were looking at the "lunch special" board the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom "are you Chinese" Even though she is my mum looked at me all puzzled as in "what does that mean" The lady proceeded by pointing at the "seafood pancake" section on the menu and saying "I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said or else So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($699) a bulgogi ($699) and a beef yakisoba ($719) The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini "kimchi" buffet bar with trays of marinated tofu potato bean sprout kimchi broccoli and some other vegetables It also has this delicious house special hot sauce By the time we finished a dish of kimchi the food came so it didn't take long The spicy chicken came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper) was tender with rice underneath it The chicken was definitely marinated well however the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat what a bad way to end it The bulgogi also came in a bowl with rice underneath The beef was definitely not marinated fully The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless The biggest disappointment food-wise was the beef yakisoba The noodles occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box were sweet Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice topped with 3 pieces I kid you not THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized super-dry meat In the end we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well teenage boys tend to eat everything) While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless) I went to ask for a plastic cover This is the best part: the same lady stared at me pointed at the salad bar and said "you can't take that home" I thought there was a miscommunication so I asked again for a lid for the noodles Again she pointed at the salad bar and said "you are not allowed to take the kimchi home" Wow seriously Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out "Look I just want to take my noodles home ok" She hesitantly gave me a lid"Hey hey you we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'" only if I said that to her faceOh and when we got home my brother aka our food dumpster took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again  Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang Chodang is WAYYY BETTER hands down.
Very poor customer service Refuses to see patients during normal business hours Has a VERY high turnover rate  Three different chiropractors have come and went at this location during the past 6 months So there is no consistency with treatment New receptionist every few months Tries to sucker you into a huge treatment plan that will cost a couple thousand dollars Not worry they offer financing (sarcastic tone) This is a sham chiropractic business that is more concerned about getting your money than actually treating your ailment Will never go back Find a real chiropractor that isn't money hungry.
This place charges a cover charge We should be paid to come in there It's in a horrible place in town drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous The inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2 You can't pay me to come back there I wish I had known how horrible this place was before I got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money.
First I will say that I have been a regular patron of this hotel in the past For my most recent experience I was treated with extreme disrespect and disregard despite the fact I have chosen this hotel in the past It was a Saturday night and my girlfriend and I had returned from a night out on Mill Ave Things turned intimate on the bed but noise levels were well within reason We inadvertently left the curtains open on a second floor room facing the courtyard We finished our activities and got up to get dressed and saw a security guard running across the courtyard screaming at the top of her lungs to close the curtains Surprised and embarrassed we immediately closed the curtains and sunk into bed to go to sleep The security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up As we were tired and not dressed and now that the curtains have been fully closed we attempted to drift asleep This only lasted a short while until our door was pounded on by the police The property was asking us to leave For what We had to pay a taxi to take us to another hotel and pay for alternative accommodations At least this hotel was hospitable to us We kindly requested a refund from Mission Palms as we were not able to stay the whole night that we rightfully paid for It took three weeks for the management here to even respond and we were denied this request  Couples and anyone else who plans on doing what this hotel thinks of as "indiscriminate activities" in the supposed privacy of the room you pay for BEWARE Stay elsewhere.
Staff in this place are very RUDE and make you feel rushed The food is NOT that great and they give you waay to much food on your plate.
This Walmart has the worst customer service ever They never have enough lanes open and don't open additional lanes even though the lines go through the middle aisle of the store Horrible I will absolutely pay more and shop elsewhere.
I canceled my membership here because I felt uncomfortable every single time I came Who puts the ellipticals and treadmills in front of a bank of mirrors A pervy male that's who When I told them why I was canceling the tattooed meathead working the desk made me feel self-conscious and stupid Exactly how you want to feel when you're going to the gym right Then OF COURSE he didn't mention anything about a 30 day notice and they charged me for the next month anyway When I called he got really defensive and told me that it was on the paper I signed and told me that I needed to start reading things that I signed I told him that all he needed to do was TELL me about the policy and he hung up on me.
I made the mistake of trying to return a pair of gloves that ripped the first time I took them off  They were very rude almost angry that I didn't want to get another pairI won't go back.
I made an appointment for my daughter to see Dr Glick we were both very excited about the appointment especially since Dr Glick claimed to be a DO We thought he would take a more natural approach to my daughter's acne All he did was tell her she would most likely need acutane in the future (and we all know how safe that is) and tell her (without being asked his opinion on this matter) that her post acne hyperpigmentation would take years to heal What a terrible thing to tell a 14 year old girl just entering high school He had terrible bedside manner and his office manager is incredibly rude STAY AWAY.
We recently called from the office for delivery from Flaming Kabob and that was a flaming mistake  The pitas were pita-ful the 'fresh' juices a watery mess and the fries were actually melted into their plastic container  I have no experience of eating inside the restaurant and am unlikely to do so after this disaster.
My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to stop in for brunch At first glance this restaurant looked really dirty and cluttered A couple of tables were filled with diners but there were definitely tables available After a strange and awkward pause the hostess snapped "Do you have a reservation because these people just sat down and we won't be able to serve you for another 25 minutes" I have never been treated so rudely by a hostess before She essentially shooed us out of there it wasn't even a matter of being seated it was a matter of being served for another 25 minutes which is not a problem However after feeling so disrespected we quickly left and will definitely never EVER return.
Quite disappointed with my experience hereI was looking for a specific item (a black/grey cell phone case which they had on their website) for a birthday gift for my girlfriend and because I work near by to Scottsdale Fashion Square I figured I would check there to save on shipping/be more convenient for meThey did not have the item in the store but offered to order it for me and I was told that it would take "3-5 days" to arrive to the store (which is where I asked for it to be sent due to the location of where I work)  Now I assumed that the 3 to 5 days were business days but seeing as I was ordering it on Saturday the 14th and didn't need it until Saturday the 21st I figured that at the worst it would be there on the Friday which I explained all of this to the saleswoman before making the transactionAfter receiving no call by Friday afternoon I put in a call to the store to ask what the status was and the saleswoman told me that it was scheduled to arrive the following Wednesday (the 25th)  Shocked I explained the time frame that I was given when I ordered the case and the saleswoman stated that the time frame should have been 5-7 business days (which as it turns out the 25th would still be 8 business days after it was ordered)  The saleswoman also tried to explain away the delay by saying that it may have been due to the holiday to which I thought to myself "what holiday is in the middle of September" and the saleswoman quickly followed the holiday explanation up with "I mean its only a Jewish holiday but it may have caused a delay"  This definitely shocked me (only a Jewish holiday) but I proceeded to take the steps to see if my order could be taken care of in the time frame I was looking for  She looked at other stores in the Valley but it wasn't thereAfter hanging up with the sales woman I was looking at the receipt and noticed that the original saleswoman had ORDERED THE WRONG COLOR  Completely miffed at this point I called back to check if the color I had asked for originally was at any of the stores and again the answer was no and after discussing the incorrect order the saleswoman said that they could cancel the order and reorder in the correct color and have it one day shipped to the storeGiven the circumstance I understand that they did what they could but why wouldn't you have just one day shipped the original order That way when it was wrong I would have known in time to make other arrangements  Also the sales staff may want to work a little bit more on listening to what the customer is asking for/ordering and not saying insensitive things like "only a Jewish holiday" because it will certainly be a long time before I go to this location (if ever) again  Stick to online shopping or only buying what you can walk out of the store with when it comes to this store.
I wish there was an option for ZERO stars  I came here one late night after a night out in Tempe  We went to Corleone's for two reasons - 1 we were hungry and 2 we needed to use the restroom badly  As one of the few open places in the area it seemed like a good plan  However after ordering our mediocre sandwiches which we waited over 15 minutes for we were told the bathroom is closed at night even for the employeesWhat kind of establishment is allowed to be open serving food and does not even have a restroomI think they should be shutdown.
WowI can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets I am FAR from impressedHot giardenara Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude'sThis place is sub-par at best If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintockThis place doesn't live up to the hype  Don't waste your time People who love it must not be from Chicago.
I am a big fan of locally owned and operated family type places But this one is over rated over priced and the food leaves much to be desiredFrom the too busy to acknowledge you at the door to the self absorbed wait staff overall disappointingAnd to think I went twice in hopes it was just a bad dayNope Just a bad placeAlthough it looks like a usual for the hangover crowd.
The other day my boyfriend and I stopped in to get something quick to eat before we saw a movie He tells me what he wants to eat runs to the restroom while I wait in line to orderI get up to the counter to order and the cashier looked like she just crawled out of bed You could tell she didn't want to be there especially on a Sunday morning probably nursing a pretty gnarly hangover She looked tore up like something the cat dragged in But regardless I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt and asked her "Hello How are you today" She doesn't say anything except " What do you want" That immediately pissed me off but I was in a good mood so I decided to keep my mouth shut and order our food I order the french toast and she says we are all out of french toast I told her I would wait then because that's what my bf wanted and he was still in the bathroom So I wait about another three minutes and my bf comes out looking confused as to why I am still standing there I let him know they did not have what he wanted This time we order together and the cashier tells us that they are out of potatoes and we would not be able to substitute them for anything else I was so frustrated and pissed at the crappy service we decided to not eat there and walked out  How does a bakery/ breakfast place not have the key  items on the menu on a Sunday morning Not the mention the service from the cashier was horrid You will get better service at a frickn fast food place I don't recommend this place to anyone.
I ordered a cheese enchilada combo to-go It took about 25 minutes They were not particularly busy maybe 10-15% capacity Several people were seated and served while I waited No priority for to-go orders.
After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate here it goes We approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair When she jokingly said "no" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied "no" I guess this was her attempt at humor however after the first time it seemed to have lost something By the way she never really indicated that she was jokingSo $50 1 ceasar salad 1 spinach chicken whatever salad  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight Oh in between sitting down and paying the check the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold soggy burrito and rubberized tenders The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled While I understand we ate at an airport this is unacceptable Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here They'll be hearing from me soon.
Pubic hair in the bed poop on the wall in the bathroom smelt like a porta potty Other than that it was a grade A classy placeNOT Save yourself never go here.
Not impressed My first time there The service was very slow and it was was so frustrating as we had to ask for more chips and salsa and refills of our sodas The waitress NEVER came by out table to ask us if she can refill our soda or to offer more chips and salsa  The chips and salsa were great the food was good not great  Too bad the service was so horrible  I won't go back.
I have never in my life had such horrible customer service I ate here tonight with my husband and two kids When we got our order we noticed that we were missing a burrito My husband approached the counter and kindly mentioned to them what we were missing and the woman behind the counter Cynthia was totally rude and snapped at my husband and argued that she put it on our tray My husband explained that he did not see it and she rudely said that she would make us another one A few minutes later she storms to our table and slams down our tray with the missing burrito and points at another burrito on our tray and yells "See there it is right there" She then stormed off and glared at us and gave us a dirty look My husband and I were so upset we left without finishing our meal and went home and called the customer service number and left a message explaining what had happened I have never ever had to call a customer service number to complain Ever I will never go back to this location again and "Cynthia" needs a new job.
I probably shouldn't review PF Changs but feel it's my civic duty to warn anyone who still believes this is "Chinese" food it's fusion pretty Americanized and for whatever reason always gives me the runs ALWAYS It's probably me and you would think I have learned my lesson but I try every so often to see if my stomach can handle it and every time PF Chang's you bastard you beat me.
In town on vacation and wanted to get a pedicure with my husband We called 45 minutes in advance and although we made an appointment we were never really told that we could be seen right away When we got to our appointment on time  we asked again and we were told that they could get started right away They had us sit in a chair and ran water However no one started on us The women next to us didn't even have an appointment And when we asked them they said sorry others had an appointment When we explained so did wewe were asked to go to another salon Not we can fix itbut go elsewhere Funny no one inside looked like us so I dare not pull that card but I'll say our business was not welcomed So if you like bait and switch go here But there are tons of other options in Scottsdale No one deserves to be lied to.
Took my dog here It was the only place that doesn't require proof of shots Pretty decent for my poor side I can't cut my dogs nails cause they are black and I clip them too close and make him bleed every time I try They gave him back to me and all seemed okay Got him in the truck and he starts bleeding everywhere Really I could have done that myself and save the gas and the cost of it I won't be going back here They get 1 star just because you don't need proof of shots to bring your animal there.
I always give taco shops a fair shot But omgI think this place only stays in business because of surrounding bars I was completely sober and having a cravingate here for dinner one night (can't speak for breakfast time)  Everything is watered down From the chili sauces to the beans Taco shop looks like a cafeteriavery empty nothing on the walls The chicken was dark meat and mostly fat I will not eat here again Which is a shame because I live so close.
I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner however that did not happen First half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came then the wine a couple minutes after that Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks this did not happen Later we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti Chicken Cannelloni Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells) she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates "without meat" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it She responded that she would go check on that She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew that there was meat in the shells She offered no real apology to me did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.
It's McDonald's: How do you fuck up McDonald's  Easy--hire no one who speaks English consistently serve cold and stale french fries and generally let the store be filthy   I'm so glad I live in the quasi-ghetto.
Where to startmy bf and I went on Father's Day We were told up front things would be awhile but did they not get the memo they were working a busy Sunday holiday Unfortunately our waiter was embarrassingly terrible he was nice but he clearly did not care he was messing up our order and just about any table near us We were patient but he literally messed up everything from start to finish He forgot to give a soda to my bf didn't charge me for the coffee I did order (which fine w me) but the food took wayyy too long and they brought me the wrong thing They also forgot the one egg I ordered then when I asked they brought me too (again a mistake they made in my favorsweet) I ended up sending back the incorrect order and at that point I was so hungry and over the place I just asked for a muffin It was dry and disappointing The check took forever to get too Would not recommend and never going back Dottie's is a hot mess.
The worst customer service ever  I once bought an item tried to return it unused with a receipt  They said the item was discontinued and I could not return it  I found the exact same item on the shelf bought it up to customer service and they still refused to honor my receipt  I have no control over how their computer rings up my item but I was being penalized for it  She said I could return without using a receipt but then I wouldn't get my full price paid  There is always some type of issue with their customer service The restrooms are unclean and there is seldom anyone around to assist or check you out  Apparently no one works at customer service ever unless I go to ask for help.
I feel like by writing this review I should get my Yelp Elite status taken away I really do I felt bad about going I felt bad after it and I feel bad now For Christmas my husband and I were given gift cards to use at Applebee's We sort of looked at it like "WTF" but smiled and thanked his grandparents It's important to note that it was his family not mine because my family is far to awesome to commit such a travesty One Saturday we had no food in the house Seriously We had like some slimy lunch meat limoncello two stale hot dog buns and a 4 year old box of macadamia nuts we got on vacation while in Hawaii We were forced to go out Since we had to run some errands I suggested we take the damn gift cards and use them You can't fuck up a salad or a burger right So we get there at like 2 in the afternoon And the damn place has like 20 people waiting to be seated The servers are all milling around not doing anything tables aren't really cleared Finally someone comes up and starts seating people You know how the nightly news occasionally does hard hitting health/medical reports on the obesity epidemic in America Yeah bring a camera news crew and pan around for your stock footage Fred and Bessie have come home to graze I know that it's horrible of me to say that especially since I'm not thin by any means but dear god I was thin there And the whole place on top of it just has this air of death and desperation Apparently having a tool like Tyler Florence shill your food isn't attracting the foodie crowd The food was entirely meh Bland and tasteless but edible Just what I expected Portions were odd I had a roll up and onion rings Husband had steak fajitas We could have easily eaten just his fajitas but my roll up would have feed my dogs and left them begging for more I also have to wonder if when you work at Applebee's your soul dies Because I kid you not our waiter acted like that We needed more napkins we got two We needed a refill on drinks and he would disappear for like 15 minutes You say "Thank you" to him and he'd either grunt or say "no problem" If it's a problem for you to bring me some mother effing ketchup I am sorry for the inconvenience and suggest you try a job at Fridays Maybe some flair would help your spirits But then again I did this to myself I knew how horrible it would be and it was Am I overreacting being outrageous Probably One good thing came out over this lunch We figured Grandpa and Grandma had probably got these gift cards as previous gifts and were re-gifting them So our New Years Resolution: Give them gift cards to places we want to eat and await the re-gift.
Yelp rarely steers me wrong but this time it happened I ordered take-out and was so disappointed The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had weak and soggy with no crab The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil) The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump I'll stick to China Chili in the future.
I have been loyal AT&T customer for last 13 years and I have not been so unhappy with the service since an incident happened last month regarding my service  I am letting my sister use one of my phone lines She is just using my phone I am paying the bill and basically she has no authority to add/remove any features to any of my phones/ipad lines Her name does not appear in the bill I am the only account holder for all my phone/tablet services  But last month she decided to walked in to this store and asked if she can upgrade her line to an iPhone without my permission which she was able to do so and I don't know how she was able to do that The person that helped(name Brandon) according to the the Manager(John) verified her identify by checking her ID and compared to the name in the account (which does not match since we do not have the same first and last name) so obviously it was not verified The line she is using is not due for upgrade because I just added it a year ago so they decided to upgrade my iPad line which is not a phone and added different features even change the monthly charges ( I pay $25 per month for 2GB which this particular plan no longer exist) Also added two more features in her line which all of these they made I did not authorize since my sister is not the account supposedly not authorize to do anything with the account except use the phoneBottomline is these people that work here does not even protect the privacy of their customers How can an indviidual possibly say  they have verified her identity and matched it to the account If they did they should have not let her upgrade her line(first of all it is not ready for upgrade) and she is not authorize to user HER NAME DOES NOT APPEAR TO THE ACCOUNT AT ALL Therefore she cannot upgrade/change anything without my permissionI called AT&T and they cannot even help me because they said I have to call this place directly since it is a corporate store and need to speak to the Manager(John) And that whatever happened they are the one to fix it I did speak to the Manager and told me that he will fix it which up to now my account is still not fix My iPad line still showing a phone and new charges  I am paying a lot of money monthly for all the lines I have and this is the kind of service I get RIDICULOUSI do not recommend this store at ALL It is purely but do not provide quality service No customer service at all I have been calling for the last 15 days to get everything fix but so far not everything has been resolved.
Northlight their front counter employees and their office manager seem to be more interested in getting your money than they are in getting you better They are one of those companies who catch phrases are "You owe us $____" and "Our policy is _____" I was actually starting to establish a good rapport with the providers I was working with if they moved to a different company I would seek them out but never EVER again will I consider dealing with Northlight Counseling In fact Lindsey the office manager was always extremely combative and added to my depression and during our last interaction actually suggested that I "Find another company who's policies I approve of" In my opinion that's not very sensitive handling of a patient who is in need of help with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts I've been to numerous counseling places and have never been told to get lost before I will miss working with Dr Hicks he is a very good psych and I will miss working with Dr Davidson as well but when the office that is supposed to be helping you starts turning into the reason that you need to go there it's time to get out.
WTF.
While we've had numerous opportunities to try other Humble Pie locations we've always opted for something else There are much better pizzas in the valley (even on the west side) The pizza was cold and bland The service was lousy  We were incredibly disappointed and won't be going back.
what is this filth that i am eatinghad it delivered  but whoops  forgot the rice  how do you forget the riceanyhow the peanut sauce was deplorable  it was literally the consistency of water i could pour it down the drain - and didthe panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.
We went to CPK and it was terrible our server was in our face the whole time It was as if she was trying to rush us out and there was no wait for tables Then we had another server running the floor vacuum around our table and under our table hitting our feet I hate when restaurants allow this practice It is discussing and intrusive with little regard for your customers The food was cold and flavorless I will never return to this restaurant avoid it's a waste of your $$$.
You can not give zero stars on Yelp but Zero is the reality This is a review only for our student field trip booking experience Warning--- don't do it This had to be the worse experience of my 15 years of teaching in the classroom and booking field trips There was one issue after another ranging from no calls back to rude staff to hang ups to transfer after transfer to answering machine to dial tone  ARGHHH and frustration abound They now make all teachers wanting a Title One field trip to go to a worthless class No exceptions even by experienced educators  I mean really A class on how to learn how to go on a field trip "ReallyTIMES2" This is is a slap in the face for educators It would take too long to explain all the problems we had but rest assured it was the worse customer service in the world trying to book our field trip It took us three months to finally close the deal There is absolutely no excuse for this You would think in this economy they would be happy for our business One phone call had me hanging up on the woman because she was so horribly rude I will update the review after the trip which I sure hope goes better than the entire ugly experience of booking it We will never be going here again.
Awful experience when there was a problem with the pump after I swiped my credit card  I tried to use the pump but it was stuck or something and didn't work so I went inside and asked the clerk to cancel the transaction because I was going to try another pump  He said there was no transaction to cancel  I went to another pump and as I was pumping my gasoline another person pulled up and I could see that she was pumping on my credit card transaction so I went inside and the idiot clerk wouldn't do a thing about it after he told me there was nothing to cancel out  The woman who used my credit card refused to pay me for the gas she stole  Had to get their corporate office involved to get my refund  What a nightmare.
Q: How do they serve you a diameter-of-your-fist sized roll for $4A: Old fish.
Honestly I'm a bit surprised by the number of good reviews  My experience was far from positiveService was terrible  As the four of us in our party observed the waitress made a habit of bringing hot food out on a cart from the kitchen and rather than immediately serve it to the table she would stop by other tables on the way takes orders ask if they needed anything etc  This happened multiple times  Seems to me that should be the other way aroundI ordered the chicken fajitas  The rest of my party was served their food about 10 minutes before mine  That is also unacceptable  They felt bad about eating without me and I didn't want their food to get cold  The kitchen needs to learn how to time food so an entire table's order comes out at onceWe had to ask our waitress several times for napkins silverware and salsaAfter all of this the food was sub-par  My chicken lacked any resemblance of flavor  The rice and re-fried beans were fine except for the clearly over-cooked dried out edges of beans around the plate  The only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla  At least they can get cheese and tortillas to cook rightThey also charge $250 for a second helping of chips and salsa  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for more chips & salsaOverall being my first Mexican restaurant experience in Arizona I'm VERY disappointed(come on guys I can throw a rock to the border  I expected better)  I definitely won't be back.
Unfortunately I don't have a good thing to share regarding the practice of Sundin & Fish  As a new business owner with little to no tax knowledge I trusted the practice to guide me  Let's face it from the outside this firm is very regal and appears to be the end all be all for accounting firms  The first year the firm did our taxes it was easy and painless  The moment I started asking for help or asking questions I would receive that will cost you $120+ per hour we don't give info over the phone and I'd get referred to some website to search for an answer  After paying hundreds of dollars for completed returns an SCorp filing and a DBA filing and not knowing how to move forward I called  Once again I was told it was a fee to talk to them  The receptionist Jeanie along with both Fish brothers speak down to their customers-they have little to no respect and are completely unwilling to help-even after spending HUNDREDS of dollars for their services  It's as if they expect you to know how to do their job and get annoyed and frustrated when you don't know tax  I've NEVER received such horrific service from what appeared to be a reputable company  I'm at year end didn't pull a salary never was explained what needed to happen and I'm needing to have a salary shown NOW  Well isn't that greatthere goes my income for the rest of the year because the estimates they provided were far from accurate  I've sought out someone new for my taxes and have since learned that the little I was guided to do was very shady and unethical.
THEY'VE CLOSED Such a huge disappointment Made lunch plans with a coworker today who suggested we try it out since we liked The Grind (next door same owner) The place was empty at 12:45 on a Friday Glad it wasn't crowded but it could have been a sign of things to come We had a pleasant waiter who seemed excited to see us We started out by ordering the Stuffed Biscuit Bites because the description seemed great: Chorizo Manchengo Cheese Garlic Cream Sauce and Herbs We were told it was taken off the menu because it didn't really taste very good So we decided to try the Fried Pickle Chips instead I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of chips and my friend ordered the pulled chicken and a side salad Let's start with the Fried Pickle Chips They were terribly sour dill slices cut way to thick with the batter sliding off each one Just dreadful When the sandwiches arrived we were taken aback by how little meat was on each one At $8 we could have used a few more ounces It was probably less than 3 oz of meat The barbecue chicken was flavorless and oddly textured The pulled pork was slightly better but very bland They were both pretty dismal Luckily our waiter brought over some Madison's Habenaero sauce by a local bottler It is very tangy mildly hot and a bit sweet If it weren't for this the sandwiches would have been left uneaten.
Technically I only stayed here for twenty minutes but it was a memorable twenty minutesThe motel sounds amazing: free breakfast a social hour in their "club" pool pillow top mattresses flatscreen TVs and a free airport shuttle  But when you actually get there    Let's see: I arranged for the shuttle in advance giving them my arrival time and flight number  And waited and waited  And called the hotel where they seemed to have no idea what I was talking about  So they said they would send the shuttle  The motel is about ten minutes from the airport  It took the guy 45 minutes to pick me up  The shuttle was not clean the seats were split and chunks of foam were coming out the seat belts felt greasy  The driver to be blunt had not showered in days  Then we got to the motel which was clearly a very old motor lodge that had been repainted (you could see faded letters under the paint from the previous name)  Despite having made reservations weeks before and having just called them about the shuttle they did not have a room ready for me    were not sure they had a room for me at all  I sat in the lobby for half an hour waiting while the women at the desk chatted to each other about getting their nails done which is apparently code for finding me a room  The lobby smelled so strongly of cigarette smoke that it made me nauseated after a few minutes and there was ash on several of the chairs  Two teenage girls came in claiming they had lost their room key    after listening to them try to figure out what room they were in and the name of the "guy they knew who was letting them stay there" I'm pretty sure they were prostitutes  And judging from the conversation of the desk clerks after they left I'm pretty sure the clerks knew it too BUT THEY GAVE THEM THE SPARE KEY  While I was waiting a friend who had stayed at the motel the night before (we were both in town on business) texted me and said not to check in  She had had a group of teenagers outside her room all night playing music and smoking pot  She'd called the front desk to complain and eventually the police  There had been hair in her shower and something sticky on the sink and she had checked out that morning exhausted and appalled  But right then they said my room was ready so I took the key and went up  The rooms all had outside doors which always makes me feel unsafe when I travel alone and on their website the room pictures are all of inside hallway rooms  The door to my room was bent and didn't close properly I had to lean my full weight against it to get it locked and realized that it was bent that way because it had been kicked in  The room was tiny and smelled like mildew  The bed and bedding appeared to be new but the tiny desk and dresser were very old and scratched  In fact the desk was weird in general: being about four feet wide but not deep enough to set a laptop on   A quick look at the bathroom showed that it had not been cleaned and there was no wastebasket anywhere in the room  I could hear every car passing on the street outside and people talking in the next room as clearly as if they were standing next to me  Oh Hell NoFrom my window I could see the Holiday Inn Express across the street  I called them and found out that their rooms (studio suites no less) were twenty dollars cheaper and made a reservation  I gathered up my things and checked out  They actually tried to charge me but I just LOOKED at the woman and said firmly The room was filthy the door didn't close all the way and nothing here is as advertised and she let me go  I later got an email from the motel with a picture of that same room saying Isn't it clean now  Wouldn't you like to come back  I said no.
I stopped in on my way home from work to get an oil change  I didn't have an appointment but it was 3 on a Wednesday and I didn't see a single car in the shop  I wasn't greeted as much as sneered at  Of course he couldn't fit me in for a 30 minute oil change without an appointment so I asked if there were any other locations  He informed me that no one would be able to do same day oil changes  Really  Mid-day Mid-week  He was totally dismissive and completely unhelpful  I agree with the other comments that he quickly sized me up as being an "oil change coupon" customer and decided the owner didn't need my money I've been to this Midas location in years past and had a COMPLETELY different experience   I'll never go back to this location.
So half way through a pretty good breakfast one of six of us found a hair on our food The waitress said she would remove it from the bill As the check arrived we noticed the manager took off 10% I asked to speak to him and basically got into an argument over him removing a nine dollar breakfast item We were all pretty mortified to be treated so poorly They definitely lost 6 customers Fail.
No customer service No sense of urgency  Was told by the manager of this place I was going to get a phone call back in 10 mins that was a failure  The longest 10mins of my life Am yet to get a call back.
Never Again (at this location)Friday night was rough  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3  I was spent and needed a little sustenance  Taco Bell is almost closed so where else to go  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger  WhatamistakeCome to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (ie undercooked meat etc) but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru getting a single burger should not have taken this long  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional 45 cents for but wait they neglected to put it on at allAfter taking one bite it all became clear  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes  Gross   Never Again.
OK I read other reviews for Harbor freight and I've come to the conclusion that we don't care about quality anymore we want cheap That's what you get here CHEAP No Quality As I said I shop there too but I try to be careful what I buy there and not expect much For instance I bought a generator and paid $20 for a 2 yr warranty First one went bad after the 3rd or 4th use (about 2 months) I took it back and got generator number 2 That one never worked at all When I took that one back they informed me that the 2 yr warranty is good for one exchange and I would have to pay another $20 for a new 2 yr warranty (THAT'S NOT A WARRANTY) I managed to get the last one without paying the $20 (not sure how that worked out) The other option was to return for refund but there would be a 20% restocking feeWOWCHEAP CHINESE GARBAGEMostly.
What a disaster  I don't get the love of this place at all  I'll agree with Patrick L on this one: William-Sonoma with a hot case  That's all this is  Where do I beginFirst - the layout  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon this place had 30 people in it and was insane  The layout does not help  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases  It is really a nightmareSecond - quality for the price  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay  I have no issue with high end products but  where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less  There is nothing special about what you stock  You don't make these cheeses yourself  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs Trader Joes and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in townFinally - You call that a deli counter  The girls working here have probably been using a meat slicer for 2 months and couldn't tell you the difference between mortadella and sopressata  I'm sure they don't know how to cook it and can guarantee that they don't know proper pairingsNo thanks  I'll stick with Delicious Dishes in Phoenix and keep my money local.
Very bad service food so-so DO NOT use a credit card They will tack on more money after you signed and you won't see it until you check your bank statement Only thing good about this place is the mechanical bull.
DISHONEST STAFF & TWO SEPARATE BUNGLED HOTEL EXPERIENCESThis was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed No call back from management They sent an e-mail bot "how was your stay" only THEN a manager calls I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experienceWhen I called to book Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room Yes 3 calls I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds I said that doesn't work for my wife and I She then tells me one king is available but for like $3500 more So yes there was one available they just want to extort some extra $ So I'm thinking "This place screwed up badly begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed" On that note integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff  If one thing happens well meh 2 things happen its alarming 3 and 4 things happen well I'm pissed off The pool bartender was nice I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1 Yea I hear folks screaming "What are you complaining about" Well it's dishonest and it's stealing I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I This experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought My wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $5000 charge was So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka I assured her that we did not drink it She said it would be refunded I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said "Well obviouslysomebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number or anything could have happened But we'll get it sorted out for you" I said "OK Please do" and guessed that was the end of it  I also wasn't very satisfied with the "anything could have happened" explanation To me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge That's dishonest My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor I was never reimbursed  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked "What was the issue" and in a somewhat curt tone I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't He then said in a snarky fashion "Fine if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it Nice way to treat your customers Well guess what Yea Brian never reversed the charges Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't feels really dishonest at this point It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a "charge dispute" was time consuming and once again irritating I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling.
I only give one star because they had decent meat We went at 2 PM and they had no salads we got our sandwiches and it was all just meat bread and cheese we will never be going back to this place again.
Okay it wasn't THAT bad  As others mention Counter Girl was a little icy: didn't greet us when we walked in didn't thank us after our order didn't ask if we'd like fries w/ that Burgers were okay and came w/ a small floppy pickle  Of the 25 or so words illuminated on the somewhat tacky sign that serves as the cramped modern/minimalist restaurant's only art warm was the only that could be applied to the main course  Not lip-smacking or delicious  WarmModerate outdoor seating area off to the side  Wheelchair accessible w/ minimal finagling  Pricing comparable to the Carl's Jr $6 burgerDefinitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend but it wasn't the worst place I've ever eaten.
Unfortunately you cannot give negative stars  Pizza was so late I would have had to order it 2 days ago for it to get here on time  From the time I ordered till delivery was 1 hour and 45 minutes  Got the pizzas free but there barely warm and soggy bottoms  As far as I am concerned they should give us the next 4 orders free  I would go elsewhere but we like Dominoes Pizza  Our previous complaint was about the manager who insisted he could not give us the order free well we got the order free tonight so the Manager Singh is a liarmy previous complaintOne very nasty and rude manager named Singh  WILL NOT LET A CUSTOMER COMPLAIN AND VENT  All he has are excuses  Hello I am a customer let me vent then ask me what can he do to correct this  Nope he has to interrupt you  This man needs a course in customer service  t hate the service.
This place has gone downhill since Sprouts has taken over this location The service is horrible now With 6 or 7 employees behind the deli counter I was ignored like I wasn't even there Finally an ugly little toad came over and asked me what I wanted When I told him a sandwich he flipped a pad to me and said fill it out When I asked for a pencil the toad just walked away Meantime the other 6 employees milled around like they were too busy to help the growing line behind me Finally I just left and did my shopping for the weekend at Whole Foods Whole foods charges a little more but the experience and quality are un-matched by this Sprouts location.
Stopped by to try this place after work I waited to be greeted at the front for over 5 minutes  Finally a man (who I later learned was the owner) told me in a very abrasive tone to sit anywhere I want  Then a hostess came over and sat me near the back (I asked for a quiet table I began looking at the menu when the owner came back to me and told me that I could not sit there  He said it was too far for the waiters to walk to me  I laughed thinking he was kidding He continued to things like hurry up come on you are moving seats  He resat me near the bar and when on to harass another customer  I left before anyone else could talk to me  Crazy man.
Probably the WORST food I have ever paid for.
They do NOT match their on-line prices I was NOT impressedI reserved a book on-line for my daughter and since I dropped my wife off at work across the street from this location I waited the 30 minutes I had to for them to open  That was my choice and no big deal what was a big deal was the attitude when I got inside  I went the customer service counter to get the book I reserved and was told that it was at the checkout counter I go the the checkout counter and when it couldn't be found and I explained that I had just reserved this morning the sales lady got rather rude and asked if I had gotten an e-mail that it was ready  I was then advised that it was at customer service  I explained that I was at customer service and was told it was supposed to be there  So with continued rudeness I was told that since I had just reserved it on-line it was still at customer service desk as they had not had time to bring it to the front  Wow it must have been my fault for reserving it on line and arriving to soon after-wards to get itI asked about the $200 difference in price and was told they do not match on line prices  The "excuse" I was given was their "overhead" was higher  I was born at night but it wasn't last night and I do not for a minute by that line of BSFor for these reasons I'll buy either second hand books or from independent book stores  I'm tired of corporate America's attitude that I'm here for the sole purpose of giving them my money to make them even richer.
Stayed here with a friend for a few nights just passing through I managed to forget my laptop charger in the room It is an Apple laptop charger which run about $80 per I immediately called as soon as I realized and was on the road an hour away So i asked that I could please be charged to mail it to California The first girl I spoke to laughed at me on the phone but did say she found it I had 3 different people tell me they had it in their hands I gave all my info and everything and now they said it was never found Call me paranoid but it sounds like somebody got themselves a brand new charger.
I went to this hotel and I will NEVER stay here The female/male who was working the desk was a total bitch Plus over charge for stuff snacks Friend was staying here and she didn't like the person who was working the desk Not a welcome feeling at this hotel.
So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed  Packets of mayonnaise Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendorsWent back tonight and had the fish tacos (because i had a gift card to use up) wow  they were amazing I would so go back and have the fish tacos anytime.
I can't even give this place a one star  The food was digusting  I ordered half of the rack of ribs  They were smeared in bbq sauce which is my fault as I failed to advise that I like my sauce on the side  The rib meat was gross and tasted OLD  I can't believe what I experienced yesterday afternoon  My sides were also terrible  I don't like my beans to taste sweet with bbq sauce  I was expecting more of cowboy bean taste  The potato salad was not my cup of tea and over peppered  I didn't care about the sides as much as those darn ribstasting so old  It appeared all they did was cook the ribs and then throw sauce on themgross and filthy tasting   I have eaten at Honey Bears on Van Buren over the years and loved it each time Sorry but the food at this Tempe Honey Bears location was out right terrible  This location is very nice and new but obviously they don't know how to cook and used expired meatgross  I was so looking forward to great bbq that I always experienced at the restaurant on Van Buren  I will never return.
Very upset with the service an way of handling their customers  Was charged 2500 to try and check in at 2 pm instead of 3 pm when half the hotel was empty  Room was 92 degrees when we walked in and had to wait about 2 hours for the room to cool off on a day where the high was nearly 115 degrees  Checked out the following morning and after 5 days saw a charge on my credit card for 15000  Apparently I was charged for a door lock that was damaged by someone who satyed there before me No call or contact by the hotel management was ever made just charged my card and figured I would never see the charge on my card I suppose Horrible.
Yes the owner is really nice and they do have a really old grocery store (which means most of the ethnic stuff they are selling are old)But commenting on the food I had the baba ganoush and the Kefta kebab The ganoush was bitter (methinks came out of can with citric acid and other preservatives imparting the bitter taste)The Kefta wasn't that bad (but I have had better) however the: tzatziki enveloping the kefta was bitter I have found the same phenomenon in Spices on the other side of 101 Either that is how it is made or else they both are using canned stuff to feed to us.
I waited over a year to re-try this place The theory was: If they stayed in business this long maybe they've fixed things The menu is better with more selections Service is slow which doesn't mix well with airport crowds There are too many tables per sq foot and people consistently walk into table Good place to go if the world runs out of restaurantsFood was 2 starService 1 starAmbiance 1 star (because zero isn't permitted).
I went to lunch here at Ra on Ray 2/18/13 with a co worker The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for "Nichole" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her so she takes our drink order Finally my salmon carpaccio comes luke warm and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when "Nichole" walks up grabs the bowl and says "are you finished" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating so she tells her to go ahead and take it It has been 35 minutes now NO drinks and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found So we just walked out LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather "NO" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's    PS the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :(.
I had a very upsetting experience with Tony there  I negotiated with him for an iron table with a glass top and showed a high level of interest  He agreed on his price he suddenly said that I would have to buy the glass separately  This is crazy - why would somebody buy the glass separately if that is what the surface is already made out of  Shady approach to doing business and poor customer service  Getting nicer quality and better customer service at AZ Iron Furniture.
What a disappointment I went here because of all the great reviews but maybe I went on the wrong day The greeter was kind no up-sell cashier was kind as well Problem is I came here to get my car washed as well Windshield left full of bugs rear seats not vacuumed rear windows had smudges and cup holders left full of crumbs Really No attention to detail or pride in the job they do.
So I've eaten at this restaurant before However the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening So we booked a reservation at this restaurant WHICH THEY CONFIRMEDWhen we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored but we were welcome to order a drink at the bar  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice Interestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering there was one or two even later I eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal  I rarely write totally negative reviews But Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the clientI do agree with an earlier reviewer If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare The Salt Cellar.
First of all i would never ever  travel with grey hound never again because the buses are never clean There always trash on the bus its disgusting I was on my to Perris CA to visit my dad taking the bus on the way there was horrible the  diver was a jerk  Then on the way back to Phoenix AZ very bad experience so i pay for my daughter ticket for her own seat because she 6 years old this bus was pack some people had all there seats the diver did not said nothing but this one guy move his stuff out the way but it was only one seat so my daughter had to sit on my lap i was very mad i did not pay for my child to sit on my lap now we are all most there to Az thats when the bus diver finally did something there was a heelchiar on the bus diver he tough he can pull out some seat justva little bit ugh it was a very tight squeeze never never again then what make things worse their customers service is really ridiculous i told them i want my money back they told me they can only give me two options you can credit to your next trip or $25 cash back hell no like i said never again.
Another Groupon casualty  I bought several Groupons for this location and used only one  Then we went to go use another one the other day and *BAM* it's gone  Another one bites the dustReturn Factor - An obvious 0%.
They acknowledged our gift card indicated it had a $50 balance then said that due to 'new management' they weren't going to honor itIf it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it.
NO STARS FOR THIS PLACE We wanted to eat here only because they had charging stations for our car But guess what 2 suv's were parked in the spots and the sign clearly states NO PARKING UNLESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE  thought maybe the manager would help us out but he basically said F U Not getting my business guess I have to at least give one star but can't make a review with no stars.
These guys sold me a dishwasher that would not drain properlyMy house smelled like a sewer They said I needed to run an extra rinse and that would fix the problem Finally I called another store That solved the problem and I found out that Denny's had sold me a used machineTHEY ARE CROOKS.
DO NOT EVER GO HERE EVER CERTAINLY NOT MSG FREEDIMSUM TAKES FOREVERMADE MYSELF AND PARTY MEMBERS VOMIT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS it is also a pretty big upset when the waiter speaks zero english HAD A RAPTURE-LEVEL EVACUATION OF MY COLON AFTERWARDS THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A "THUNDERFURY".
Time warp banking Very low tech Like banking in the early '70s Ditched their checking account but kept the Visa Credi Card The free checking was nice because it would refund the fees that other banks charge for using their ATMs But the customer has to do all the work by saving the receipts and mailing to Birmingham AL Other banks offer this but the computer system keeps track and automatically rebates the fees at the end if the cycle If you complain about it the just say "This is the way we do it".
I can't believe this place closed I was so excited to write a review and use my new favorite word "douschebaggery" when explaining the scene Oh this place was so seedy Tons of guidos and I swear they LOVED to wear all whiteIf I could I would have given this place zero stars I guess I'm happy they closed down because it was a long time coming This place was so over the top The process of getting in was always annoying You'd HAVE to valet your car and then upon entry there would be way too many people bombarding you in the entry way The location's a bit off the main strip of clubs in Scottsdale and I always found it weird to be on Drinkwater when I'd go out to the patio section Anyway I'm just crossing my fingers now that who ever buys the property gut the inside and make into some trendy hipster bar/lounge.
I was starving and just needed something quick before the bar so I wasn't drinking on an empty stomach  And even THAT didn't stop me from sending back my overly breaded overly cooked rock hard chicken strips and asking for a refund because I didn't even want to consider eating anything else they made  Ick  I'd rather eat at Subway and that's saying a lot.
The location is terrible The building is attached to a auto mechanic shop and it's on Van Buren and 2nd Ave There is no parking so good luck with walk to and from the venue If you are over the age of 22 this is not the place for you The place is full of loud mouthed young kids and is not at a place to relax and listen to music I don't recommend the venue for adults and professionals however if you are 18 and loud mouthed this is your place Adults and professionals stick with Scottsdale Also a warning to professionals there was a heavy marijuana presence so if you need to avoid this don't attend.
Says they have 24hr automated postal service Perhaps they do but you would have to make it past the locked doors after hours to find out Staff is typical USPSrude don't care attitude and doing as little as possible to be helpful I bet they wonder why the USPS loses an approximated $25 MILLION dollars a day I hope the USPS goes BANKRUPT and every single one of them lose their job.
We have an issue with All Stars Sports Bar Make that twoFirstly just because you are one of the few liquor licensees within the airport it doesn't give you permission to stock only the cruddiest of beers Coors Bud Light and Sam Adams Oh pleaseSecondly the Wendy's fast food next door serves equal or better food than All Stars for half the price and twice the efficiencySo here's how I came to the above two conclusionsSunday early evening at PHX It has been a long week in AZ and I desperately wanted a beer and dinner before getting on the planeJust like when you're at any sports venue I do expect to pay through the nose for that beer at the airport But given my recent experiences that beer does NOT have to be a cruddy mass commercial brand Take note PHX - tiny little PDX serves local micro brew brands right at the gate So does SFO That is supporting local businesses and leaving your visitors with a wonderful last impressionNext the food My expectations were low I'm totally cool with burgers hot dogs and fries But when the burger patty came out it honestly looked like a fast food burger vs something I'm paying $15 for That didn't bode well given there were plenty of fast food options I could have gone withThe server was nice enough but not very efficient She was holding my plastic silverware (oh yes everything is served on plastic) WHILE talking to another customer I was puzzledBottom line: DON'T EAT HERE Grab a to-go from the fast food or sandwich places If you must have a beer then go ahead it's more about the experience of chatting with fellow travelers vs getting an interesting beer.
I used to like the Carne Asada then one day I got a Toe nail in my burito So Gross I want to puke thinking about it I quit going for several months and went back our of desperation late at night This time got a carne Asada again and this time with the time of someones fingernail So gross NEver again If you like mystery meat then you would like this place GROSS.
I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience hereHadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food Went today to see if anything has changed NopeGave us tots instead of fries Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED If this is how they make them now um alright They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog Makes it harder to eat Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the pictureGoodbye forever Sonic.
A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food) we decided to give Wong's Place a shot  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce  Neither of the dishes were really that great  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd preferAnd to seal the deal a classmate of mine whom I saw working there later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly "recycle" the rice there  You got it the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to youIf you're looking for legit Chinese food you're better off going somewhere elseEdit: Based on recent reviews perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:1 Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)2 Panda Express3 Subway4 FilibertosAs you can see while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's  Please just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else.
They just phone it in  On top of that they bother the heck out of you to spend more money there and then they take so long to finish that you're in too big of a hurry to notice just what a lousy job they have actually doneThis review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the yearsI lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice  In the mid-nineties the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart  I had noticed Danny's all over town and decided to give them a tryThey were spectacular in those early years  I got great service everyone was friendly and you didn't have those annoying "how about a detail oil change upgrade to first class" upselling as you drove up  You chose you paid you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up niceThen somebody got greedy  At first there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff sometimes two-to-three times  I fended them off at first but they became so persistent that I complained and well I got a bewildered "it's our right to make money" attitude from them so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperateCut to the present  I came back this last weekend to visit family and my volvo wagon was a mess  Kid dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by  Bought the "Royal" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other sideWell after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done  Or at least to their standardsBut not mine oh heaven's no  There was still bird poo on the roof  When I pointed this out the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away he just shrugged his shouldersWe were in  a hurry at this point so we just got in and sped off  But wait there's more  While we were driving back to the house we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any "not so hard to reach" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies but there was still TRASH in some of the places  Looking around more I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been "protected" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors the dash top and that's about it  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean and the back seats were still dry as a bone  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble TelescopeBut they are totally phoning in the work on the family car  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have  I still feel it should get the same attention especially at $30.
I went there with my friend who really likes it  I ordered  an $850 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal  She said in a snotty put-upon voice "Well we weight the meat for every sandwich  Every sandwich gets four ounces"  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said "do you want more meat"  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said "Yes"  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place.
OK so what if it's an authentic 1950s ice cream parlor The stuff they're scooping up is boring major brand-name label ice cream full of air and the toppings are nothing special And the wallpaper is dirty and faded And the carnival-esque decor is kinda creepy unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here staring sadly off into space as their ice cream sodas melt away You can almost imagine the opening scenes of a tear-jerker Lifetime movie set here That's not good.
I went shopping at the Michael's located at 16239 N Scottsdale Rdin Scottsdale Arizona this morning I was looking for a specific craft for my geriatric aunt I walked into the store and thought I had lucked out right away when I saw an associate a few feet away from me I said "excuse me could I ask for your help" her response was a BIG sigh with "ugh" noise an annoyed look and an extremely sarcastic "SUUUUURE of COURSE" and made an overly dramatic show of putting down the items she was holding as if I were bothering her horribly I was totally appalled at her behavior I apologized to her saying I wasn't trying to interrupt her activities but I needed some help finding a specific craft She responded by ROLLING HER EYES at me and asking for the item description At this point I was just trying to get through my interaction with her so I could find the item but her body language and behavior were so hostile I had to stop and I asked her why she was being so rude to me in response she started listing how busy she was I cut her off saying I would find someone else to help me since she was taken with other duties I found a manager (I believe her name was Jen or Jenny) and relayed my difficulties with the previous associate She was somewhat polite but was obviously eager to get the convo over with She was nice enough to listen to my item description and show close examples of what was in stock to me But I was still extremely dissatisfied with the lack of skill when it came to addressing the previous associate's HORRIBLE customer service Jen simply offered an "I'm sorry" about the associate's behavior I have been a loyal shopper of Michael's for years and have never had such horrible service I doubt I will be back to this location anytime soon Joann's anyone.
Very little value  We had been customers for the past 15 years  Under it's current management it's a complete ripoff.
The beauty of Chicago is the huge selection of ethnic foods we get to sample  So I was disappointed with the Greek selection Glendale has to offerFalafel had a weird grimy taste to it  Texture wasn't all there  Gyros were dry  Yogurt sauce accompanying it blandThey tried they failedMISERABLY.
The service was horrible The TV was on a station showing a deer being hunted and killed All in all a terrible experience.
Was not impressed at all I wouldn't call this a Gourmet Burger and they are expensive didn't like the way the meat tasted too salty and the french fries were ok we ordered the RosemaryOlive oil and Garlic fries my husband loves Burgers but we will not go back   this was the second time we had tried themI will say the Staff was Great too bad their Burgers are not Great We would rather go to In In Out or Five Guys  They have really Loud Music playing also which is not very pleasant my husband and I could barely hear each other talk .
We wrote Linda an email about 2 weeks ago explaining we are switching all of our insurance to someone else beginning the 23rd of November (we got the exact same homeowners insurance at Allstate for almost $200 less dollars) and how we felt and she or someone else in her office never even replied.
It wasn't for me I generally like middle eastern food  I got the sampler to go  babaganesh falafel taheni humus with pita Everything was very bland The pita and falafel were chewy I ended up throwing most of it out.
If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less ickyI seriously don't understand the draw of this place  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table  Other reviews claim much longer wait times  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs bacon and hashbrowns  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table  Unfortunately my boyfriend's bread had a little something extraa nice long hair  Disgusting  Never again.
Valley Metro used to offer student passes to my college This summer they got greedy and failed to make a deal with my school So if I bought their summer semester pass it would cost $40 more than if I just paid full-fare every day Taking advantage of full time students who have no income is just as shameful as preying on the elderly on fixed income  SHAME ON VALLEY METROValley Metro used to be a convenient way to read on my way to class in the morning Then they made the trains shorter with only 2 cars instead of three Now there are more people paying full fare to ride the train but they haven't increased capacity so everyone has to stand all day long They say they aren't making enough money to run more trains but more people are paying full fare than there was before (it's a hallow excuse) SHAME ON VALLEY METROValley Metro devised a system to pay for your ride by pre-paid train passes but if you forget to activate your pass outside the train as you're running to catch the train you could get a $500 ticket Just to re-cap even though you've already bought your pass in advance you can still get a $500 ticket -That's a ridiculous system  They could have allowed us to validate our tickets on the train in case we're running latebut no it's better to hassle people on the train with their lame security detail (Gestapo) who get their jolleys interrogating average people  SHAME ON VALLEY METROThe sign says it takes a half hour to go from Tempe to Phoenix on the light rail That's complete and total hog-wash no matter what time of day it is I live 1 mile from the train station on an average day I expect to spend 15 hours each way on my commute It's a 55-65 minute train-commute into Phoenix from Mill Ave to Indian School Add on the fact that  I usually wait at the platform for about 10 minutes because even though they are supposed to come every 10 minutes they never do Then add because the intersection is a gauntlet at Indian School (because of the train station is in the middle of Central ave instead of one side or the other) it takes me another 10 minutes to get from the train to my building across the street Why -poor planning SHAME ON VALLEY METROThen there are times where the trains are overloaded but they don't send 3 car trains to fit all the people Examples: Central High School lets out the same time every day and 300 kids flood the train Baseball games downtown cause a flood of the train When there's an expo downtown I can't get on the train in the morning because it's too full the trains run slower and I'm late for my 8:30am class (when I leave at 7am) Valley Metro fails to consider it's environment SHAME ON VALLEY METRONO I'm not thankful of having a train that hardly goes anywhere and costs too much BETTER transit is everywhere (except LA)   BART has been in San Francisco for years and is cleaner nicer and cheaper You only pay for as far as you ride So you only pay for what space you actually use If you go one stop everyday it's not expensive at all The Buses in Seattle run clean on electric lines on some streets and are much more efficient than anything we use in AZ In Sydney the buses are more efficient because they run the traffic lights so the buses don't have to stop at them The Valley Metro system is lame and costs too much SHAME ON VALLEY METROIt's our own fault for voting for people who pass useless laws and can't balance a budget to save their lives AZ has been putting mass transit on the back burner for decades If you want more tax dollars get the working class to work on time efficiently SHAME ON THE AZ VOTERS AND VALLEY METROALSO the light rail could prevent people from driving drunk by operating just a little later If the trains operated until 3am all the patrons of Tempe and downtown Phoenix night life could get home safe no worries Instead we pay (taxpayer $) for expensive DUI checkpoints It's a simpler solution that's more efficient and will encourage patronage of local businesses Keep the train on later so it's useful and PREVENTS crime  SHAME ON VALLEY METRO and the silly police departments with reactionary tactics.
No parking  Unfriendly staff except bartender  He was trying but quite marginalOMG  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB REALLY  Not our first time gave this place chances after chances before writing it off  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes after 20 minutes went by another 15-20 minutes etc  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us  Wasn't greeted when we entered not even a "Hi can I help you"Wait area outside or in the bar area  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area  I don't have a big carThe bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendlyWell the mango margarita at $12 was okay Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad one appetizer 1 sandwich 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner  2 beers  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got  So check your checksNo one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voicesThe female waitress again seemed like she was having a bad dayor life Had no interest in our opinions about the food plates were plopped down on the tables she came to check on us twice 2nd time the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10 Service and the meals didn't match the prices Ouch  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket.
eeew It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials then I should have read them on the board The food was downhill from there The entire place smelled like fried onions.
i went in to purchase stamps  I was not told how much the service charge would be beforehand and didn't know until it was rung up  I didn't look at the stamps until I got back to my office and found that all of the stamps were at the old rate of $45  Now I have to go to the post office and purchase $01 stamps  Hopefully they are informed and using the current rates for their other shipping services.
This has been one of my regular spots for Italian beef since the 90's  My trip today will be my last   Luke's used to have their own beef that was tasty  Well today they used some frozen Vienna beef that was like rubber taste was not nearly the same and the color was off  This made me sad since I've been a long time customer  This isn't the first example of them cheapening out  I guess I will have to go through the trouble of making my own Italian beef and will have to find a good jar giardiniera.
Wings were good (not better than others) Service was good except :::: Like the airlines they are nickle and dime you  They ask :"carrots or celery ranch or blue cheese"  What they don"t ask is you will pay for them $60 each for 3 celery stocks and a small cup of dressing  It add over $400 to our bill  Sorry Buffalo on to the next hunting grounds   Did I add too loud to talk.
We're so done with this placeYears ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointmentsA couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold tasteless food A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another tryToday we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone We sat in the self seating area near the bar Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her She apologized and took the glasses A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said "Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay" Are you effing kidding me Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold and absolutely tasteless We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left Seriously if you're looking for a fabulous burger great beer excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please take the time and go to the San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area You won't be disappointed As my dad would say they could sell their burgers in India they're so good http://wwwsantanbrewingcom/However if you're in Tempe and don't want to drive all the way to Chandler (and okay with fighting for parking) try Four Peak's Brewery they're also fantastic  http://wwwfourpeakscom/.
Normally I love this place but today management failed They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons Its not like the Derby came as a surpriseNever coming back for a special event here I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again.
I heard so many great things about it I stopped once with my family to find that they only took cash but didn't have an ATM in the lobby So I went back when I was on my way to school to grab something and got a seriously bad stomach ache Very disappointed.
Food is terrible Ordered a rueben and what I got was burnt soggy bread with tsp of cabbage slaw and rubbery deli meat  Service was lacking even though the restaurant was empty on a busy Saturday at the Mall  (should have been a warning) The manager erased the bill but left me lacking for a real rueben.
NEVER  go for anything other than a hangnail Then make sure your manicurist goes with you  Didn't follow through with test ordered  Would not admit error  I'm not sure what medical schools these Drs graduated from but coming from a medical family wouldn't let my dog go there (if I had one)  I'll make sure to pay any co-pay the same way they followed through with my tests.
DO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE EXTENSIONS  This girl tossed my hair so much while shampooing it got so tangled and matted Then even after I mentioned "why don't you just use a detangler" she ripped through my hair with a brush pulling and tugging She even pulled out like 4 of my extensions I have the plastic tube extensions (shrinkies) too so they're very easy to wash and style.
Damn I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in PhoenixIT DOESN Tnow I m from Texas and in all my 62 years  i have not had a more greasysoggylimp chicken fried steakYUCKwhat a load of crap this thing was The rest of the place was a  dumpthe bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothessmall is the wordI would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thingsave your money and time go back to Texas every now and then go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILLI have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves insteadlazy @#$%'s.
I ordered a burrito from here and the sour cream was literally curddled into a cottage cheese looking substance I got a couple bites in before I saw it and I immediately almost vomitted along with everyone around me that saw it Never again will I dine there you don't even get the chance to make a mistake like that again in my book I did not get sick thank God but still gross.
Creepy customers.
To start with I tried 'Idli' (with Chutney and Sambar) The Idli was way off course and actually didnt taste like one The chutney probably had 10% coconut (as compared to 100% coconut that I have come across many Udupi Cafe's across US) and the Sambharabsolutely pathetic Moving to main course all the curries were highly reduced and were not that delectable I am keeping this review short and sweet because you cant write much about how pathetic food was for the price that I paid I am never going back to this place any time in my life.
Plain and simple this place sucks The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress I ordered a steak medium rare I was given a burnt piece of meat I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten This place can't do food or entertainment The entertainment was called Envy What a joke They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful No accounting for taste If you go to Scottsdale take a pass on this placeits overpriced What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ Or and they should invest in a better chef.
I used to go into this location as a kid and i loved it everyone was so nice to me and wouldnt hesitate to offer suggestions to help me improve one time they talked me out of buying a new kickstand for my mountain bike because they said it might fall but more recently i feel very ripped off every time i go to landis I was charged 40 bucks for them to install a bike computer(the mounting was already in place) and it took them ten minutes and three zip ties and even more recently i went in for brake work and they said they were going to do an entire brake job and they were going to replace all of the brake cable housings when i got it back i realized that they had only replaced two of them but bumped up to cost of each so it was still the same ammount of money it is sad that this place is now about profit versus genuine customer service and for that reason i will be taking my bike elsewhere (slippery pig etc).
Haven't eaten yet but ordered a mojito from the bar and it was really bad Too much simple syrup and only 2 small bar-slices of lime I had to pour in a whole tall glass of soda water to make it drinkable When the hostess brought us to the table it was obvious that it hadn't been wiped down We just ordered May have an update laterOK just finished the meal Mongolian Beef was good my chicken dish was also too sweet and the vegetables were so over-cooked that they were mush Rice was hard on top like it had been put in the single serving bowl over an hour prior to being brought to our table Garlic-chile noodles were just OK Not a single piece of fresh garlic or red chile flakes even though we asked for extra spicy And even that dish was slightly sweet   What is with all the sugary sweet sauces in this place  Check for 2 with 2 cocktails and tip was around $75  I could have had 2-3 great meals at my regular place for Chinese (see my other reviews) - oh well lesson learned.
Worst Nail place EVER i created a yelp account just to let people know of the HoRRIBLE service i had there i was told i was sensitive after being hurt with the electric file thing 3 times the last time i started bleeding i told the nail guy"you say i'm sensitive i'm bleeding technician was such a jackass he also cut my nails the size i wanted them and filed them so much they are not even long at all i will post pics DO NOT WASTE your time or $ here.
Just to make this clear on how bad this place sucks for karaoke I am on my iPhone right now while I am here to right a review I got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause I heard this place was awesome for karaoke Little did I realize HOW wrong everyone was I walk in and my ears start to bleed The singers were a collection of the worst singers I've eve heard The crowd was mainly made up of people twice my age and I'm 26 The drink specials were decent but the bar was SMALL  There are MAYBE 10 tables in the whole bar I will NEVER come back here unless for some reason I really want to feel better about myself.
Ive been to many Texas Road houses across the country but this one was very dissapointing The food was cooked sloppily my steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was overdone and chewy and grisly my side of rice was overcooked and tasted like mush The waitress forgot everything we would ask for and had to come back several times for something as simple as steak sauce The only redeeming factor is the bread was always delicious and amazing as usual.
First time I visited store they weren't open when posted  This was not convenient for myself or the other customer  I left after waiting 15 minutes.
Disappointed  This place is a half step up from a Subway  I sure it's ok for those who have not had the experience of a true New York Deli  The confusion of where to place an order was the first thing I noticed as well as the next three unlucky customer's  A deli that does not serve fries what's up with that Sorry Jason's Deli you flunked the test.
The food tasted fine but no veggies cheap cheap cheap with the rice No sauces with dishes to put on that bland rice The dinner portions were smaller than a kids meal at pei Wei We ordered the 4 course and both left hungry I said something and the waiter agreed it was a rip off but nothing happened I even left the promo behind for a free appetizer next time I was fuming at the price and skimpy portions so I called and talked ton a manger who invalidated the complaint and did not seem to care So the ne star is for those cutting back portions but wanting to pay $20 a person for kids meals.
Not vegetarian friendly They will not deviate from their menu to make the simple substitutions required to make vegetarian options They are over priced My bf says their meat stuff is tasty Store never looks very clean and employees don't go out of their way to be friendly or helpful.
worse excuse for beef noodle soup  just disappointingsoup was off-flavor nothing close to Taiwanesenoodles were soggy meat was overcooked like you left it in the broth cooking for awhile.
I agree with Cody from Florence   This is the worst customer service (actually lack of) that I have ever encountered  I went there to shop for a baby shower gift  I printed my list from the registry kiosk and stood there trying to figure out the layout (different areas of the store) of the store to find the items i was looking for  The list seemed to make sense but I couldn't locate the section it was telling me to go and very few of their aisles were numbered (not enough to figure out which direction i should go in)  An employee was actually at the end of one of the aisles i was looking in and i was searching very hard for my item and could not find it  I was waiting to see if she offered to help me  she did not i had to ask  I told her what i was looking for showing her the list and she says (sarcastically) "well its right here but of course the price on the display was NOT the price on the registry list She told "well it is the item" and it was the price listed on the registry  So i said well the sign on the display is incorrect then so that was misleading to me   she pulled out her pricing gun put a new tag on the display (with quite a lot of noise) and said very sarcastically "have a nice day" and stomped away  Another customer and I just looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders  So onward I go throughout the store trying to find the location of another item and not finding the aisle  Couldn't find any employees and I went to ask the cashier if she could direct me  She said "just look at the numbers on the end of the aisle"  of course they were not there   She came to see that for herself and said "i don't know why they are not there you'll have to just go look for it"  Finally my shopping completed I went to the register area--no cashier at any of the registers but i see the previous cashier at the customer service desk on the computer with her back to the area  Excuse me i said several times finally she turns around to acknowledge me and says are you ready to check out  very rudelyI will NEVER go back into that store EVER.
Not my favorite place in the world I love in and out they by far have the best burgers Lennies burgers is alright but if you really want a real good burger you go to burger bar in Vegas.
Gross microwaved food slow service cheap salsa beans are watery mess Bean dip is awfull  Much better places then this place go somewhere else for mexican taco bell would be better.
I really want to like this place but I suggest going somewhere else to eat Italian food in Goodyear like Dino's  My wife and I had eaten there several times and had so so service and food quality  We had a party for a friend where we invited people to come and eat and when everyone came (about 15 people) we ordered appetizers and then everyone ordered separately  When the time for the checks to come the server notified us that they were going to charge us $25 a persone  Some of the people and shared plates and no one ordered any alcohol  None of this was communicated to us prior to this event  We should have called the cops but we didn't this I regret  I have never even heard of a place doing something so idiotic  Our friend and I picked up the tab  So now I tell everyone to avoid this place  Oh and every time I ate there I go a case of diarrhea.
FUNGUS MOLD Expired bottled drink About to drink it Moisture and Mold on the inside of the capStore manager Peter Sung too cheap to replace it with an in-date larger bottleBottles were still on the floor as I left the store for anyone to buyDO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY HERE FUNGUS MOLD.
Al's is no more  He has apparently sold both locations  This one is now something like "Taste of Chicago"  Had a Chicago dog there and it was OK but the place has lost its charm  Al I hope you're doing OK and weren't a victim of the recession.
Needed to kill two hours on a Friday afternoon and knew I could not go wrong with a Native NewYorker Three things appeal to me when coming to one of these franchised restaurants: wifi beer and wingsI needed to work (I teach online) and there wifi was spotty at best First 10 minutes were great and then nothing Just spun and would not connect I even told my serve who just shrugged and acted like my needs were not importantI asked my server what IPAs were on tap and she looked at me like I was speaking Klingon She had absolutely NO idea what I was saying I finally had to convince her to go to the bar and write down everything on tap (not only for me but also for the next poor bloke who wanted a drink that evening) I ordered what she promised to be a Sierra Nevada IPA but definitely tasted like no IPA I ever had before in my entire life (and that's saying a lot) I would've sent it back but she would've been confused even moreWhen I got to Native's I like the wings boneless since I am usually doing a work dinner and need clean hands for my laptop I got my usual honey hot which had absolutely no kick to them and tasted a little like soggy cardboard Not good at allI watched the manager walk around and greet almost every single table around me but never came over Ever I wanted to call him over and tell him my concerns but I wasn't sure where to start & I just wanted to choke down the cardboard chug my flat acid and get the hell out of there.
DON'T EAT HERE Looked nice from the outside There were over 12 empty tables 2 couples waiting and still we were told it would be a 25 minute wait Decided to have a drink at the bar We were the only 2 people at the bar and it took 5 minutes to get a bartender (as my English friend once put it "If i don't have a drink in my hand in 30 seconds the bar is s**t" Finally seated 30 minutes later Very soggy edemame clam miso clams were chewy and the sushiI'm no sushi expert but we ordered 3 different rolls and each tasted slightly sour and "rank" Even the ginger had a very sour aftertaste To top off things we only had water and my glass stayed pretty much empty despite the waitress promising to fill it up right awaythree times And they didn't bother to clear off the dirty drink glasses something that should be rudimentary considering their drinks are over priced Overall poor service poor food qualityobviously not the only ones thinking so as the facility was more than half empty which should have been a clear sign to stay away DON'T EAT HERE.
Horrible 1 Loud noise kept me up past 4am I thought the thumping bass was bad UNTIL they started breaking down the party Slamming doors moving metal carts (in stereo -outside the window AND door) loading the truck literally until half past 4am2 Management apologized over and over but did nothing Said they would call to discuss compensation but never did3 There's a $20 service fee which amounts to chips and soda and it's kept behind the check-in counter4 Incident in restaurant below had people running from building Firefighters sirens and police everywhere Sounded like shots ringing out Phone in room rang and assumed we had to evacuate People thought there was a shooting but apparently it was firecrackers and rocks being thrown into the building Not relaxing Did not feel safe It was literally featured on the local news that night I shared a very similar experience to Barbara N I actually heard a guest at the front desk leaving say: "I want to stay at a hotel not a club" In fact this hotel does feel like a cheap cheesy club Think Tampa - not upscale Miami Also the one and only elevator is slow as molasses and most people used to stairs even when carrying luggage I would NOT return to this hotel or recommend it to anybody I know.
Let me explain the 1 star I've been to Scott's a few times before  LOVED IT I've sat outside ordered to go but never have I sat inside until last weekWas visiting with friends and we got a booth placed our orders  started to chit-chat and out of the corner of my eye I see something on the wall No Couldn't be Why yes it was your friendly neighborhood roach And he brought a friend We gals stopped talking midstream looking around to see if anyone else saw what we did Why yes our server saw the two unwelcome guests as she was standing at the food delivery window Guess what she did Nothing Until we pointed them out and rapidly moved to another tableHonestly we all were wigged out Talk about an appetite lost Too bad I had totally enjoyed Scott's up until then Most likely will not be back.
Firstly I would like to say that I love the food here each time I have visited the food has been delish However the food cannot make up for the horrid service and horrible managing We spent well over 2 hours waiting on one pizza and one salad The manager was not where in sight and the server was either very new or just not well trained I do not recommend this place based solely on service.
Disclaimer: I really tried to give Chompies a chance For really reals I give it one star for the tasty pickles given before the mealFirst off the menu is way too long and overly complicated Too many choices I watched the other diners also pore over their menus in befuddlement I had to make a snap decision or I could've read that novel all night Seeing the famous original Jewish sliders (featured on Food Network's Man vs Food so they MUST be good right) I made my decision And they come with gravy which should always be a win-win I also ordered the matzo ball appetizer and tried the potato knish Both were mostly flavorless greasy and tasted frozen The matzo app was served with a ranch dipping sauce (WHY) and the potato knish was a small lonely loaf of deep-fried sadness The rest of the meal was even more disappointing The sliders came out very quickly-- much too quickly to be freshly made They came with a side of potato wedges which tasted rather stale and definitely was frozen The sliders were larger than expected but the buns were heavily greased and required multiple napkins throughout the meal The brown gravy served on the side as well as on the sliders was nothing to write home about either -- tasted like any other gravy I guess if you like that powdered gravy mix taste I'm not sure what kind of meat was on the sliders Beef I'm guessing so as its supposed to be a Jewish style/New York delicatessen Upon further inspection the "beef" had a strange iridescent sheen a telltale sign of suspect meat Long story short I ate what I could of this sad meal and begrudgingly paid for the $30 + bill for food that I didn't like not even one bit The baked goods/gleaming dessert counter on the way out didn't even call to me as I was already feeling disgusting and ashamed of my carb-and-grease loaded meal Me turning down cannoli Yeah that's pretty bad.
I went in to this location with my three year old tonight to return a warped record that I had bought earlier in the day at the Camelback location I viewed their return policy on the website before going to make the return The website states that a return/exchange can be made at any location I went up to the counter to make my return and there was a bearded guy behind the counter I told him that I needed to return the record and he gave me a dirty look and asked "where did you buy this" with an attitude I told him at Zia and he asked which one I told him where and he stuck the record out and said again with an attitude "well then you need to bring it there"  I asked why considering that the website stated that returns could be made at any location He said that because the store had recently changed into an outlet that they couldn't take it I didn't even know that it had become an outlet He was still giving me attitude so I asked him why he was giving me this attitude Words were said back and forth between us until the store manager intervened and got in between us like he was trying to break up a fight He took the record from the employee and was holding it Instead of being professional and telling the guy behind the counter to go cool off he proceeded to tell me that I could go to a different store that they had just opened I told him that I couldn't make it there right then and how this was ridiculous  I then noticed the guy behind the counter was staring daggers at me so I asked him why he was still acting like this He then started to behave in a manner that I can only compare to a high schooler that wanted to fight He and the manager both said I "better do this and better do that"  The guy behind the counter and manager said something to the effect of "taking this outside" I then said to them "what the f are you going to do"  I was told that they were going to call the cops on me and I told them to do it They did not There was profanity going back and forth between us and the guy behind the counter said something about how I was acting in front of my daughter Why is that his business If anything I'm showing her how to deal with an insignificant asshole who works at a record store and probably will for the rest of his life  At this point another employee who had nothing to do with any of this came over and started chiming in as well I was then trying to leave  because I had had enough and attempted to get my record from the manager who wouldn't let go of it I tried taking it from him three times before I told him to give me my f'n record Then the third guy who came over told me that I wasn't allowed back Really Did you really think I was going back to your shitty record store I'll do you one better I won't shop at any of Zia's stores anymore Maybe they should think about hiring competent workers and managers and not hipsters.
My wife wanted to go there after church because it was close to the house The service as well as the food was mediocre at best So many better places  to go in Surprise Rio Mirage Cafe on Litchfield is my Favorite.
My two young boys received the worst haircuts they have ever received by separate hairstylists (if that's what you call them)  They both are trying to let their hair grow out a little longer  Both look like they have mullets  Terriblewill never go back  I could have done a better job  The old saying you get what you paid for is certainly true in this situation.
This IKEA based metro so called Vietnamese "restaurant" is the most unauthentic Vietnamese food I've ever had the displeasure of eating  I usually don't even write reviews but after $4200 and  having to ask for hot sauce and Hoison sauce - seriously you've got be kidding me is this for real  This attempt at trying to make Vietnamese an upmarket "shi shi" experience will prove to be a huge disappointment to anyone who has had real good Vietnamese Pho  It just comes across as being an overpriced faux experience (pun intended)  It's like a white guy from Peoria's attempt at making Vietnamese food - epic fail  By the way the people in the white Prius with the handicap license plate who parked in the HANDICAPPED spot - who then jumped out of their car and ran inside (losers) - should give you a good indication of the kind of place and people you'll be dealing with  Please save yourself about $2000 and find a real Vietnamese restaurant - unless your really that afraid to go outside of your comfort zone or try anything new  I will give them a one star for their decor which is completely antiseptic just like their food and serviceScathing yes do they deserve a scathing review without a doubt  I guess I'm the only one in Phoenix who has ever been to a real Vietnamese restaurant in LA or SF  Regards and happy hunting for a real Vietnamese   Jack.
I went to Tandoori Times today for lunch with six of my co-workers for lunch It was not the best Indian food I've had but it was definitely not the worst (I had the achari lamb lunch special) But my experience there was horribleMy issue with Tandoori Times was the service Our waitress did not seem to care about our table at all even though we were the largest party in the place Maybe she felt that she did not need to work for her tip since it was automatically added to our bill She never checked on us to see if we needed anything One of our party members even had to chase her down just find out where his food was after everyone else's food had shown up 10 minutes beforeShe had issues with our check and stiffed us on our change I bill was $97 Three people put in $20 another a $10 and three people asked her to charge $17 a piece on their credit cards That totals $12100 We asked for change from the cash SHE CAME BACK WITH NO CHANGE AND WALKED AWAY As we were already 30 minutes late from lunch and were in a hurry we left but she swiped a $2400 tipEven though the food was good the service was the worst I think I've ever had I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon.
I won't ever go back The food wasn't very good nor was the service But the worst part about my experience was how dirty the place is I had to ask my server to remove the sugar packets holder from the table because of how dirty it was The salt & pepper shakers same thing Totally gross The floors haven't been cleaned in some time as well I'm not usually skeeved out too easily but ICK Shame on them.
My experience here was great until about 45 minutes after I ate I devoured a golden brown waffle two crispy and moist pieces of fried chicken and still had room for a few bites of buttery grits On the way back to Mesa in the car though it all went wrong I got super sick from Lo-Lo's chicken and was holed up in bed for two days on my vacation with all the signs of food poisoning (i'll save you the gory details) I will never go back here and recommend staying away from this place despite the great reviews  It might be awhile before I can stomach any fried chicken again.
Well I was just given a good reminder of why I NEVER shop at Home Depot Holy cowstood looking at fans for a good 10-15 minutes before I had to ask for assistance though about 8 employees walked right by during that time Once I did ask for help the employee said "I would but I have to track down another customer" Rather than "I'm busy but let me get somebody to help you"  Another 4 employees walked by when I grabbed one and asked for help Not sure if it was his first day or what but I swear he knew NOTHING He was trying to look things up online and I was having to do it for him Besides if I wanted info online I could have done that from home I wanted a knowledgable sales personguess I went to the wrong place STICK TO LOWES (Not to mention LOWES SUPPORTS VETERANS AND GIVES MILITARY DISCOUNTS).
This restaurant completely mislead us  The sign outside said "Organic Menu" but we were a little concerned when we saw the lit Bud Light signs  This is apparently an organic restaurant AND a pub which seems like an odd combo  We went in and after looking at the menu we wondered where the organic food was  There was only one thing we were able to see and it was on the kids menu  We ordered and the food wasn't bad but quite expensive  My salad however was supposed to be mixed seasonal greens with heirloom tomatoes  It was Romaine lettuce with some flavorless tomatoes which was pretty disappointing  The only saving grace was the sweet potato fries and the white bean avocado spread    Overall if this restaurant didn't say it was organic and wasn't so expensive it might have received more stars.
Went to buy a 2014 4-door Fiat 500L Trekking model After advising what colors and options we wanted we were advised one was available in the valley (in storage) & would be ready for pick up next day We called the next afternoon to confirm delivery and were told the one matching was dented and/or scratched Told another matching could be brought from Vegas but it'd be several days for delivery An hour later received a call and told another found in Tempe and to come to Scottsdale by 6pm Upon arrival paperwork had both my and my spouse's names misspelled with numbers in our address transposed Dealership still wanted us to sign on the incorrect documents Waited for another 30 minutes and another salesman finally pulled up in "our" car with his two kids in back with hands on the windows Windows weren't tinted (as promised) and anti-scratch coating not on yet (per salesman) Vehicle color scheme was wrong No Trekking-style trim on vehicle either Manager then advised he could have told us the day before no vehicles matching our wants (including the dented/scratched one) was even available within 400 miles Waste of time and gas for this BAIT AND SWITCH.
Horrible service Took forever for the lady to even figure out we were standing there waiting She finally came out didn't even crack a smile and took her sweet time to wash her hands and put on her gloves Probably took her 5 minutes to make the sub Slow and unfriendly The cookie was disgusting and overcooked There was math problems written all over the bag of cookies I might add classy Don't go here.
This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get  When I first walked up and asked if they had power outlets to charge my phone while I got a beer and burger the bar tender rolled her eyes and acted like I was asking an unreasonable question  Do to the limited choices I stayed anyways but should have ran  They are not a brewing company just a bar with basic beers  The worst part of the entire experience was the burger  Completely disgusting  Do not order a burger  It was a frozen meat concoction that tasted more like fillers than beef  My came out pink all the way through and bar tender said that is how they cook them  I took two bites and could not finish it  Horrible experience and still a dead phoneerrrrwhat a waste of time and money.
Although the dental practice looks professional and clean the staff was not genuous in their concerns of my comfort Yes they said what you wanted to hear but you can tell when someone is not sincere As soon as I said I wasn't sure about coming back or my discomfort when I had my teeth cleaning they called me everyday Not to check up to see how I was doing with the tooth I originally came in for care but to see how quickly they can give up my appointment to fit in someone elseEveryday at least twice a day they called and not one of those calls or messages were to ask about my pain on the tooth That's when you know the dentist and staff isn't about your comfort and health of your teeth Yes we are all in business to make money but money comes  with success of making your patients happy not treating them like another dollar sign And to be charge more than $1200 for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous.
Worst food in 2011 and that includes food trucks and fast food It looked like an old place that had been around a long time and I usually have good luck with places like that - not htis time I had the "samon fillet" which was extremely dry and tasteless - I have had beef jerky with a higher moisture content - the best thing on my plate were the soggy unseasoned canned greenbeans My wife got the liver and onions and no one was able to eat two bites - dry gritty horrible One of my sons had the fried shrimp special and that was the only OK plate (and the only one in the family that actually finished his dinner) - it was just typical deep fried shrimp from a bag of frozen but at least it was not scr*wed up I noticed that there were many more people in the bar than the dining section so the drinks may be OK but I will never try the food again.
What not to do while trying to get into a hip happenin (please note major sarcasm there) Scottsdale club after a few too many drinks and a sassy streak running on full steam by stephy sMe: "Ohhhh shit are we goin' to da cluuuuuhb Awwwhhh yeeeahhh"(Walks up to door guy who we'll call Aggroman to protect identities of big headed ego inflated jackasses)Me: "Hey I like your emblem"Aggroman: "What"Me: "Your emblem (reaching out to tap gold emblem on macho man's blazer whilst giggling like the smart ass drunk girl I am)"Aggroman: "ID"Me: "Jeez was just saying I liked your broach sheeesh"Aggroman: (visibly aggro and motioning me in) "Go"Me: (under my breath which probably was rather loud) Dang isn't this Scottsdale what up with the attitude This ain't LA shiiiiiiit (clearly I think I'm from the hood now with my gansta speak)Inside da cluuuuub what do we find Well sadly not nearly enough scantily clad sluts I mean I go to clubs for one reason and one reason onlysluts hoochies hood rat hood rat hoochie mamas and this place was strikin out big time It did however offer up a fun variety of cougars and possums though This gave me some hope as I was also told earlier in the evening that Scottsdale has per capita the highest number of Sugar Daddy's in the nation so let's face it I wanted to meet one of those too Hey why not it was Wednesday after all and I was staying at the Valley HO :)After striking out in the Sugar Daddy and slut categories I decided to entertain myself by taking camera phone pictures of random girls dancing but apparently people are too cool to pose for fun pics like this My theory is that Girls Gone Wild killed it for everyone Thanks a lot Joe Francis Whatever I got a shot of a half nekkid girl dancing anyway so there Moral of the story Don't take me out to da cluuuuhhhb The end :).
Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour)  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up thereAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all  In fact the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacularOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go  Rather than call peers to secure us spots they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day)  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the "weather cancellation" due to insufficient bookings on Monday the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouthPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area.
Went in looking for a specific item and asked the employee on duty for her opinion - all she could say was that the more expensive ones were "better" I then walked to Target next door and found the same item for much less $$ Fail.
I have been to Someburros one other time Food was just ok I decided to today to try their breakfast burritos After waiting for 30 minutes they had forgotten my order and then lied and said that it takes a long time to cook chorizo She speaks to the cooks in Spanish to make my order and then turns to me and states said that it was not her fault then whos fault would it be Blame it on the cooks Avoid this place Poor service awful food and employees who blame others and don't even apologize when they make a mistake Eek Me thinks not.
Best Margarita  Whoa this place has a reputation that it does not deserve  Food is ordinary and inexpensive but the margaritas are overpriced and make no sense when the beer is so much cheaper here  Young stuck up Millennial 20 somethings hang out here and it is almost as if this place got transplanted off Mill Ave into Scottsdale or maybe it's just the Scottsdale ASU kids that go here because they live close by in Scottsdale with mommy and daddyCan be loud with limited seating and parking is a pain here as well.
I went here with a group of friends thinking it would be a fun night out We mostly went for bowling so we got Winter Fun Passes since it included "unlimited" bowling plus billiards gravity ropes etc To get a bowling lane we had to wait an hour and to use the gravity ropes we had to wait a half hour No big deal We reserved one lane since there were 6 of us bowling (in a group of 8) They neglected to tell us that there was a one-hour time limit on the lanes When we realized this about a half hour into our game and went to reserve another lane the lady laughed at me and said that there were 30 groups ahead of us I asked if she could give me an estimate of how long the wait would be and her reply was "A long time" When I stood there staring at her she finally said "It'll be at least a two-hour wait" We tried checking out the billiards while we waited again but the 6-8 pool tables they had were full and every employee had a different answer about how to reserve one One of them asked to hold one of our credit cards I don't think so So for the over $100 spent between the 6 of us (not including what we spent on arcade games while we waited) we got one round of bowling and one round of gravity ropes before we got tired of waiting and left That would have bought about 3 games for our entire group at AMF Very disappointing This was SO not worth it and none of us plan on coming back.
Their prices don't match online prices and they never carry the shoes advertised on sale online in the store They also do not notify you if the shoes you ordered online were not sent I waited 2 weeks for a pair and finally went to the store to complain The employee told me there was nothing he could do and that I had to call the customer hotlinewow really Makes no sense to me isn't that part of your job Anyways turns out they were out of stock and were in the process of refunding my money but no email was sent I have to give this place 1 star My experience was just terrible.
Oh man well overpriced drinks and small portions (including on drinks) makes me laugh One person in my party got crown on the rocks i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses  RIP OFFThe view is good (not great) the bull is real the servers are good people the atmosphere is typical for a steak place That is where my positive experience endsWhile scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix it was nice to see all the "mountains" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah not really mountains to me) Back to the important part everyonethe food They were greatly overpricedwell my first thought was okay priced high food must be greathmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed well they need to give a bunch of refunds The burgers my friend got looked dry and zero character It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburgeryou know that dry fake looking one Obviously the burger wasn't that huge but it looked lame The pork chop was also VERY dry Like yeah i know we are in arizona and most things are dry but leave the food out of it It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible I got the prime rib OH YEAH well thats what i thought Horse radish was old lost its pizzazz and kick They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot booo) Not sure how everyone elses food was but from viewing it i was less than impressed Oh and talk about cheapyou can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob and a skimpy helping of green beansAnd just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse I've had SOO much better before It was lacking in all areas of its lifeWant to know where you can go and get better food same ambiance and decent service (but no view of phx)Texas Roadhouseyeah i said iti am bringing a chain into the discussion I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of hereEnd of the line 1 star because the food was blech 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good serviceyup two stars(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one HA).
I approach most joints like Jolta Java as if it's going to be a four or five star experience otherwise why would I be going  So the moment I walked in to Jolta Java it had the feel of a 4 or 5 star place  My wife and I order our coffees mine was hot hers was iced  The girl making the drinks didn't really seem to know what she was doing  She had to ask another employee a couple of questions before making them  My wife's iced coffee didn't have enough sweetener in it so we had to ask for another squeeze  THEN as I'm waiting for my latte I look across the store and see two employees smooching and hugging behind the counter as if this coffee shop was their own private little romantic cabana  So now it's a three star joint  I can get over it but not too excited about itTHEN the dude Mr Schmoocher is totally obnoxious and loud with the other employees including Mrs Schmoocher calling each customer who comes in "Boss"    If the owner reads these reviews (hopefully Mr Schmoocher isn't the owner) you need to do something about this guy if you want your shop to thrive  Huge problems  And that's how it moved from a 4 or 5 star joint to a 1 star joint.
The only haircuts they are willing to give are "geometric" I should have been warned because both the manager and the hairdresser had weird chopped-off blunt haircuts My hair is wavy and could not be forced into that kind of cut even if I wanted one I asked that it be layered and wound up with short hair in back and cocker spaniel ears hanging drooply beside my narrow face I went back to try to get it corrected and wound up with attempts at the salon specialty of geometrics It is the worst haircut I have ever had but I was forced to sign a statement that I was satisfied I am not but sort of got the impression I would be tangling with mall security if I refused.
No music playing at 3:00 in the afternoon Will not dine here againThe food not so good and we all felt violated when the bill arrived Very ordinary and expensive I had the brisket burrito sounded great in the description very dry and no flavor After reading reviews might try some beverages and listen to some music(Maybe that's what its all about).
Canvas was originally Phoenix's first strip mall and my what a legacy it has left upon the Valley  Luckily it has now turned into a First Friday destination as an art space and a small concert venueWell according to the Arizona Republic in an article dated 1/31/08:-----------------------------"While the northeast corner of Third and Roosevelt Streets has previously been an open area where local artists and musicians have performed for First Friday last December was the first time in recent years organized entertainment has taken place at the venue Construction on the land which covers 90000 square feet began in October Within six months CANVAS will become a nightclub a 24-hour newsstand a grocery an art gallery and home to three restaurants and a miniature skate park"-----------------------------Seriously  This is one of the most visible spots in downtown and just about the most prime spot for a min-entertainment district  THIS kind of grass-roots activity is why Roosevelt Row will absolutely demolish the completely manufactured 'Jackson Street Entertainment District' proposed for later this decadeSo by June-ish there will be:~ A bar/nightclub~ 3 restaurants (I hear that one of them will be a sushi place)~ A 24 hour newsstand (unheard of for DT that something will be open 24 hrs)~ A grocery (another much-needed commodity)~ A mini skatepark (bringing the 'urban' element to RR)They already hold concerts here and withing the next few months they will hold one with 15 bands  I can't wait to review this place once its fully developed  In the meantime I'm giving it 5 stars for the proposal.
I use to come here all the time it's my first time back in a year the bartenders have NO personality and rude they just want their tip and ignore the customers I will give it another year before I go back It's sad they hired these pricks.
I was looking for a good idea for breakfast in my South Scottsdale neighborhood and just could not pass by the 27 good reviews of US Egg in good conscience without relaying my very different experience - one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had I usually like US Egg but had never been to this location until about 6-8 weeks ago A friend and I were running around doing errands and decided to stop for a quick bite what turned out to be about 13 minutes before closing We asked if they were still serving the answer from the host was yes of course and were shown to our table I made a quick run to the ladies' room while my friend ordered coffee and got menus And it was when I returned to the table that things began their nose-dive  Evidently our waitress had dropped off the menus and told my friend that we needed to hurry and order and actually expressed annoyance that I was in the ladies room Hmm At this point I gave US Egg the benefit of the doubt People don't actually say things like that But when the waitress came to take our order she was clearly annoyed So much so I asked if it was too late to get a meal told her we'd asked at the door when we arrived She said we'd have to hurry but they were still open I chalked it up to her being tired at the end of her work day We ordered immediately and breakfast arrived quickly The food was a disaster: coffee was cold the eggs were not cooked the veggies were not edible the hollandaise was out of a can or other container and had been microwaved or something still retaining the shape of the container (read not warmed enough) Just thinking about it now makes me shudder Honestly I could not eat it I tried We were hungry While we "ate" someone came over to our area and mopped the floor with some very strong smelling cleaning solution OMG There was no one else sitting around us We did not get coffee refills The waitress left the building And we had to flag someone else down who was clearly annoyed to have to bring coffee and the bill She saw that we had not eaten and offered a container but we declined A good opportunity to point out the raw broccoli and jellied hollandaise and said we did not want to take it with us it was not a good meal at all and we'd wished that they had simply told us no they could not serve us at the door She shrugged  The host/manager sat at a table near the door reading one of the free newspapers from the rack near the door appearing to be killing time waiting to close unaware of what was happening We did not complain The problem was with multiple personnel including him No one - host two waitresses cook(s) and floor clean-up guy took any pride in their work or showed any sign of "welcoming" us into their establishment Instead of being so rude and wasting our time and thiers they should have politely asked us to come back another time when we came in the door That would have been fine  We could not wait to get out of there I left a minimal tip (I was not going to let them decide my response to their bad behavior) I paused at the door looking back at our table I was amazed to see that there were at least 3 other tables of people eating so we were certainly not the last lingering guests The manager never even looked up from his reading and we walked right by him On the way to the car I swore to myself that I'd find and write a letter to the *owner* but never did More wasted time We were just never going back Ugh This was one of the most "inhospitable" hospitality experiences I've ever had I fully expected the restaurant to be closed by now And instead I see positive reviews Bewildering.
Went here recently with a lady-friend  I've been dying to take her here and our vacation gave us the opportunityShe doesn't drink coffee and when she asked what the "barista" recommended that didn't have coffee in it he rudely said "Go to Starbucks down the street"Despite my natural instinct to choke him I quietly ordered a coffee as to not start my  vacation badlyMy lady and I went outside to have our drinks  The "barista" left his post and sat outside too with his friends  They went on to heckle and by heckle I mean shout loudly at the ladies entering the tanning salon a few suites over  They were shouting "CANCER" "SUN IS FREE STUPID" and such  Hey employee at Matador  They know they don't care  Shut up  I'm pretty sure that shouting at potential customers makes you the stupid oneOh yeah  The coffee was a shadow of what it was and the chai latte my girlfriend got was awfulNever coming to this place againMan I miss Mario and co.
Where do I start  The burgers - All  were over cookedThe fries - they were soggy  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the firstWarm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it  It came out after all the burgers and fries  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked  It wasn't edibleChocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the centerWe thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers so we were excited to eat there  We will never go back.
This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it  At that time they also had competent staff  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering just run like hell.
Ouch & GROSS  Expensive and Disgusting  "Cal-Ital" foodHow stupidHonestly I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish and it was absolutely tasteless  It tasted like wallpaper paste  It was surprisingly awful since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street which is very goodFor good carbonara go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano  I choose good food over decore anytime.
Okay I have not given any place a one star review in a while and looking at some of this restaurant's "friend"ly reviews I am one of the only few that has given this place a one star  Why Overall feeling  A big part of liking or loving a restaurant not just about the food or service  Its the atmosphere and how it makes you feel  Hereit seems out of place  This restaurant is pushing a concept and atmosphere onto downtown phoenix that seems to fit better in Scottsdale  Here in downtown we are a bit more down to earth we like to feel welcomed and comfortable when coming to a restaurantwe don't want to sit upright and nibble on a $5 Chicken wing  And yes it is is WingsingularWith that out of the waylets move onService:  Not ban but not good  The servers were not helping in describing the dishes  Especially for a asian fusion restaurant this is a mustAmbience:  The patio looked greatthe decor was kinda weirdI did not get the music nor the art that was displayed  It did not fit the conceptDrinks:  I didn't even ordernot interestingFood:  I had the Duck Confit  which I have to say one of the worst I have had  It was so oily and flavorlessSpring Roll- how can anyone over soak rice paper It was so soggy I took one bite and that was itLop Xeong Crepe- Again another soggy itemurgghTonkotsu Ramen- This was not done correctlythe broth is too richnot in a good wayDessert-Blueberry Mochi with Lychee sorbet-  Now this was great  The textures and sweetness good balanceAll in all I was really disappointed with this restaurant  I wish the chef/owner would have stuck to something more similar to his other successful concepts which are more in line with his skillsAsian fusion I don't think is his nichethere are many asian fusion restaurants that have better executionThe Mission is one of the best restaurants in Phoenixthat should have been a model when opening a new restaurantthat is what downtown phoenix needs.
If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses This is a miserable place serving miserable food with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the dayIf you can imagine it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun Got it.
Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South  Hope this info helps some of you  BTW don't you just love orangeheads  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned itYou really shouldn't have your picture posted pug I mean easy targetLets go west side yeppie.
I travel frequently Ive stayed at many 4-5 stars so i know what to expect when it comes to service This hotel lacks customer service professionalism organization and the ability to meet the paying customers needs For this I rate them a 1 star They completely screwed up my reservations (i had multiple rooms reserved) pretty funny they claimed they didnt have accurate billing set up yet charged my account fees The reservation desk and front desk deserve an F- minus all around Please save your time money and frustration and book elsewhere.
Where to start - how about the over hour wait for my appointment with no reason as to why and then when asked why and when I would get in - I was told just a few more minutes At this point I called my husband who had an appointment after mine and said come down I am giving you my appointment so we are not here all day So my 10 am appointment for a routine cleaning became his appointment for the same thing and he was called in at 11:20 - this in essence my appointment was almost an hour and a half late I am sitting there waiting for my husband thinking he is getting his x-rays and cleaning when I get a text from him saying only 15 min more and I get to see the dentist Silly me - I am thinking his x-rays and cleaning are done He finally comes out over an hour later (mind you it would only be 15 min to see the dentist) and tells me that he has to come back next week for the cleaning What He sat there for over an hour just to get x-ray's Then when told he'd see the dentist in 15 min it was over 45 min So my husband was in their chair for over two hours and all he had done was x-rays and about 20 min with the dentist trying to tell him he needed a crown replaced (that did not need replacing) and that he had two cavities that the dentist never did show him on the x-ray Mind you when he was at the dentist (his original before we moved to Arizona) everything was fine At this point neither of us are happy - I rescheduled my "cleaning" for the very first appointment on a Sat so we would not have to wait an hour and a half again for an appointment I was not happy at all with the service and asked for the office manager to call me Monday morning I was told no problem On Tues afternoon I called and was told oh she is not here today and has left for CA for a corporate meeting - never did tell me why she did not call me on Monday I then proceed to call the corporate officee to voice my concerns They tell me that they have had complaints because of the wait times and lack of communication with patients and she was not surprised She in turned called the Glendale AZ office and told them that they were to make sure that both my husband and I were in and out on time for our appointments and all that was to be done was a cleaning So - here we are - my husband has an appointment today (Sat) to do his cleaning He gets a message telling him that he has to come in early to do a "service-plan" and his cleaning would cost him $180 because they only do deep cleanings and his insurance does not pay for deep cleanings I call them back and ask to talk to the office manager (she left the mess) I explain that I am not happy we are not paying $180 and there will be no "service plan" - I get hung up because I am told that I am not talking nice Really - I call back - I tell the person on the phone that I want to speak to the office manager again - she tells me that the office manager wants me to come in and discuss this with her I tell the receptionist that I am sorry if I sound angry with you it is not your fault but you do not want me in your office right now as your patients probably do not want to hear what I have to sayImagine my surprise when the office manager gets on the phone and tells me that I just threatened her employee mumbles something and hangs up on me Also keep in mind not only did I tell them but corporate told them that they needed to call me not my husband as he is very hard to reach and I can get ahold of him and have him call them if necessary - and they keep calling him not me and he cannot return calls or answer his phone while he is working In addition - their reception area is awful dirty (my husband likens it to a free clinic in a third world country) and not very invitingBelieve me when I say that corporate is getting a call first thing Monday which will probably do no good and I am posting this everywhere I can - it joins the other 30+ or so bad reviews that I have read about Western Dental Do not risk your teeth money or health from what I read and go to Western Dental.
I ordered today a delivery order and was told it would be about 45 minutesAn hour and a half later I called back to check on the order and was informed "the guy is on his way" and then was hung up on I called back and asked what the delay was and had the food been driving around for the past hour or what's going on  I was told "look u want the food or not I just don't care I will cancel the order if you want" I DO CAREI asked to speak with owner or manager and was told "look nobody cares so take it or leave it"RUDE and RUDENOT Recommended.
Gag  This place is no good  The worst sushi I have ever had  Honestly We ordered a yellow roll and the fish was so old I was gagging and couldn't even swallow  We told the sushi chef and they didn't do anything  They said they would take $1 off  Boo for bad fish and boo for bad service.
Really if I could I would give this place zero stars because it is a disgrace If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St(http://wwwsonoraveterinaryspecialistscom/) It's also 24/7 but unlike VCA PVEAH it is a truly valuable legitimate facility and it''s staffed by engaged committed deeply caring and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel At SVS you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justifiedVCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way VCA is in fact the WORST of corporate animal service providers The space is small cheap cramped and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress All they want is your money They do NOTHING for the $9975 they charge for an "emergency exam" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication)  Furthermore they tack on bogus surcharges ($525 for a "biohazard waste fee") that are irrelevant to the "service" provided and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet anyoneConversely our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency) and the cost was ultimately significantly lessVCA is a money-grubbing depressing sham.
Never written a review on yelp and this is my first Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at an auto establishment I go to the Fletchers off Lake Pleasant and Happy valley frequently This is the first time I've gone to this Fletchers I cannot express to you strongly enough to stay as far away it from this place as you can Rude inconsiderate and unprofessional.
I was somewhat excited when the store says "Made famous in Venice Beach" I was hoping for a Nathan's kind of hot dog but I was dead wrong I know that airport food isn't usually good but this place's just horrible I got their Hot Italian sausage ($6) - Sausage some veggies with bell peppers First off it's way over priced and the sausage's pretty small Second the sausage doesn't even taste all that and it's not grilled right the outer part isn't even crispy Lastly I was still mad hungry Luckily their fries ($275) weren't bad The seasoning isn't bad however it's mad greasy The oil literally soaked through to the table I wouldn't go back here again.
My overall review for this location of Brueggers is 1-star But I must say when you ACTUALLY get what you ordered the food is quite good I prefer Brueggers over Einstein's any day The bagels are softer and I enjoy their flavors better But one can only describe a trip to the Brueggers at 24th and Camelback as either a trip to the Twilight Zone an episode of Candid Camera or a stint on Punk'd (or a combination of all of the above) The employees are friendly enough and it seems to be locally owned and operated but the employees are slow inept and downright stuipd I hate to call anyone stupid but there really is no other explanation You must repeat even the simplest of orders at least three-four times and only order one item or sandwich at a time No matter what type of bagel you ask for they grab a different one and you have to nicely inform them once again of the kind you wanted If you ask for no cheese on the sandwich they put it on any way Ask for bacon You get sausage It's really that badOne trip I ordered two sandwiches Knowing their level of service I ordered SLOWLY and asked for one sandwich at a time The employee asked me three times what type of bagel four times if I wanted it toasted and still got it wrong I seriously felt I was on MTV's Boiling PointsMy last three visits I brought the food home only to find the order was wrongToday I ordered two bagel sandwiches One was correct the other was totally wrong after reminding the employee three times of what I wanted (and after stopping him from grabbing the wrong bagel)I live nearby its a convenient location and the food is good The service SUCKSI typically go on the weekends but I have friends that work in the building and they have had similar experiences during the week and have stopped goingYou have to experience this for yourself Words seriously can't describe.
I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle  DUH - water  Odd- never had that happen before   I was seated right away but it took 10-15 minutes for the person to take the order  Food came out very quickly  Chicken breast was lukewarm tough and not very tasty  KFC has better chicken for less money  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion  Skip this place.
As with any landlord read the fine print Make sure you document and understand what fees they can charge you at their sole discretion If you dispute what they charge they will not listen and simply submit it to a debt collection agency Photograph and document everything upon move in They make considerable money soaking tenants upon move out I personally would find a more scrupulous landlord.
This place is overpriced and has mediocre food We asked for separate checks when we entered and after we ate they told us we couldn't have separate checks Itried to talk to the manager but he just walked away This used to be a great place but when they went to full service  raised prices and took some of their best items off the menu it became just another overpriced restaurant that couldn't care less about customer service.
After a day full of meetings I gathered a friend and we headed out to eat some Mexican I had visions of chips/salsa and margaritas We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed Egads Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street And thus begins the saga "Hi are you here for happy hour" We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway At least we got a booth Lucky us huh Joe "lots of product in his hair" brought us menus and took our drink orders He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait with the stipulation "on the rocks with salt" My drink and my friend's water arrived and we ordered The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time Really Joe product Chips with the meal FYI chips and salsa here aren't complimentary you have to order and pay for them It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo My friend brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table Now my friend is getting annoyed It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants so we're not sure where they are coming from but they don't stop Friend mentions it a second time and then again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge Our bill comes we pay and my friend asks for the manager Hell he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up thus we'll call him Bed Head Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house Really That's your solution He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area Egads no thanks we just wanted to leave We weren't after free food but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated A free drink Heymaybe one of those $6000 margaritas would have made everything alright As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it lol) with beans and rice and they were dry I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them My friend had a steak and avocado salad He said it was ok This is a never return place for meAnd a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks and before the mealReflecting back we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevantThe margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.
walked in got seated the table was still dirty/oily/sticky Smelled like a mixture of cleaning products and old fish My daughter was getting ill due to the smell so we left Didnt order and never will We were really looking forward to a good bowl of pho It was disappointing.
Wish there was a 0 star option My mother in law got a manicure and gel polishthe tech that did her nails left gel polish on her skin and didn't try to take it off when she mentioned it to him I got a pedicure and it was not relaxing at all My nails weren't filed evenly and there was polish all over my skin When the tech was done painting my nails she immediately put my sandals on and told me to go pay I asked her if they were dry enough and she said "probably not" I wish I would have saved myself the $25 and gone somewhere else.
I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole My car was broken into here in broad daylight There's always unsavory characters lolling about and that's just the people that work there They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them As for the people that shop here if you stand too close you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot Every time I come here without fail there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter trying to convince them they just "lost" their written prescription for Vicodin or their Percocets got "stolen" all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain So you're asking now why I even come here and I don't blame you I work long hours and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode Sometimes a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility What can I do except clutch my bag extra close scared-old-lady style and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home.
The staff sucks and the food is overrated  Too bad because it is a cool place  Fire everyone and start over.
Although i love Ponchos and the food is awesome i hate the take out girls They mess up every time we get take out They have no respect for customers and employees I don't feel comfortable calling and complaining every time and i mean EVERY TIME they forget something in my bag or mess the whole order up I live in laveen and by time i get home I'm not going back for a mistake that happens way too often Example: I go yesterday to get our evening dinner Made it simple but we did order a lot I paid with my credit card Well i checked my bag before i left the window Strike 1: half pint of chili i ordered wasn't in there but they insisted it was Oops try again Strike 2:  I ask for my receipt not credit card receipt but the food receipt showing what i ordered Response to that was well ummmmmmm when you use your credit card the only receipt you get is the transaction one you sign My response is no that's wrong i want my food receipt She refused Strike 3: when she closed the window on my face WWJD Walk away i guess I had my hands full my two kids with me and I was very tired I'm over it Take out window will not see me for a while I hope Ponchos management looks into a customer service class for these ladies because these ladies acting like that now at such a young age will find out real soon when life hits them as adults that they need to be CLASSY.
Ate here due to great reviews So so so disappointed Shrimp taco was gross and was made with uncooked tiny salad shrimp with cabbage thrown on top Chips & corn tortilla uses for a shredded beef taco were stale Cheese enchilada and southwest burrito were okay.
This location sucks balls One of the guys walked off in the middle of taking my order because I didn't instantly respond with what drink I wanted for my combo I literally glanced up for a second to see what they had and apparently that inconvenienced him He handed the order slip to another guy standing next to him and said "Here you finish this order" and walked off The guy taking over wasn't a doll either He took my cash gave me my change and closed the screen door on me without any "thank you" or anything On to the food Now I never really like Pete's to begin with but I'll go because my BF loves it I think mainly because he grew up eating Pete's so it has become somewhat a childhood nostalgia I don't like their fish at all but I find their shrimps decent so that's what I usually get The shrimps I got here were over battered and overcooked though I had to tear off all the edges on them because they were way too hard to chew Bad food and bad service I will never come here again Go to the Mesa one or according to my BF the "real deal Pete's" on Central in S Phx.
Wouldn't give them 1 star DONT use your debit card here Gave son a debit mastercard gift card He use it there and they took all the money that was left on the card He spent $1000 and they took $7600 from the gift card We both called Valero and spoke to the manager She doesn't know how to do her job Call the debit card will take 2 weeks Doesn't help my son when in need of money This is why my husband and I never use or have a debit card By the way son has the receipt My family always stop in for gas drinks smokes snacks etc but after this we will never go there again NEVER.
Horrible experience Bridal make-up run-thru was not cleanly Artist Tracy did the application in 15 mins looked noticeably  uneven  They tried to reschedule the up-do run-thru for another day after having the appointment a month in advance Unacceptable treatment with forced opinions onto the bride Blatant attempt at promoting other services at the spa after it was made clear they weren't desired Nail technician who did shellac pedicure was the only positive she did a wonderful job  We were forced to pay for the horrible make-up application which was a poor decision reflective of the management.
the folks in student financial aid  are the reason I don't attend this school they are clueless dishonest and dare I say hateful   If you have tons of money and need no advice then go here   If you ever  ever need help with paying for school then lol do as I was told "scale back your lifestyle"   even the advisors know how horrible they are yet no one does a thingbefore leaving I went on Facebook to get info from other students about fin aid guess what they deleted it   LOL ummmmm ok.
This is first time I try to use their  service  Base on the review I think they should be good  We call for service for my water heater  They are way overcharged  I frankly told them that I have to compare the service  They charged me 6000 knowing they will not get the job  Pretty sneaky company   60 dollars just to tell me how much it cost me to get the installation done  Pretty easy money huh  I bet they don't make business by doing good job but piling up the profit by going out to make 6000 for half hour  Take my advise  avoid them  I found a good plumber after all and I believe you will.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEMy first visit to this place was today I decided to go with a friend and grab some tacos in the drive-thru I ordered 2 chicken tacos and asked for a little sour cream and guacamole on each one With a soda my total came to $1049 I asked why it was so expensive They told me they had to charge me for the sour cream and guacamole I told them I wouldn't mind paying a little extra but I didn't need an entire side order of each I just wanted a little on each taco I was okay with them charging my a little extra for this but not THAT much extra The lady at the drive thru asked us to pull forward to try and resolve my request As we pulled to the pick-up window the manager poked his head out I told him what I ordered and asked him why it was so expensive I told him I'd be willing to pay a dollar or so extra for the guac and sour cream but I thought it was outlandish to pay that much extra for two tacos His argument was that I would get more for my money I told him I wouldn't eat all that extra sour cream and guacamole and that it would be a waste I told him that I felt like I was wasting my time and that it seemed ridiculous to pay that much for two tacos with a little guac and sour cream His response "Yes I agree with you that this seems like a waste of time" REALLY I couldn't believe I was getting such bad customer service and such an attitude from a manager My friend and I were so put off that we drove away with no food and paying nothing The owner of this place should be ashamed that they hired such a terrible managerMy first impression of this place was horrible NICKELING AND DIMING your customers is NOT the way to keep a customer base and a consistent clientele I will NEVER go back They just lost a customer and because I'm well-connected in the valley they've probably lost all my friends as customers as wellNot a good way stay in business in this economy I'm afraid.
This garish dated murky old place was an absolute ripoff Was looking for a relaxing day and went in fofr a much-overpriced facial Ended up with a treatment you could not PAY me to do I have lost an entire pair of contact lenses from this cuckoo rubbing "exfoliant" and two other creams into my eyes had hair ripped out as she gave a "scalp massage" with plastic gloves on had "lip treatment" jammed into my teeth and then I could not get the woman to leave the room to allow me to dress having had to end the treatment early to avoid the next - and much-dreaded - "eye treatment" (She was busy trying to sell me the products) Additionally the "amenities" are a gym (which I have a membership elsewhere and nicer) a sauna and a dirty whirlpool I wouldn't soak my feet in let alone my body The bathroom stalls have water damage and it's a good thing they provide flipflops because I wouldn't step foot in the showers without them When I mentioned the facial experience (or lack thereof) to the woman at the desk on the way out she offered me a coupon dor "half off" another treatment - which means it would still be only REALLY overpriced Avoid this place Even one of the cheapie chain massage/facial places exceeds this resort - and would be reasonably priced.
Quick summaryburned funnel cake dry turkey leg soggy hot dogs that were literally grey old watery lemonade passed off as a lemon shake up overpriced items from Ecuador and Mexico for sale no desirable rides basically a complete waste of time and money  Can you make memories  Surebut a better classification would be regrets.
I was in AZ for a family trip so I searched on Yelp for a good Thai restaurant to eat  Chanpen Thai Cuisine in the result with 45 stars  So I can't here on 08/28/13 to try the food out  It is a small house/building Inside it is soooo small & only have a couple of small tables We orded 3 dishes the drunken noodle the pai thai and the beef salad The waiter aka 1 man does all he's the cashier the bust boy the order man Omg it take forever for him to come to our table & take the order the next worst part is the food take about 40minutes to come Omg & the worst part is the food is so horrible the noodle in the pai & the drunken noodle was all mushy/over cooked The meat in all the dishes are not fresh & tasted weird The beef salad was sooo salty It's very pricey & it is the worst Thai food I have ever eat Omg what a wasted of money & timeI will never never stop by here ever again when I'm in the area They need to improve the food or shame on them for calling those horrible dishes Thai food.
"Uhm we don't give out change here" yes that's what I was told at the to-go register when I parked a few feet from the door at a metered parking spot by the restaurant and merely asked to break a dollar so our party could eat here  They don't give change  They don't have a dedicated lot - they have metered parking right outside their doors  Grrrrreat policy Mellow MushroomFood is on a par with the other MM in town  Service varies depending on the server many of which have attitudes  Draft list is long but much of it isn't of much interest to anyone who's been into craft beer for awhile  Good location on Mill  Looks like that's why they'll stay in business and for no other reason.
Had my first and last dining experience at Liberty MarketI agree with another comment I read below cafeteria-style service should include cafeteria-style prices  The food was just ok and I did not appreciate paying lots of cash for what I had for lunch  (A very small salad with thinly sliced deli turkey on top)I also see lots of comments about their "awesome" bathroom  Really  Who cares about the bathroomSuggestion:  Go to Joe's BBQ directly across the street or if it's breakfast you are in downtown Gilbert for go next door to The Farmhouse  Hands Down Blows Liberty Market away.
Wont be coming back Taking some movies back to blockbuster we decided to stop by here for pizza This is a delivery/take out only location so we ordered for takeout I've been doing low-carb diet so I ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad and a pizza for the kids It came up to nearly $40 for take-out for a large pizza and a salad We get the food home and the salad looks like a dinner side salad Mainly iceberg lettuce with a couple tomatoes and a few thick strips of cheddar cheese on top My wife goes back to tell them we ordered a buffalo chicken salad and they send her back home with a few chicken strips No buffalo sauce in sight Not spicy If I wanted to eat iceberg lettuce with some microwave chicken strips I would have done that at home for about $2 instead of paying nearly $13 While waiting for my wife to get back I ate a few slices of the pizza despite my low-carb diet and got indigestion before even finishing threw up by bed time and spent the next day feeling ill at work My daughter and son who ate the pizza are also sick today Will not be going back that's for sure.
We were in route from Phoenix to Tuscon and needed dinner I looked up a few places online and Eva's seemed like a reasonable optionThis restaurant has EVERYTHING it needs to be successful:* A cool atmosphere-- check* a great menu--check* Good drink specials--check checkDespite all of this this was hands down the WORST Mexican dinner I have ever had in my entire life (I eat a ton of Mexican food)First of all the service is terrible  Our waitress did not know what beer was on tap did not know the drink specials or happy hour dinner apps and didn't give us appropriate drink refillsThe food takes the cake for being just plain awful  I ordered tortilla soup and one of the happy hour nachos my husband ordered a combo meal and my cousin ordered a steak rice bowl  After one bite of my soup I was completely done (tasted like it was burnt) my husband and cousin could stomach a little more than me but still felt like the food was sub par at best  I mentioned to the server that I was disappointed with my soup and all she could offer was to take it back to the kitchen (no replacement option or comp ticket) Bottom line: Would I ever eat here again  Nope  Never.
This place was terrible The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet I figured they had just mopped boy was I wrong As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye I looked up and the duct work was leaking There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me Now about the food First it was way over priced Each item is sold separately I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over A cocktail is on average $8 I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal I will never go here again Moral of the story overpriced gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room.
Lunch went downhill today  we were hungry and decided to stop at Red Robin  To begin with I had to ask the server to wipe off the table  The place had just opened for lunch and all the tables looked like they had been hastily wiped down from the night before and put out to the pasture to dry  Even the menus were sticky  Gross  Burgers were just "OK"  Lots of sloppy sauce  Nothing to write home about Meh  I ate the meat and left the bun  $22 for two burgers  We won't be back  PS- This place needs a good cleaning.
The best part of the meal was our server she was friendly and attentive  The food was pathetic  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese about the size of a quarter on each   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and nakedSat near the window big mistake it was so hot.
I'm utterly terrified of this store I opt to drive a few miles to Frys instead.
Never used the service but I was just driving near this dude and he drives like an asshole Who knows maybe he was in a hurry to pick someone up but that doesn't give him an excuse to weave in between traffic and then ride someone's bumper when he can't get around them I definitely wouldn't use this company even if someone paid me.
I had never been to this store's location in Scottsdale before Saturday I have frequented the Biltmore location (and I'm a HUGE fan of their store & clothes) However I will NEVER go back to the Bogota location because of the service/staff The only people in the store who were getting good service or help were the snotty sales girl's friends Not only were they unhelpful but the sales girl actually insulted me to my face ("YOU're a size 2" - YES actually I am)I walked out and went to the Biltmore location to spend several hundred dollars I am a big supporter of luluemon's products and storebut avoid the Bogota location if you want any service or a good selection.
Charged well over 280 dollars for "paint" at the end of my residency When charge was contested a refund was provided--to the credit of the managementAlso Valet Trash continued to tick me off until the end of my residency especially when a friend showed me the following he had googled from the Valet Trash Web site: "Camden's trash-to-cash successCamden is more than happy for the opportunityto offer its residents the service in anever-expanding number of markets and overthe past year has seen the program produceancillary income far beyond what the apartmentREIT expected in September 2007 AValet Waste customer for the past 10 yearsbeginning with its Florida portfolio by fall oflast year the program was serving 26500 residentsat 69 Camden properties The companysaw net income/profit of $40000 from thetrash pick-up amenity in August 2007 whenCamden execs expected Valet Waste wouldbegin picking up the trash five nights a weekat an additional 6089 units in another 20communities by Q4 2007 and that the programwould contribute $2 million annuallyin net profits by 2009A year later in September 2008 Camdenreported a $740000 profit from the trashpick-up program for the second quarterwhich averages out to nearly $247000 amonth with more than 35000 units at 95of the REIT's 182 communities participatingand expectations for annual net profit ofbetween $4 million and $5 million by 2009more than twice that expected a year earlierfor the same target".
This is the worst food ever  White trash people you now have another gathering spot besides the greyhound bus terminals Why eat here please tell me.
Live bug in sauceI saw a bug crawling in Green sauce which I already put it in my food  When I reported it to waiter there she just disappeared with the sauce No one came to my table for 10 minutes and  I had to call waiter to replace my food with bug infected food after 10 minutesWorst experience ever.
Loud  Musters are horrid Danny hall the manager a dick Don't go Over rated Loud inside Wet outside.
Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.
AMC is now a China owned company and unfortunately I would prefer to support something USA owned or local   I switched Harkins which is Arizona owned  I will give up a recliner any day to support locally owned businesses Peace out AMC.
I went to this restaurant yesterday and paid two meals with drinks When I arrived at the salad bar I was dismayed to find pasta smeared on the serving tray I dug through the whole pile and didn't find a single clean one I then looked at the plates and began to pick them up in every stack of plates and they were ALL greasy had food on them and smudges of black oil of some kind on them My hands were greasy just picking them upI called for the manager and demanded my money back immediately and requested that she have all the plates and trays washed The help and manager started picking through looking for an occasional clean-ish plate When I saw this happening I told the manager that I would call the health department if she didn't remove all the dishes immediatelyMy concern though is that all the food dishes may have been contaminated in the same manner If you got sick there let me know.
I agree with others who have said about the broth being too oily and fatty Noodles were fine but I couldn't even finish half the bowl before I started getting grossed out and had to eat from my husband's bbq pork sandwhich instead which was actually pretty decent I'm a big carnivore but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies too much meat and pretty tasteless Service was HORRIBLE You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served Soda was served straight from the can - no glass not even a straw Definitely not worth the 12 mile drive.
Alright it hurts me to do this but after today Poncho's is dead to me I was a faithful customer for years as I grew up in the Laveen area I returned today excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic Bleh It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby Don't get me wrong I love babies but every reasonable person has limits Also our waitress was awful I'm not usually too picky but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was She was morose made no effort to engage and everything we wanted we had to chase her down for And we arriveat the food The zucchini appetizer is off the menu big disappointment My beef tamale was awful I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees The salsa is still good but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks Sorry Poncho's You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit.
Um Okay  That pretty much sums up my experience with Dave and Busters  I would not recommend this place unless you are into playing arcade games    I went with some coworkers and their spouses  We chose D&B because we thought it would a fun way to bond as a team  We started off with dinner The menu looked promising for American style food and then it came out  Nothing was tasty not even the French fries who screws up French fries  Okay so we didn't go there for the food we went there for the games and such  We were told that it was an adult atmosphere and by adults  I can only assume they meant over  13  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch.
Nasty company whose founders should be fined for harassment   Made dozens of automated calls to my new cell phone looking for a man I don't know yet when you press the number to indicate they have the wrong person the system hangs up on you and proceeds to call you every day anyway  When I finally did get in touch with a rep he wouldn't give me the full name of the company what business the company was in the purpose it was calling me or anyone I could contact to get this info  After that he hung up on me  Law states debt collection agencies must identify themselves and the purpose of their company when contacting (possible) debtors and anyone hiring this company should know they are entering a contract with someone who's standard operating procedures are against the law.
I have worked in the restaurant industry for years now and normally don't post about restaurants I can be very understanding but this place is such a disappointment  I had to say something First of all I don't know how you can mess up fried tofu (seriously) they chopped up four large pieces of tofu flash fried them without any seasoning and charged $9 for them When we tried them they were greasy on the outside and very raw inside Next we got the wings that looked great in the picture but tasted terrible They were rubbery soggy and super fatty My boyfriend and I could not even finish a few because they made our stomach sick Again $9 The rest of the dishes and the sushi were so mediocre and blah I just cant believe we wasted our moneyI have lived downtown for 6 years and if this place doesn't change something very soon it will not last a summer in this town We called to complain about this terrible meal but haven't heard back from anyone I hope we do but I doubt it.
Food was ok service sucked.
I called ahead and made a 3:30 appointment for a haircut so I wouldn't have to wait I arrived on time and told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Kelli Rather than tell Kelli I was there waiting this arrogant woman ignored me and continued to talk on the phone for maybe 10 minutes before I got angry and left No way would I go back to this business They are obviously unable to hire front-desk employees with a minimum level of competence.
Wish I had seen prior reviews about microwaving the food would never of gone  Ordered Bean & Cheese Burrito $425 (not worth the price smaller than average) Cheese Enchilada $250 3 Rolled tacos & gauc $525 (taquitos) Rice and beans $225 ea $19 total  The hot sauce was watered down no flavor but hot  Everything was in warming bins the food tasted as it been there for a while Should of taken the clue when we went in around 6pm and there were no customers  Would not go back Ever.
Went to the location on 32nd and Cactus The ribs are very good and house cole slaw is good HOWEVER we ordered for 2 and received two very tiny containers of sauce and one very small container of cole slaw Way over priced They need to stop being so stingy with there side orders and sauce.
Ordering food for a friend  I would never eat at Panda  Unflavorful and greasy  I am writing more about the service  Yes I guess it was food court after all but that still does not make it right to have bad customer service  The cashier reached over the counter to grab this small container to see what was in it  I told her orange chicken and then she threw it back in my bag and it was tipped over  Careless.
This is by far the worst towing company in arizona In the process of towing my car onto their flatbed they twisted my chassis and completely shattered my back window The fat a** kid who towed my car apparently didn't know what he was doing and didnt notice what he had done I've submitted a claim the day they towed my vehicle and was told someone would get back to me within 7-10 business days Two weeks passed and no call i tried calling their corporate office left several messages and still no response Ive tried talking to their hr department and all they told me was i have to talk to claims This company is so shady and so unprofessional with no respect for personal property.
Mixed reviews- Yes the pizza is pretty good But been there once and had the nacho's cost me almost $20 bucks And yes you guessed it the plate of nacho's with 15 chips and each chip going around plate and each nacho had typical stuff a little beans sum cheese sum lettuce sour cream But you know those nacho platesyou've seen it not a pile of chips just individual chip next to each other all the way around outside of plate It was like $19 bucks and drank water I was like come on I can go too fili b's and get with carne asada on my nacho's and big pile of em for $5 bucks Food is good ie pizza but expensive  For what you get.
Two months later and I'm still waiting for the car stereo case that came with the radio they installed plus I spoke with Scott on 3-16-13 and he said he would look into it Spoke to Kenneth yesterday and he had the negative attitude to tell me that a detachable stereo does not come with a case That's like saying a the right shoe does not come without the left shoe  A company says alot about the people they employ and while Scott is VERY good and knowledgeable there are some individuals who need more training and customer service at this location Its okay Sterling I just sent Allstate a message they will contact you and  to fix he over spray The last comment  and FACT is if you would have done the job right the first time you would not have a bad business review I will update my experience whenever my truck gets fixed Next month  next yearyou tell me Meanwhile I"ll send corporate a message  to follow up.
Never again will I come here There was absolutely no courtesy to the customer from the second I walked through the door They asked me if I was there for eyebrows Instead of asking "what can we do for you" their followup was: you want a full setThey did not seem willing to do even the most simple design on real nails unless I wanted acrylics I have seen plenty of people get simple designs on their actual nails with the final result looking amazing so I'm not sure what their deal wasNot to mention this was the most painful manicure ever She hurt me when fixing my cuticles Their nail buffer felt more like a nail file and she continuously caught my skin at the base of the nailI have been to low-budget places that still have good manner and are personable with their customer even with language barriersand I got absolutely ZERO satisfaction from this place I wish I could erase this from my day off and start my morning over Aren't you supposed to leave salons feeling a little pampered.
I would not use this company again  Do they clean well YES  But make sure you get your estimate in writing  I was quoted a price then charged 3 times more than quoted  I spoke with the owner to find out what was going on and he told me I was never quoted what I said I washe was calling me a liar  After a 5 minute conversation he would not come to any agreement  This is a dishonest company  There are so many other businesses you could usedont use this one.
I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est Well to cut this short I am a spicy fave type of guy I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken  Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing this est upset me and I threw it what they tried to feed me in the trash THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN Even if they dared try to redeem what happened.
***** Important Note *****After posting this review I receive perhaps the nicest note from an owner one could possibly receive (even offering his phone number) CLEARLY the owner takes GREAT care and concern  I am completely beside myself and I WILL be going back  What a bummer  Honestly this was BY FAR the worst breakfast experience I've EVER had1)  they had the front door propped open letting the diesel fuel and burning rubber smells waff about the place (from the light rail construction immediately outside the door)2   the IKEA coffee table (I know 'cause I bought mine there) I was eating off of was wobbly spilling my coffee all over the place3)  my coffee sucked4)  and my food really sucked -- I had the "Switch [eggs] Benedict" the hollandaise sauce sucked and the egg was over cooked and coldThat said the place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL they played trendy electronica in the background supplied free Wi-Fi and served liquor****************Okay second experience  I go back a second time to play on my MacBook and have a few drinks on the patio on a wonderfully great day  All is good until out of nowhere the waiter drops by my bill   Am I being shuttered out  Is his shift over  If so no biggie I've worked in a bar and am more than willing to tip out but I'd still like to stay and please tell me if that's that case  Grrrrr  Well at least the brunette waitress (not mine) is cute LOL*************.
Sorry Cornish  You have a good thing going it seems but need some polishing/cleaning  The place was doing a really brisk carryout business while we were there  Very friendly and eclectic staff  Good beer selection tooThe pasties were tasty but the temperature of the filling when reheated was not consistent - some hot spots some cool spots  I worry that this could be a recipe for food illnessThe star killer came just as we were getting ready to leave  A small roach came crawling out onto the bar in front of us  GGGAAAAHHHHDDDD.
Overrated Overpriced Underwhelming The cashiers are nice and friendly but that's as good as this place gets Their sandwiches are pathetic They are also not worth what you pay for I recommend going to a better place for your foodI'm going to use my "never again" card for this one.
I agree with the other reviews - but for different reasons   The management company (LPC / Lincoln Properties) "big corporation" approach trickles down and causes onsite management to behave like detached dronesTradition at Kierland is as beautiful as it looks     But it's not worth it  Be very afraid:  Being  "managed" by a huge property company means that the on-site management can do or say as they please (or do nothing) and hide behind "the company" since there is no one you can get ahold of in the event of a problem or dispute   The legal practices are questionable - like not showing you the entire lease until the day you move in - then you are surprised with some incredible terms:  Sure you don't have to sign - but this is on the day you have abandoned your old place and arrive with a moving truck wanting the keys     Also - don't be fooled by the seemingly incredible discounts (if you sign a 13 or 24 month lease) - they are indeed too good to be true - and you will indeed regret being fooled   I assume they can only get away with these practices due to the economy perhaps with so many people trying to rent instead of own - but this is only grasping for a reason that the company and management behave so badly   Be aware of any company that seems to have as many lawyers than maintenance staff  (they lawyers respond faster than maintenance)   Run - don't walk - away  there are lots of other places  (just read the fine print to make sure they are not managed by Lincoln Properties/LPC or one of their affiliates).
Bah  Below is my outdated review  I hate Danny's Do not come here  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair  They were like uh do you know part of your car is missing  my friend also had a bad experience  Over $200 for a crappy detail job  Don't botherWhat to say about Danny's    It's a full service joint  You can have your car washed oil changed tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes.
Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food I would like to know WHAT they are ordering Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least chicken was black and gross and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese Never been back.
My husband and I walked by last night and saw a letter on the door another Mill Avenue establishment bites the dust That didn't take long.
This place has the absolute worse cookies I have ever eaten and they are small cookies at $3 each  Don't get the raspberry one as it tastes like you are eating a hibiscus flower Yuck  I was sick all day after eating 1 bite The place is extremely pricey especially for lunch A very sad little restaurant that one should avoid.
VERY disappointed in this place The hostess and staff made it very obvious that only "regulars" were welcome After putting our name in we waited 45 minutes to be seated all the while watching all the regulars who came in after us be seated immediately After we were seated and ordered we waited about 30 minutes for our food My friends finally receive their food and my boyfriend and I were informed that our food was mysteriously given away to another table and we would need to wait another 30 minutes while they made us new food We nicely declined and left You couldn't pay me enough money to ever return to this place.
Was so hungry came across this place while walking to the mall The wonton soup was hideous  The broth was decent but the wonton another story The wonton wrap was way too thick very overwhelming and the stuffing had no flavorHot Spicy Szechuan Lobster: for it being $22 it tasted like crap too much badder can't even taste the lobster Sizzling Black Pepper Beef: presentation was nice however the beef was super dry It actually tasted like old meat I even think Panda Express meat taste better and it's 1/3 of that price.
2bmod was one of the stores I visited on my journey to find the perfect sofa The place is a bit difficult to find so be prepared to get lost a few times When I got there I had my mind set on a particular sofa The gentleman working there showed me a few swatches and then suddenly went in the back to take a phone call--and never came back Two other people came in and we all waited After about 15 minutes they finally left and so did I I still love their furniture but I won't be buying it anytime soon It's too bad their customer service was off that day.
I LOVE the concept  It's close by  The owner is a nice guy  But there's a huge problem here as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland fatty greasy and not the least bit appetizing  The fries are OK helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard  But they're nothing to write home about  Everything else is all about the gimmick beer booze broads cigarettes  The burgers are EXPENSIVE  Sorry but I just can't come back  If the burgers were even half-decent I think this place would be a huge success  But they're not and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be.
Unless you like to live in a roach infested apartment complex steer freaking clear of this placeI don't care how helpful the staff isI don't care how beautiful the pools areI don't care that they have free wifi for all their tenantsI do however really care if I have to live with roaches  This place was my living nightmare  I dealt with it for about 4 months and then finally the problem was resolved  I think I was down at the office about 1 a week to complain and set request spraying  The problem probably wasn't the management as much as it was the college kids with the wall of empty beer boxes separating their living room into two such rooms But still  It makes me frustrated to even think about itI will say this about the staff though They tried and tried for four straight months to correct the problem and they posted all kinds of notices to inspect our apartments AND they even evicted a tenant or two  So in all fairness they really did trySo what should you do now  Buy a house  Thank goodness I have control of what happens in these walls :).

I was so grossed out eating here The entire place was dirty They're doing some remodeling but no excuse The drink area was gross most of the tables were dirty the cashier obviously hates her job I very rarely write a bad review but I wanted someone else to be warned before they come to this restaurant They need someone from corporate to come evaluate it and clean it up Even the bathroom was worse than a ghetto gas station I will not be returning to this location.
This government office gets an F for being handicap accessible The parking does not provide enough van spaces Several able-bodied people were parking in the available spots with no placard The ramp was too steep and the door had no way to open automatically Still waiting in the initial check-in line so perhaps the verdict on the rest of their services will be different.
THERE WAS A HAIR THERE WAS A HAIR IN THE KOREAN PANCAKEWe found it during "Leftovers for Breakfast" I am crushed.
Don't waste your money or time Had worst experience here My order was wrong twice after waiting almost a half hour for two tacos Then when letting manager know he gave me attitude I don't pay to have someone insult my intelligence and doubt anyone else would I suggest going to Taco Bell.
First of all I saw this resturaurant on diners drive ins and dives I thought I'd give it a try I ordered the hard shell carne Asada tacos they were awful They tasted like rubber just very bland I think the meat might have been over cooked Needless to say I will not be returning.
We had guests visiting from California so we decided to take them out to BJ's for dessert for their famous pizookie What a horrible idea Each one of us had it and each one of us got sick I mean sick like vomiting and diarrhea Will never go back there again.
Have you ever had a florist call the person whom you've ordered flowers for to see if she was homeI love getting flowers  Especially when I am not told that I am getting them  Having the doorbell ring and instead of a salesman or a Jehovah witness there is a delivery driver with a beautiful bouquet of flowers makes me very happyApparently I am getting flowers today for my birthday  How do I know this  Because A Bloom Of Inspiration Florist called me at 2:15 pm to find out what my daily schedule is like and what time I will be leaving the address that was given by the person who lovingly ordered the flowers to be delivered to me  "Umm I am a stay at home mom  I will be here all day but thanks for ruining the surprise"  On a side note:  There was a time frame of 10am-6pm given when the flowers were ordered  So at 5 pm when the flowers still haven't been delivered  I call and the owner gives me a hard time because they are 20 miles away and delivery was inconvenient  The flowers were ordered from 1-800-Flowers  It was 1-800-Flowers who contracted thru this florist to deliver flowers to an address 20 miles away  I have no idea why they felt the need to address this issue with their customer  This should have been taken up with the company they're contracted with  BTW: This florists website says "Our delivery areas are GILBERT CHANDLER SUN LAKES MESA TEMPE SCOTTSDALE QUEEN CREEK" I live in south Scottsdale on the southeast border of Tempe and Mesa  It is after 6:00 pm and the flowers still have not been delivered  The hours of this florist listed on yelp is Mon-Fri til 6pm  So at this point I have no idea if my flowers will even be delivered today  Bottom line:  This florist is unprofessional ruined the surprise delivered very late in the day (or maybe not at all) complained to their customers and didn't provide the service as agreed upon____________________________________________________________Update:  The flowers were delivered at 6:25pm and I was told by the driver/apparent owner (again) how inconvenient the delivery was and how she had to close the store and drive the 20 miles to deliver  The flowers are cute but are not nearly as nice as the picture on 1-800-flowers describes them  I included both pictures above  My family member who ordered the flowers was very disappointed and will never use 1-800-flowers again  Although 1-800-flowers appologized for the issues that we had they were unwilling and unable to take responsibility for their contracted florists mistakes  My family member learned her lesson  If you want to order flowers for someone you love yelp a local florist in the recipients neighborhood that has good reviews and call them directly.
Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California intending to wear my newly fixed jeans and they said it wasn't ready They hadn't even started on it They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again 0 stars.
This is normally our fav place to eat - normally good sushi and great crab legs Normally last night EVERYTHING had been out for too long The sushi rice was hard the crab meat was grey inside the legs Service at the table was great but the food was horrible  We likely won't return.
Met a friend for dinner and drinks Ambiance is wonderful Good drinks Absolutely horrible food that was very expensive adding insult to injury I ordered the halibut The portion was thin and about the size of the palm of my petite hand and very salty and dry There was a very small serving of veggies The cost of the dinner was $2800  My friend got the Lobster Pasta A very small overcooked serving for $2500Terribly disappointing Would only return for HH.
No DD here  It's gone  I apparently can't find an actual DD near ASU.
Like the others below I ordered flowers through FTD and unfortunately the order was farmed out to Exclusive Flowers & Gifts It's pretty embarrassing when your CLIENT has to call you and thank you for the TERRIBLE DEAD MURKY ROTTING flowers that you sent to her in remembrance of her late father What makes matters worse is that when I requested a redelivery I was given attitude they insisted the original order be returned (because that's exactly what you want to do - inconvenience the RECEIVER of the gift to have to do something) and then the second batch was even worse than the first I'll never order FTD again and I highly recommend you avoid this shop it should be called EXCLUSIVELY CRAP FLOWERS & GIFTS.
Why did did i come back here  a 40 min drive north for what  with 200 fantastic places near me i certainly do NOT have to drive to be treated like a LEPER by a snotty uppity arogant serverWhen we walked into the bar area the entire bar was empty  For seating there were 2 tables: 1 person seated at a table 2 at the other  The girl behind the bar acted frenzied hurried and like she wsa serving 37 people  NO TIME FOR US - who were NOT LOCALS   was the crisp and very clear messageThe CRAP wine by the glass advertised on the chalk board was enough to send me running out the door: $5/glass for what is sold for the bottle retail (gnarly head voga 3 rivers - KAK)I went over to the wine rack and she said the Long Meadow Cab was on sale instead of $60 she offered it for $45  Since I had not had it previously i was hesitant  But I spotted a 1/2 bottle so (i thought) i was in luck  I asked her how much (thinking it would be HALF of the full bottle - like $22)   NOT  She said it was also the same price   W T H   are you kidding meHusband walked out i followed (especially after seeing her treat another 2 walk in's in a deplorable way - no reason to treat people like they are beneath you - EVER).
It's a shame to see so many awesome bands with shows at this Venue because no matter how great the band just the venue itself makes me not want to go see them  First off it is always ridiculously hot in this place I mean sweating here there everywhere so uncomfortable and unpleasant makes it really difficult to enjoy the show when you're standing there constantly fanning yourself and wiping sweat off your face  Secondly we waited almost an hour to just get through the doors even though we already had tickets  They need to come up with a better system they had ONE line only and ONE entrance for advanced tickets will call people who are buying at the door etc which was extremely inconvenient  You would think that they would have a line for will call a separate line for ticket holders at least The night we went the place was packed and there was only ONE bar and two bartenders and they were at MAX Capacity  Also the little gap that separated the 21+ was also the only way to get to the restrooms which was not to mention blocked by the ridiculous bar crowd waiting to get drinks  Over all I would not recommend coming to this venue for shows by far the worst experience  No matter how good the show was I still walked out saying this sucked because the venue sucked Saw two shows there and will probably not go back.

I had so many ppl tell me Sushi Brokers would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at especially having lived in Japan in for so long  I believe Hiro Sushi & have yet to find a find another place that can match them  When we walked in the loud hellish music reminded me of RA - I hate RA & their wanna ambience  Strike 1 against Sushi BrokersThe waitress was more intent on making a good impression with my boyfriend who was wearing his "Retired from the Air Force" polo than she was in addressing me  DEFINITELY STRIKE 2  I was happy to sign the check AND leave her a $01 tip in her hand  Yes I walked up to her and personally delivered itThe fish was SPOILED To the owners - if you don't know how to keep your fish at the right temperature learn and quickly  Your fish tastes horrible.
I hated this place I was there for work and I worked nights every morning at about 8 o'clock there would be music blaring right outside my room everyday I had to call and have them stop it They would take about a half hour well I was up by then The rooms were cramped and there was a sliding door that never quite closed on the bathroom door The location was nice But stay at the hilton across the street.
If you read this review please also read Nathan's comment belowI hesitated to write a negative review about this place because I know it is local but its food didn't taste local or homemade to me I am not exaggerating when I say a breakfast sandwich from PCrossant is no better than one from McDonalds  Pre-made lumps of single-colored scambled egg rubbery cheese watery sausage patty and a croissant that tastes like it has been refrigerated for days  Not flaky or buttery or soft on the inside  Kind of mashed down and a sickly yellow color  Meanest review ever  Sorry PCroissant  But it's true  I'll never go back.
After driving by McDowell Mountain Golf Club several times I wanted to play the course It looked fun and like a challenge That and PGA TOUR player Phil Mickelson owns the club I went to book a tee time and their website had tee times listed for $59 I found a tee time on GolfNowcom for $29 so I booked that When I arrived at the course there was no clubhouse That seems to be a trend in Arizona I then asked where the range was and was told I had to pay for practice balls I haven't paid for range balls all year and they wanted $6 for a small bag of balls The range was nice and had nice views but was brown I hoped the course didn't look like this It did The course was in HORRIBLE shape and should not be open I am sure they are getting ready to over seed but if that is the case close the course $10 would be a more acceptable tee time We saw the cart girl before we teed off Didn't see her again all day When we finished and brought that up the guy cleaning clubs said "Oh yeah she went home" Apparently she got off at noon because we teed off just before 12:30 I am glad that I played the course but I won't be playing there again The course was in awful shape and the rate was absurd for what we got I would rather play Papago they have green fairways.
Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries The red velvet cupcake was Just ok The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins They were good but I was expecting a cupcake The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.
Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation If they could hose the place down once in awhile it would definately get more stars from me.
My husband was after me to try this restaurant somehow i never got a good feel about it but we finally tried hated the food everything tasted bad some strange sweet svory taste that was not good we just ate whatever we could and hurried out of there.
Walked in during late lunch hour Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins When I finally got sat down and served my salad I found a hair in it Got no apology Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away You can't pay me to go back here The waiters are rude.
Service is the word or lack of it  WOW.
We have been regular customers here for several years and have always gotten the steampot for 2  The last time we were here we noticed that the food content had been cut in halfbut the price has remained the same  We won't be coming back.
This places STINKS And I mean that literally I've never smelt anything like it in my life  but what ever it is it forced me into being a mouth breather And finally I just had to get out .
A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take "requests"  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with "I own other restaurants"  I have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense people of Scottsdale)  It was unfortunate because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet.
One of these just opened by my house and my husband and I were really excited to try it because everyone says such great things I was so disappointed I agree that the fries were limp and I'm a crispy fry lover The burger tasted good but I felt pretty ill shortly after eating it Not food poisoning ill - more like over-greased ill I don't really eat fast food so maybe that's it but I will not be returning.
I went in to get a fill and called before to verify the price I was told it was only going to be 22 dollars After I was serviced they charged my card 40 dollars When I complained they said the fill was 17 and they charge and extra 20 for color I got French tip nails with no extra color or designs Do not go there Complete rip off and dishonest people.
I go to Paradise Bakery fairly regularly in Surprise and while it's not perfect the Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich and the chicken with wild rice soup call my name from time to time and I was taught to always come when I'm called  I was heading out to the Wigwam today and stopped in at this Paradise Bakery location for a bite  Lunch starts at 11 I stood right in front of the sandwich station watching a worker still making omelets and purposely said nothing wondering when or if she would ever look up at me  I do this from time to time to test the service and this PB failed I knew she knew I was there but she made a point not to make eye contact with me until my friend came over from the bakery side after ordering her smoothie to ask me what the hold up was I then said very loudly that I was still waiting for someone to take my sandwich order It was 11:15 The omelet worker never did look at me when she asked someone to come over and take my order  I placed my order for my sandwich and then got my soup I had to wait for an employee to wander over to the cash register and then realize she didn't have a cash drawer in order to pay More meadering employees before the cash drawer came  I didn't get my sandwich until 11:30 I ordered a 1/2 chicken walnut salad sandwich Nothing specialno changes to it It took 15 minutes to get it and that would be 30 minutes after changing to lunch That's unacceptable I will skip this location in the future not just because of the slow change-over to lunch on a slow day but because the employees were just indifferent and slow and this is often indicative of a poor management team I can spend my money at better places.
Not that impressed  Maybe I should have read other reviews from Google (http://mapsgooglecom/maps/placehl=en&safe=strict&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=suntown&fb=1&gl=us&hq=suntown&cid=9747720966802647969)  Regardless I took two white shirts and black capris in Both shirts came back with stains still on them I mention this because I took them to another cleaner and the stains were gone  Again not impressed  :(.
First walking in I was hesitate  It looks really dirty and in poor condition  The service was horrible  We were seated and took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order  People who came in after us had their order taken before us When we arrived there was about five tables that still had dirty plates on them  When we left they were still there They had probably been like that for an hour  The food was good but the sides are portioned very poorly  I really don't recommend this place Go someone where else  The Service sucks.
I am honestly shocked by the amazing reviews for this restaurant We read them and went with such high expectations of amazing food and atmosphere Maybe it was our fault we were so let down but we won't make the mistake of going here ever again We walked in to find that it was a complete dive Flies were buzzing about and servers were standing around bored It just seemed so dirty and unkempt Ok maybe the food would blow us awayWe read reviews on the fabulous fresh baked bread so we knew we had to order sandwiches My sandwich was mostly dry shredded iceberg with a blob of mayo dry turkey that looked like it met its fate under a lawnmower Thank god I paid extra for avocado and bacon because those were the only things I could taste at all The bread was so BLAND and plasticky It was just not good And it was beyond expensive for what we got If you have a palate more sophisticated than that of a 4 year old this is not the place for you.
I have tried to eat here off and on for the 8 years I've lived here NONE OF THEM WERE FULL ACCLOMPISHED TRIPS I tried to order something just on the 4th of July They weren't all that busy so I walked in and sat at the bar next to the TO GO register I was in a hurry to get back to work because I only have 30 minutes for lunch I was greeted by a hefty young man and was told someone will be with me shortly Ten minutes come and go and the same large waitress walks past me 4 times without a hello and I can't seem to find the young man on top of this the very freakie store manager is behind the counter helping prepare orders which are flying off the counter fast The manager looks at me often and never does anything but stare at me like a creepy old perv 4 very loud women run in to the opposite side of the counter and the large waitress tells them hello and they quickly place an order for fries and onion rings Shortly after the 4 women pay for their order the large girl walks away like I wasn't sitting there with a menu and waiting for *someone*This place can go to hell I'm just going to act like this place never existed and warn others to do the same.
Stopped in this morning to get breakfast for my team and got a huge serving of bad attitude from the staff  This is the first and last time I'll set foot in this place I'll go up the street to Einstein's where I can get food without the 'tude.
Ordered online Went to pick up meal and it wasn't ready They quickly prepared the meal and when I got home I found that they had prepared everything incorrectly  We were missing 2 items one item mistakenly contained shrimp (which one patron in our party has a sever allergy) we had one pasta dish that we didn't order It was a disaster When I called toilet them know the manager told me there was nothing they could do because they were busy but did offer to give me a $7 off coupon the next time I came in all I had to do was let them know when I order againI won't order again.
4 starsare you people kidding me Me thinks I cannot trust yelp any longer.
Worst place ever No credit card machine no ice no pizza Close the doors already.
I drive it every day and I think it is a freewayWhy are we reviewing freeways This is lame I'm leavingPS yes it's good for kids to play in Wait that was the 17.
OK so heres the thing These guys got their "one of the hottest ramen noodle joints in the country yada yada" nod before they were even open Can you say great marketing team Absolutely and the place is really nice looking but it's NOT good And this is not an "authentic" vs not authentic thing as many people have taken one side or the other for I could care less if it was authentic as long as it tasted good which it does not Flavorless greasy over cooked this under cooked that The miso broth pork bowl was the biggest travesty of them all There were 4 of us and there were so many holes in the execution of the dishes that it just felt clumsy andyes had you wishing for a more seasoned team (which may be why many people are screaming for "authenticity" by authentic they may just be saying they want something thats goodor at the very least something worth the price tagwhich in this case is a little exorbitant compared to their competition  Base price of most dishes is already on the border and then come the add ons Add Ons which are not add ons in other places that serve ramen Bad form they essentially even charge you extra for flavor Bottom line authentic not authenticI would rather spend my money in a place where the dishes come WITH the flavor included in the price If you can make it down to Ahwatukee Sushi Ken's got some stellar ramen Ramen Republic not too shabby either I would skip this one though There are so many places where you'll be paying for a lot less than an awesome marketing team tells you you should pay for this kind of thing and get a whole lot more.
I've gone here a couple of times and all times it sucked I sat at the bar and when I tried to ask them about the sushi on the menu they weren't sure what was what seeing as how the menu mixes everything and doesn't have whether it's baked or raw And when I did get my miso soup it tasted awful and was cold The sushi wasn't even that fresh either Made me sick.
This place is terrible  We should've known when we sat down and there was not 1 asian person in this place (including the workers)  One of the rolls we got was the lotus  It tasted dirty and like lighter fluid (it is served surrounded by a flame)  There were 3 of us in our party tonight and we all left feeling sick  Not only would I not go back to this place I would encourage all of my friends NOT to patronize this place.
So where do I start There was a long line to get in so the foods has got to be good Only problem is that I never made it inside to eat My friend and I arrived and it wasn't what i had expected I thought it would be a local neighborhood bar with good food It's not it's a tinie tiny diner that looked kind of dumpy We walked in and added our names to the long list We tried waiting inside but the ogling from the sex predator cook made it strange and we had to sit outside After waiting for 10 min the hostess came out and was looking for a party that had already left due to the wait she called their name and when there wasn't a response she just grabbed a couple that had just arrived What  This place is crap We were waiting We ended up leaving and going to Liberty Market now that place is great Sorry I hate leaving bad reviews but it was a terrible experience.
I feel bad about this but why I'm the one who spent Friday night throwing up  I walked in to pick up my to-go order of Red Curry Chicken with brown rice only to find a woman ordering the very same thing  She enthusiastically praised the red curry and said that I would love it  After that and the mostly good reviews on Yelp I thought I was in for a treat  The funny thing is it was really good  I thought that I found a great little gem  The curry had tons of veggies and they even had brown rice I was pleased as punch  Skip forward to the next morning and I was feeling nauseous by the afternoon I was in flat out pain and well I won't tell you the rest  I can only equate it to that meal all I had before it was fruit and a piece of toast for breakfast and a Lean Cuisine for lunch  I started feeling slightly ill that night after my dinner from La's and it progressed steadily from thereI feel bad because the meal was good and obviously the lady who so enthusiastically recommended the curry hadn't experienced this before  I wish I could call her and ask her if she got sick too  Maybe this was a fluke but I'm sure as hell scared to try it again   So if you wanna know if the curry was good- yes it was  I would have given it 4 maybe even 5 stars unfortunately ruining my weekend brings it down to 1 star  I feel compelled to say that the place seemed clean and the employee who helped me was nice I am sad that I won't be going back  Just don't say I didn't warn you  Maybe just stay away from the curry.
good food bad service recommend just doing take out.
This used to be my favorite place to get some beer or whatever my kitchen was lacking I am now changing my opinion Starting with the fact that they are very overpriced in a college town I spend $20 on two 6-packs Well the worst part was that one of the 6-packs was stale skunk whatever you want to call it but GROSS I drank one and thought something was weird Well after one sip of the second beer I knew it was nasty So the next day I went back hoping to simply exchange the sixer for one that was fresh The man working gave me strange looks and never apologized He said well that's the born on date OK I understand that but what I am saying is that I drank this beer and it tasted like dirt Granted it's the same brand of beer I always drink and I've shopped at T's many many times I did not appreciate his unwillingness to help me After I spent enough money to justify going to a happy hour on beer I would hope that a customer service oriented person would at least say "That's weird man I'm sorry- let me get you a different one" Needless to say but I will anyways- I left the remaining beers on his counter and will not return.
This place is a joke There is nothing resort like about it The organization has been pathetic the rooms  are less than impressive and you are by nothing interesting Don't waste your time Save your money up and go to your local holidays inn cause it is no different Anybody that even for a second considers buying a time share here is off their rocker.
There is NO parkingseveral owners are in litigation with the developerThe board is ever changing and it's a messOwners are walking away from there places.
HelloAnd I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant  who ever they are  to read it and wake up Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this placeLet's start at the beginning went for lunch walked in saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us NOPE nothing of the sorts walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance again what do I do next People inside look at you but don't ask to help you We had our dog with us so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out She walked to the counter and again no one would help Can I order Then a person replied and pointed "you start down there" Okay great were getting somewhere She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich"  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich  OH the daymare has just started After about 20 minutes she sent me a text and said" I haven't left you still waiting" This is Chicken Salad People slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go Here's where it gets really good several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting she taps on the window and asks " is there a problem with the chicken salad"  "I'll check"  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said "how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich" he had been waiting 30 minutesWe eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food nothing to write home about and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  "This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return"Their response exactly like the whole experience started NOTHINGAnd although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED.
After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands It was an issue of "protecting the thumbs" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and I assume her elbows too) After just five minutes when I asked for more pressure she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the "therapist for [me]" She was right What are they teaching these people these days and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff I won't offer her name but if considering a massage at this establishment I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.
If I could give less than one I would  What a joke this place is I have lived here since 1989 and never made it until last Saturday following Wicked at Gammage  I knew about the Happy Hour so the timing was perfect service is a zero food is a zero  Shrimp San Remo while it had a good flavor The shrimp were very tough and chewy  Best Seafood in AZ  Not  Baked stuffed Clams hot and the stuffing was bone dry  New England Clam Chowder very watery thin broth not many clams to be found $400 for a bread basket that you get for free everywhere else  Say what  Dining in the restaurant was all but done and the staff in the bar were more interested in socializing with each other $5500 later and NO tip I am outta there never to return  Not sure who is in charge there (rhetorical)  Attend at your own risk  I think that most of the reviewers with 5 star rating are too embarrassed to admit they paid a hundred dollars or more for Coco's quality seafood.
Big clean store but nothing in it  Where's all the merchandise and how does this place stay open with seemingly nothing to sell  I prefer Marshalls.
We always have enjoyed going to Olive Garden in the past and this experience really changed my opinion of Olive Garden all together We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and really were looking forward to having a great experience as always The bread-sticks are tasty the salads and soups are always a pleasure to try since they seem to always have new ones coming out from time to time But my issue is with the management and because of that our experience has tarnished Olive Garden in our eyes Our server comes over and asks us for drinks I have a glass of wine and my husband has a Italian margarita We order our app and  a salad and my husband finishes his margarita and our server asks him if  he would like another He agrees and asks her to order in another shot of tequila because the first margarita was a little light She says okay and when she comes back with his margarita following right behind her is the Manager and asks him why he wants an additional shot he explains and the GM then goes on long explanation on why they cant add additional shots in the drink and said moving forward tonight we are not going to be serving you any more alcoholic drinks I was shocked Two drinks and you are cut off Maybe the manager was having a bad day or maybe they only let you order two drinks But this coming from a place where they are always pushing their wine and always go as far to leaving you a whole jug of it at your table this came off as a little odd  My husband is a good sized man and two drinks and cut off I thought was a little too much Most importantly this was rude and unprofessionalThis ruined our evening and it was very difficult for us to take anything positive from this Since our order was in we waited for our entrees ate them paid the bill and left I can honestly say that we are never coming back to Olive Garden in the future I went online the next day and filled in the contact us questionnaire so that we could be contacted by someone at corporate and let someone know how not to treat customers that have been so loyal for so many years now but to this day I have yet to be contacted back not an email or a call What a disappointment where customer service goes such a long way Apparently not to Olive Garden.
Expensive  Problem with this place is that a guy with SUPER greasy hands took my keys and my got in my car yup you guessed it grease all over my door handle shifter steering wheel car keys just disgusting  Will NEVER go back.
Just when you think airport food is improving-along comes Taberna Del Tequileria Blue corn quesidilla with pork so dry I had to drown it in salsa (in the stupid little cups - like another reviewer pointed out) in order to choke it down $10 'house' maragarita come on-it was a flavorless glass of ice slushGlad to get back to my 'home' airport (PDX) where they have real restauranteurs running their own places that take pride in what they serve.
First time I went they were out of 4 or 5 items so I came back a few days later got some crappy overcooked Mac and cheese flavorless brisket on a cold hard bun Went back today and they were closed during hours posted Place won't see the new year.
I have to agree with the other reviewers on their views of this pizza hut It's a real shame because a real pizza hut where that you can actually sit down and enjoy a pizza with your family is becoming a rare thing indeed Many of them have converted to the take out/delivery only format I was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in Casa Grande Unfortunately the service quickly tamed any excitement I was feeling over the location and style of the restaurant Every time we eat here we are greeted by consistant rude and unprofessional service My wife is a huge fan of pizza hut so we deal with the terrible service because we have toit's the only pizza hut in town If it was up to me we would stick to T and M pizza all the time and ignore this establishment entirely.
I visit the Gilbert and Warner location frequently I've had fairly consistently good service and food at that location This location is another storyAfter taking our drink order (waters and soda) it took over 10 minutes for the server to actually bring it blaming the bar for the delay even though she filled the cups at the soda station next to our table After our food was ordered half the food was brought to our table right away leaving half our party without their meals for another 10 minutes We had two orders of wings One order was covered in sauce the other had a dab on each piece It was $60 for an extra side of sauce After clearing our food we waited 15 minutes for the server to bring our bill then another 10 for our server to actually run payment Needless to say she got a $200 tip on a $4000 billIf you are in Gilbert just go to the one on Gilbert and Warner The service is better the food is better it was worth the drive.
The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers With that being said this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening thereBeing new to the Tempe area myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later) As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover seriously We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts We ordered foodThe food arrived in a timely manner it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger 9 dollars-ish If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine I had immediate food regret my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set Surreal   We regrettably paid and escaped out the back Good: Cheap Drinks   Bad: You may be stabbed.
So many good reviews and coworkers highly recommendations made me go to this place I had my doubts but we try everything at least onceWe went on Saturday around 4pm the place was almost empty We got seated right away our server was ok and he did a pretty decent jobOn to the food: it was bland So very bland I was hoping I would've carried tabasco or something in my purse to add flavorThe bread that they keep bringing to your table that was the only thing good I had that day and that's why I gave it 1 starWe ordered the hummus as appetizer and it was ok nothing to write back homeI had the plate with chicken and filet mignon it wasn't good it was a $20 bucks dish I was really expecting something good the beef and chicken seem to be pre-boiled because the meat felt soggy kinda like a wet piece of bread it had a bit of charbroiled marks on them but it didn't had the flavor of the charbroiled it tasted so bland like I was eating boiled chicken and beef it was so chewy I only ate 2 bites of it and I was done I asked for the "burned rice" that was recommended it's some sort of crispy rice it was awful my jaw was hurting from chewing it and I was felling a tooth could breakMy husband had the kobideh and chicken combo with the regular yellow rice he also thought the chicken tasted odd like a boiled chicken no flavor the kobideh he liked at the beginning but then he said it just didn't taste good anymore could be because it was very cold there and the food got cold pretty quickly He did like the hummus however very muchFor my kid we order the chicken kebab it also came with rice - he ate it fine but I have a kid who never complains lol (lucky for me)And that was our meal our server was nice and the service was a little slow but not something will make me not go back however the food is making me close the chapter on Persian Room Everybody keeps saying that the portions are huge they are not they look huge because of the plate is served and the way is display on it but they aren't really huge they are normal size they do fill it with rice You also feel full pretty fast because of the bread and the rice so you may think it's a lot of food but it's more like a lot of starchThe place is a far drive overpriced tastes bland not need to say we won't be backIt has also a weird location in front of a hotel remained me of a Denny's Oh and by the time we were leaving the place was packed so I'm guessing overpricing food makes you think the food must be amazing well fortunately I know is not the caseOne thing to add we left a little hungry with our food boxed (then to the garbage) and with that little taste of the Persia we had we got a little sick so we actually had to stop in a store to use the restrooms :(.
Horrible experience I went in for what I thought was a kidney infection Although i had tender kidneys and bladder i was diagnosed with a uti because "i didn't look sick enough" Doctor came in chewing as if I was interrupting her lunch and spent less then 5 minutes with me I asked her if I had a fever as i was leaving and her response was "I don't know Did you have one at home" I will NEVER go back to this place.
I love Red Lobster's endless shrimp and delicious biscuits however I'm sitting here writing this review at my table because I've been here for an hour and a half so far and have yet to get my food Drink refills are impossible to obtain because our server can't figure it out In fact he disappears for 20 minutes at a time without resurfacing from behind the kitchen doors I couldn't even leave if I wanted to because I can't get my check I'll update my review with food reviews if our food ever arrives.
Dont waste your time and money with this company I had Heliocol install solar panels for our pool including a brand new pool pump The system was installed four months ago and never worked We have been calling for service since then and every time someone comes to fix it  the problem stays the same We are going to take legal action They got the money and we got promises.
DON'T EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT CLEANING FLUIDS AND OTHER DEBRIS IN YOUR FOOD We were eating at this location about 1-2 times a month but no more not after what we saw today We were seated near the food area and looked up to see staff cleaning the food stands and vents above the food and prep areas Debris was falling in the food and the cleaning fluids were being sprayed over the food DISGUSTING I spoke to the supervisor and she could not care less Don't eat here unless you want to get sick.
I would not even give this store one star but this site makes me do it We ordered pizza at 7 pm it arrived at 748pm  The driver explained he bought our pop at Fry's because the store was out KUDOS TO HIM HOWEVER the girl Elaina not sure if thats her name she doesnt speak clearly took our order 4 times And still didnt get it right She is a liar And I will further elaborate but I wanted to express we are surprised the driver made it We repeated the address 5 times and the phone number 6 times She was short with me on the phone We expressed the only reason we order from your store is for the cheese sauce Which should be in the notes next to my name THIS LIAR SAID SHE EVEN WROTE IT ON THE BOX AND BLAMED HER MISTAKE ON THE DRIVER  THE ONLY THING ON THE BOX IS A SMILIE FACE AND IF I COULD INSTAGRAM THAT ON THIS SITE I WOULD TO FURTHER EMBARRASSE HER AND THE STORE The driver did his job She failed him by not doing her job She exercised very poor communication skills She spoke like we were some dam kid on the phone her only response was "I dont know Ugh I Just don't Know" I Know how bout you place us on hold and find out WE know it was a waste of our time but we called back to find out where the cheese sauce was and we knew after she gave us the run around the drive would have NO CLUE we're suppose to get some So she needs fired or retrained if you think she is worth the investment It is now 909pm and still no cheese sauce Thats awful.
Very bad experience here Service was beyond bad and the sub was at best just average.
This particular Cracker Barrel in Mesa is where I have had the worst dining experience of my life My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone Our table was moved because oops No one's working that section of the restaurant It took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken We had a couple people stop by and say someone will be right with you someone will be right with you We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it And started placing their order By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish Can I sub this for that) The waitress literally said "Could you please hurry up I have other tables to wait on" My sister sat there with her mouth open flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already By the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care I was hungry My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd I don't think we saw our "actual" server the entire time we were there The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy They had sections closed off Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job Too long didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken you should consider leaving before you even start I recommend Logan's Roadhouse.
Very poor.
Never will I go to this again There was NO organization We waited in our car for over 45min to park(should have left then) We then paid to park $5 Then it was $10 to get in We waited in line for 2hrs and moved 30 ft and still had 50ft to go We left at that point with out eating one thing DO NOT GO TO THIS EVENT NEXT TIME.
If you like sushi go somewhere else I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good however either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in tasteThe staff had great smiles yet lacked follow through We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen Although poor in quality they were high in price for what they serve I'm not sure about the names of some of their rollsone was named "Climax" Gross and just distasteful  The decor and ambiance leave you wanting They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi.
My husband and I live nearby so we decided to give it a try even though we think the best Thai in the valley is in downtown Phoenix at the wild Thaiger where we eat weekly We ordered a curry dish a noodle dish and the Tom ka soup All had a flavor that neither of us cared forvery bitter and rancid tasting The beef in the curry had lots of fatty gristle on it and the Tom ka was severely lacking in coconut milk I only had a bite of everything and then opted for a Wendy's hamburgerThat's  how unimpressed I was This place may be close to home but you can bet I won't be returning Steer clear of this one.
This company is horrible They have the "small business feel" of three people that seem inconvenienced when you want to rent a truck from them They like to claim things are fraud that actual successful businesses do everyday They have horrible customer service skills and even work business practice/ethics Thanks to them i'll never use another budget truck rental again - our company used them often I will pay extra money for adequate service theirs wasn't even that.
I had the Pollo Diablo formerly named Pollo Magnifico  They renamed it because they added more cream cheese so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing so I went with that  Pollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese served with a side of beans and rice  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already  The fried touch made it not quite crispy just a little greasy  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree  Nothing worth taking with me eitherThe worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating  They are big heavy portions  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands his eyes drooping  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating too  This was heavy stuffI'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better but for this California girl I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.
We went there to watch the AFC championship Our waiter was rude and condensing  Food was bad I won't go there again.
really sad  really small  I am used to farmers markets in other cities  I try not to compare but cant help it when it takes a whole 5 minutes to navigate the whole market  an awful lot of non local products at way to high a price  I did run into a local resident I met when I moved to phoenix 1 1/2 months ago and turns out it was his first time here  also his last he said  I am also an animal lover and a crowded market is no place for dogs and non supervised children  the lawyers would have a great time with it  save your hard earned money and go to sprouts.
Your clever double entendre of a name won't win me over "daily grind" if that is your real name Honestly there are so many excellent coffee and tea shops in the valley that it would be a waste to settle for this.
I hate to hand out single star badges of honor on here but this place deserves it  When they first opened a review would have been 4 stars but lately the service from inside and wash staff drops it to one star  The last 2 times we have taken our cars in they have not been very clean including them not even trying to vacuum out the back of my wife's SUV last time she was there  To top it off when she went to pay with a coupon that can be printed off of their website at this moment they refused to accept the coupon saying that the prices have changed and we "need to deal with it"  Mind you this coupon has no expiration date on it and is currently active on the web  We finally got a hold of a manager who was not to thrilled to correct the pricing error and lastly they charged us for an extra quart of oil when their oil changes come with 5 quarts and according to the manual the engine holds just under 5 quarts  Wont be going here again.
If you own a Mexican restaurant how on earth can you mess up beans  There's nothing worse than going to a Mexican restaurant and their beans have no flavor WHAT-SO-EVER  To add to my disappointment the chicken tacos I ordered were saturated with grease and lacked flavor too  I hope the owner reads this because she needs to have the cook taste the food he's preparing before they serve it  Salt is your friend Maybe even some pepper and garlic if you're adventurous  Thank God for the little bit of salsa they gave me it was the only thing to make my tacos edible  I ended up tossing the frijoles in the garbage  What a waste of food.
Decided to spend New Years here and giving them much of my business you would expect to have more respect here Their New Years party said to be free before 11 and a group of 25 of us get there at 945 to make sure that we get in and not have to wait in a horrid line which we end up doing anyway The manager of junkie and bouncer would not accept their own claim for the free admission like it says on their FB and flier they promoted and they should be confronted on their baiting advertisement which is completely illegal and should be sued I have dumped way to much money on them to receive this type of treatment They are all on their high horses and feel like they are doing us a favor for coming there and spending our moneythey have it all wrong.
Beef that tastes fishy & other awful experiencesThe arguments that I have seen for this restaurant on other sites as to whether or not it's authentic Mexico City food is not even going to be brought up here there are plenty of other things wrong with this restaurant and the food that simply go against common decent mealsFirst of all it should be noted that unlike most restaurants especially Mexican restaurants chips and salsa and non-alcoholic beverages come with 1 refill only after that you have to pay for extra  The bowl of chips is small - my fellow diner and I went through it quickly waiting for our appetizer  Then after the bowl was empty we were never - never even throughout the entire meal - offered our 'refill' for chips  I understand a restaurant may not want to be wasteful but this is just cheap and tackySecond of all all of the menu items are about $200 overpriced compared to other Mexican or TexMex places I have been to  $1099 goes about as far as 2 tiny - empty - "cheese" enchiladas (about 4 inches long w/little inside but cheese suffocating the outside) and two tacos with some meat blobbed on and nothing else  In Mexico this should run me about $400 and in other AZ Mexican restaurants about $899Third the food was just plain awful  Nevermind the appetizer of the skillet of cheese - think cheese pizza without the pizza with extra oil and a nauseating stomachache to follow  We couldn't even eat half of it  And there's no dipping - although hot it's harder cheese that has to be cut with a knife  Then onto the aforementioned enchiladas and tacos  The shredded beef tasted like fish  Makes me wonder what's going on in their kitchen  I lifted up the taco and water poured - not dripped poured - out of the shell explaining why the shell was then soggy and vile  Think wet cardboard  I ate half of the first taco and couldn't stomach it any longer  The enchiladas exemplify the cook's answer to everything - drench and hide the food in cheese and sauce  Nothing was inside except a tad of what seeped in from the outside  I didn't touch the beans - they too looked like they were soaking in a bowl of water but I tried the rice: no texture - almost mush very bland  This should be one of the basicsAnd buyer beware: the "Suiza" sauce - which at first glance on the menu one might assume that the sauce is a special house sauce that adds that great vibrant kick to food - is actually just sour cream  Whether they were trying to just sound unique or what on the menu I don't know but as someone who doesn't like sour cream this is only a nuisance  The serviceI suppose E for Effort  Neither of us ate hardly any of the "food" (and we aren't the 'send-it-back' type people) and the waitress was completely oblivious  When she asked if we liked it I gave a look like - no - and my boyfriend said it was 'okay' and we clearly didn't want any boxes - you'd think something might have been done at that time - since she did *ask*but no  We were sent on our way and told to "come back soon"  Nice but denseOverall Mexican or not this can't be a good representation of Mexico  If a Mexican restaurant can't get tacos right they shouldn't be in business  I would never waste another dime there and would discourage friends as well  Bad food overpriced with severely lacking servicethat's probably why the place was nearly empty when we were there on what should have been a busier Wednesday night.
My husband and I just walked out without bothering to order anything  We sat down at a half booth half table in the bar next to a large party and were greeted by a young man named Aaron  He immediately told us the table was reserved as the party next to us had more people comingthats funny I didn't know you could reserve tables in a bar during HH  So here I am 9 months pregnant told to get up and move to an uncomfortable high top  My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time Thanks Aaron we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location  As we got up to leave he sarcastically said goodbye and proceeded to be argumentative with my husband when he told him that his customer service skills were seriously lacking Its a shame because we live right down the street and used to come here 2-3 times a month.
The CompoundThis venue does not honor their contracts with artists that perform at the premisesdo not play this event unless you are prepared to receive a BS story about why they wont pay there contractual obligation despite your band packing the house with at least 250 people their music director "Kyle Day" is a liar cheat and participates in un-ethical business practicesAKAArsehole.
Food was Pretty good beer was cold but service was shitty at best.
Does not exist at this location.
Its almost a crime to call this Hawiian foodthe mac salad had zero flavor the bbq chicken was marginal at best and the pineapple chicken sauce was gross the only reason they get 1 star is because the white rice was good and sticky very unsatisfying.
This place sucked was great then sucked again Finally it is out of business and can quit playing with my emotions.
Workers are always in terrible mood They are rude and negative I prefer to go to 19801 N 59th Ave Glendale AZ.
Tried calling last week and the phone number was disconnected but the website was still up  Tried the website this morning to try to contact them again and it's now gone  Those of us who still have certificates from buywithmecom are out our money  From the sounds of the reviews I wouldn't have much cleaner of a house had they come out anyway.
Nothing but reckless far-right rhetoric lies & spin Constant Democrat & Obama-bashing Instead listen to 1480 AM KPHX "Progressive" Talk Radio in Phoenix  Stephanie Miller in the Mornings then Thom Hartmann Randi Rhodes in the afternoon.
I must say Radio Milano was my all time FAVORITE restaurants in phoenix which I never reviewed because everyone already knew how fabulous it was  Logging into today to realize the venue change has left me somewhere between completely inconsolable and totally suicidal  WHY WHY WHYYYYYY would you do that to us LGO  I HATE SUSHI WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
Terrible service The wait staff has real attitude problem Mongolian beef was chewy  Moo shu pork plain additional charge for more wrappers Overpricedfor what you get Go somewhere else.
The guy at the front desk was very condescending on the phone and when I arrived  They only actually changed my oil but marked they put a new filter in and vacuumed/cleaned windows  I thought my coolant was low but they said the fluids were all fine  Well I checked again today  No coolant at all and my engine is running hot  Awesome job guys.
Sorry don't agree with most of ya yelpers on this place I wanted to stop by this place for awhile so Sunday I took the trip down here to see what some of the fuss was all about Cheap good food drew me in and I'm a sucker for fish tacos I drove up to this place thinking yes this does look like a hippies house with all the misc crap placed all over the walls ceilings and windows I wouldn't say it had much of the beach vibe I think they were going for or maybe it's just me I have lived most of my life in San Diego and near the Beach and most little beach shacks I've been to have a different vibe to them On the board it said something like famous fish taco's or something like that I thought oh yes then got to try those I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of "don't order the fish taco's your in the middle of the freakin desert there is no ocean for hundreds of miles" but no I had to order them Taco's were cheap like $2 a piece The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff We waited about five minutes and our order was up While waiting I was looking around at all the mess that was placed everywhere and was wondering how this tied into there "theme"   And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub or at least a dustingOK our order was up and we sat in the back on some picnic benches It was hot but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there We opened up our fish taco's and noticed wow these are huge They piled all sorts of stuff in there cabbage rice ton's of cheese fish some sort of secret sauce all on a flour kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand) Grabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco Blahhhh it was the fish Oh man the fish killed it taste so fishy and soggy it was gross Next don't ask me why I did it but I thought I'd try it again So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again Blahhhh gross gross gross The sauce didn't help at all There sauce had no heat to it and the fish was just as bad as the first bite I had bought two taco's and looked in back of me and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat They said no man where good So I couldn't even give these away for free We drove off grossed out and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out Soda wasn't doing the trick I remember saying to my husband in the car driving off I don't feel good I think I'm going to puke really my stomach hurt and in no way do I have a sensitive stomach Like others had said I really did want to like this place but no way I'll ever ever return Sorry.
I've gone to this salon several times an usually only as my second or third choice This past visit will definitely be the last I made an appointment for the first available (once they opened) for a mani/pedi for myself and two pedis for my sisters We walk in for our appointment and there are only two people working and they already had 4 people in the chairs doing pedis Then they state that they only had us marked down for the mani/pedi and didn't have the pedis marked for an appointment Regardless I made the first appointment of the day we show up 5 minutes early but they are already working on four other people What's the point of even making an appointment if they won't honor it and hold your spot Then the technician that did my nails was extremely opinionated and would constantly insult and talk me out of what I wanted I went in to get my nails done for my wedding and had a wry specific idea in mind However did not leave with what I wanted Very disappointed Plus both my sisters pedis were done poorly and are already peeling not even 12 hours later.
RUDE staff that wouldn't spit on you if you were on Fire mixed up our party's orders ignored us when we needed waters  Honestly it was the attitude of the staff that completely turned me OFF to this historic restaurant.
So I hear on Thursdays Gameworks has a $10 play-all-night and $2 shots (and other misc drink specials) from 9 to close http://wwwgameworkscom/tId=1&sId=14Sweet They have a DOCWE table so I lugged my husband out and the kiddo (whose regular bedtime is midnight due to our schedules so don't even go there) Get there at 8 and decide to pass the time by getting a bite The waitress was sweet and lovely and made sure we were well taken care ofSo 9pm rolls around I want to order a drink to take with me to the table Why not I have a designated driver and kid-taker-care-of-er and its been a long week so a drink or three sounds fab "The drink specials don't start until 10" says the bartender "Thats not what the sign in front says" says I Shrug Drink specials don't start til 10 We at Gameworks like false advertisementSo I order my $10 play all night card and will be back at 10 for my drink Get the card obligatory $2 card fee and sit down at the DOCWE table One race and the card stops working We go WTF to the manager and he says some games aren't available with the card 1 We know your sign says redemption games and a few others DOCWE wasn't on that Nor is it a redemption game 2 The waitress said it was fine way to make her look like a jerk So we ask for a refund "You want a refund on a card you've already played on" after a few sarcastic remarks from my husband we are told our transaction had been canceledWe walked out the front door disappointed and frazzled We walked right past the sign that we had seen when we walked in no mention of the DOCWE machine and said drink specials started at 9For the record we also heard several other people complaining about the sign I took a picture of it and if my phone cooperates I'll post it here as well Melissa is right it smelled pretty bad downstairs I figured it was all the kids Dave and Busters doesn't stink and of course they will continue to get my business and the hundreds upon hundreds of dollars I sink into that damn DOCWE machine and happy hour beers.
Ugh talk about douchebag centralWe came here looking for some dinner (as in: entrees) but their menu left much to be desired in the "actual food" department so we ordered the damn "cheese and meat plate" which was boring small and tasted terrible We also had like 7 different servers for some inexplicable reason who wouldn't listen to ANY of our requests to stop filling up our water glasses every 3 seconds We didn't want water we wanted food  We ended up going across the street to the Italian joint because we wanted real food instead of a frikkin crackers and crappy lunch meatThis is good for the whole Ed-Hardy-40-something-year-old-popped-collar crowd and their 22 year year-old consorts to meet up from their ads on Craigslist but otherwise this place is awfulwhich is weird because their sister business The Windsor is absolutely amazing.
This is my second order and by accident I ordered from them months ago and swore never again But it just so happened that I get so many flyers on my door that this one slipped through First things first I ordered pork and veg And chicken and veg for myself as I only eat chicken fish and turkey Reason I say that is because I received chicken and veg with shrimp and veg Guess who's deathly allergic to shrimpThe food was bland dry and Luke warm The fried rice is the worst I ever tasted Salty and dry And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice I almost thought it was spoiled food The lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen Why would I order shrimp ladyAlso she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints I didn't check yelp before I placed my order if I had this would all have been avoidedShe offered to refund my money forty min ago If she does I will post it later if she doesn't I will go postal I only wish I paid with a credit card so I could dispute this and not worry about a refund ItIf you're thinking about placing  an order don't waste your money It would be better spent on burritos out of the freezer at the local Circle KNever again Chopsticks  ExpressOk they delivered my refund But not before I received my two subs from Jimmy Johns Expresslol what a joke.
Ok first off I have been a long time and I mean long time customer of Verizon Wireless I'm talkin 15 years So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package I called Verizon's customer service that day the 27th and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all Specifically my unlimited data plan In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also They told him the same thing that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to So fast forward to today June 20th I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to I'm like what I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract He told me and these were his words "Well the lied to you" WTH I was majorly p'd off I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out So I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence the Verizon rep Blah blah blah can I please speak to your manager 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes) Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone She apologizes not in a nice way and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question I call BS on that I called one day before the new "plans" rolled out You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one I think not Long story short she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service Good luck to all of you who have not upgraded yet.
The worst business service you could possibly get I am going to complain to Groupon for offering such a bad buy This person booked my appointment then on arriving at address I was told she had moved After a lot of asking I was given the intersection of her new address Arrived there couldn't find it Someone else looked up and got the new address for me I put it into the GPS and arrived but there was no such place I phoned many times but she wouldn't pick up Beware It seems like a scam.
OkSo here's the deal You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world  I feel horrible doing this but I mean come on Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food)  But what got me more then the horrible food was the service  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone Than It took another 10 for her to come out  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table  The food was cold service was slow and it was not worth the money  I vow to never go there again There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place.
Don't waste your time The waitresses are beyond slow and once they are done flirting with the table next to you she might  visit your table and then disappear.
It appears that with the litigation fiasco underway this car wash had left its doors open to collect monies to pay for attorney fees How else could one explain the painfully horrific car wash I received yesterday Now I'm typically the last one to complain but when I have to go home to wipe down my car with a damp washcloth and re-wash my windowsthat pretty pathetic Please do us all a favor and just close your doors.
This review is for the service dept of Shasta pools not a store I've never had a problem with the guys who came to do the work on my pool equipment The problem is with the people who answer the phone I noticed last time I called I would be put on hold by the automated system for a long time (like maybe 10 minutes or more) The only way to get to talk to someone was to leave a message then I got a call back within minutes I thought that was really strange It happened twice So I scheduled a service call A few days before it was going to happen I had something come up and needed to cancel I called again had to leave a message after being on hold to speak to a person When the rep looked on the schedule she said it was never even put in the system Too strange for me I'm not calling them again.
Lasy nite we were there about 7 pm It so incredibly LOUD I had to yell to be heard over the noise I ordered the A1 pepercorn burg and my girlfriend ordered the `prime rib sandwich There was no silverware when our food got to usThe waitress said all the utensils were dirty or havent come out of the dishwasher  My girlfriends sandwich and the coleslaw on her plate was warmslaw should be cold She bit into the sandwichhad a funny look on her face and pulled out a broken toothpick The toothpicks that were in her sandwich originally were not broken The manager was informed about this and picked the entire check upbut we would never go back there.
Ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be Way over priced.
This is in NO WAY a 3 1/2 star WalgreensI've been here 6 times and it's a NO STAR My last visit broke the camel's backThe last trip has to do with the pharmacy BS experienceDr called in prescription at 1:30pm5:45 arrived at Walgreen's Drive thru was double lanes and each lane had 3 carsCRAP CRAP CRAP my daughter sucks (just got a diagnosis YAAAAAY) and I have to go in Husband says he will go in and I will drive crazy around you are welcome Walmart store and customers Fine I come back to pick him up about 5 minutes later and then wait another 5 minutes No problem we saw the drive thruHusband says: they just pulled up the prescription it will be another 20 minutesWHAT Called in at 1:30pm and still not ready (this is a standard medicine not rocket science)BREATHE ok fine heading to the library down the street we can pick it up on the way homeAn hour later we go back to Walgreen's (I got some great books regarding my daughter's diagnosis btwMy husband comes out and says they just put an over the counter medicine in the bag and made me pay full price for it  $1099 plus taxWTFMy insurance the medicine is covered No out of pocket cost but I deal with the insurance not husband So I get out of the car and go in for my refundLook I hate this store so I'm not spending money in here anymore and I know a shitty box store that sells this medicine for less if I'm going to pay out-of-pocketTHOSE ASSSSSSHoles were LAZY LAZY LAZY and just trying to get rid of a customer's prescription by putting a shelf medicine in an RX bag and charging their customer I explained that my insurance covers the medicine and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket if it's covered he mumbled something about putting the liquid into a bottle and then putting a label on it FU LAZY ASSYou suck Prescription is being filled by another Pharmacy ASSHATs and a nasty gram to the corporateTHIS MEDICINE WAS FOR AN INFANT YOU JERKOFFHappy Halloween Yelpers.
Worst location Terrible service I've been to this location twice and they have no clue what they are doing I ordered a plain cheeseburger and they gave me a hamburger They gave no condiments at all Last time I came here I waited 25 minutes in my car before finally going inside and getting a refund CLEAN It Up Culver's or you'll have seen the last of me I don't care if your foods good or not.
Well what can I say about 1130  Its a great break-up spot great place to wait one hour for a simple pasta dish and a great place to get service that will strangely remind you of that girl in HS that no matter what you did you couldn't get her attentionSeriously though I would not recommend this place  The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance and is inviting  However almost immediately you notice that the waiters don't really seem interested or are not too friendly (mind blowing for a job that is all about hospitality)  A friend of mine didn't want a sauce on her pasta and the waiter didn't acknowledge her when she double checked the order  I flagged him down after he abruptly left so I could make sure the order was correct and his answer was "Yeah I heard her" to which my response was "A reply of receipt would be nice"  The kitchen was also poor on delivery time  The restaurant was more than 3/4 empty and it took a little over an hour to get our food to the table (3 people)  Upon delivery it was obvious that the food had been left on the plate warmer too long or was cooked to the standards of a college cafeteria  The pasta was hardened on the outside and the chicken was WAY overcooked (Pasta Rustica)  Additionally it was evident that the pasta was not drained thoroughly and/or the sauce had something funky going on because there was a nice pool of water on the bottom of the plate  Forget getting a hold of your original waiter  We had to ask two other waiters for service because ours was somewhere in la-la land  Overall this place lacks on service and food quality  I have re-visited restaurants that lack in service but serve great food  This place has neither and will leave you wanting for WAY more.
I received the worst service of my existence at this establishment - absolutely awful  uncaring and embarrassing Our group of 17 arrived at 11am before the rush for a retirement party Shortly thereafter orders were taken and others arrived about 15 minutes later and there orders were taken All were served except me Even those with late orders- my order was nothing special tuna melt  Others who ordered the same received there food completed it and still nothing for me When approached by the manager/ jerk on duty- was told we will get to it  How awful- it makes one not want to attend large luncheons   Pass the word don't go to this establishmentThanks much.
Do not stay here upon walking in to what they call suites you smell dust and this awful musty smell to find very dated layout and kitchen Initially thought it was just me but automatically felt itchy and the room just didn't feel comfortable and clean I even hesitated to walk barefoot in the room because I felt the carpet was dirty and musty The air conditioning is horrible super noisy and super cold - don't even bother What really did it for me was the fact that I found a bug in my sheets something that looked like either bed bug or termite Immediately called front desk packed my things and checked out I was literally in the room for just a couple hoursdon't know how I stayed so long to begin with.
IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there and it tasted like squishy mushy cardboard The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customersThe reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily The coffee is almost bad but the waitresses always look happy[update April 2 2011]Why'd I go back I hate this place now We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast I was excited to do this and was eager I should've stayed homeMy wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold tasted like cardboard and was crunchy The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt crispy and did not look like bacon at allMy sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold I sent it back and complained I think she microwaved my plate Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee She said they had Mocha Vanilla or Hazelnut I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one she said yes and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic)Ok now it's three hours later My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down she would puke SeriouslyThe management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP  They remodeled the outside of this place and I guess spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.
how is this place in business  the only thing good I can say about it is it was soo bad it made us leave and we found an amazing place  no names mentioned but you can read my reviewsservice was non-existant and the place was not well kept at all  We left after one short drink  Too much wrong to listjust skip this one.
Ordered a pizza from this place using grubHub - the pizza was HORRIBLE expensive took forever (longer than GH promised) and arrived COLD Will NEVER order from this place again The pizza was so disgusting that it seemed that they used velveta fake cheese on it it was so bad that we had to trash it.
Quality is awful service is worse.
I love pita hummus Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place What a huge disappointment Dressing was over spiced just burned Pita was bland Glad to see stable something in Town & Country.
I'll most likely be the only 1 star review on here but I don't care  This place looks pretty on the outside but don't be fooled by the glitz and glam of this Biltmore Sushi place  Let me first start with my experience last night I wasn't terribly hungry but I thought I would meet up with some friends and I just ordered a simple Philly Roll  I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon (which comes standard in that roll) so I ask if I could have fresh salmon instead  Placed my order and the server comes back out and lets me know that there would be a $3 up-charge for fresh salmon  No thank you please cancel my order  1 minute later the food runner comes out and says "Here's your roll with fresh salmon" and I told her that I cancelled this order because of the up-charge which she responds back by saying they will send it back  Send it back you mean throw it away  Really  You're really not going to give it to me now you're going to send it back  So the food runner responds that she will ask her manager for permissionNeedless to say I recovered the roll at regular price but I couldn't believe there would be $3 up-charge for fresh salmon  Holy crap way to over charge for the most simple roll SecondDon't go in for lunchthis place has so many flies that you are constantly battling swatting flies away while trying to enjoy your overpriced-mediocre sushi roll  Hopefully with the weather getting cooler the problem has become better BUT never-the-less I just thought you should knowFrom the outside this place looks awesome-on the inside its modern decor will catch your attention-the sushi is not great but its ok-your bill overcharged.
It's a shame that the same staff  "attitude" that one experiences at Windsor has bled through the kitchen and into the ice cream shop This shop could have made a tidy little bundle off of a single retail order for ice cream for 100 people I stopped by to set an appointment to talk with someone about a very large order for a party I was having several days later The young girl behind the counter was completely baffled Nonetheless she spoke with someone who said they would be with me in "a minute" Great I could actually try some of the flavors I was considering for my party A scoop of vanilla and a scoop of blackberry to start I took my IC outside to enjoy After a couple of bites I came across the dreaded hairgag I've been in the hospitality industry for over thirty years and my hardend heart let this one go As I was about to have another bite I saw another hair no wait two no three hairs trapped between the vanilla and blackberry OK this is too much I returned to the counter and gave my IC back to the girl You guessed itbaffled again she was Then she asked if she could get me another serving of the same IC I politely refused AND she never offered to refund my money for the hairy IC experienceThis was 10 minutes into my visit to Churn and still no manager/ice cream maker/whatever came out to meet with me She asked for my contact information and said that the mysterious "someone" would call me The party has come and gone and NO phone call from anyone at Churn They missed a great publicity opportunity and some serious cash from this order Perhaps it's bestdon't think I would want my friends eating a product where shaving cream is more appropriate than whipped cream.
My boyfriend and I were in the area wanted to try something new scoped it out on YELP Thought it would be good because the reviews were good Only one menu off to the side in the whole place One girl was working no greeting went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way was tossing things around must have hated her job Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted Absolutely would not come here again The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back The food was decent had a salad and nothing to write home about You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food.
Our first time here was not a a good experience food was very salty had very little chicken in our chicken dishes and had to keep swatting away flies from our food We will not be returning.
I'll start by saying that I can enjoy some chain bars I actually really like Dave and Busters as their prices are decent and they have a reverse happy hour Bar Louie is no Dave and Busters though One star and there's a lot of reasons why To begin with there was a wait to get our menus from our server This is a minor hassle and I can understand how this can happen when everyone is new but I feel like an experienced manager with a staff of experienced servers can tackle this issue right from the opening dateBar Louie does not list their drink prices except for wine This is a huge pain If it was just a bar it would be a little more acceptable but for a restaurant menu to not have drink prices is inconsiderate I settled on a Manhattan which was on the specialty drink menu It was good but forgettable I actually had a way better Manhattan at Hanny's that was made with rye and was a lot less Like most corporate bars I have my doubts as to how knowledgeable the bartenders really are The food was very very sub-par and forgettable The one thing they have going is good happy hour prices and on Tuesdays they have $5 burgers I ordered the Backyard BBQ burger which comes with BBQ sauce and onion rings It was just ok nothing memorable and I actually like the ones at Red Robin better (those come with unlimited fries) The boo and I got the pretzel appetizer and this was really lousy Eight bucks for four pretzel sticks fresh out of the microwave served with crappy honey mustard average queso and tasty cinnamon sugar spread You should get more than four sticks when you're paying that much The boo got the Mac and Cheese with chicken AVOID THIS It was basically Velveeta shells and cheese with a couple of pieces of grilled chicken hidden away Flavorless and dull if you're going to do Mac and Cheese at least bake it and make it memorable The real killer was my last drink I thought my Manhattan was a little weak so I ordered an Old Fashioned with Jim Beam Big mistake I received the weakest drink I've ever been served It was literally clear with barely any bourbon The server asked how it was and being the nice guy I am I just nodded and said it was good I should've found the manager and requested another drink This mishap has ruined Bar Louie for me I will go anywhere else for drinks at Tempe MarketplaceThe bill came and I saw that all the martini drinks were $10 a pop Hanny's charges five bucks for an excellent martini made with gin and filled to the brim That price is absurd for what you're getting and to top it off it was seven bucks for a Jim Beam old-fashioned Skip this corporate cookie cutter bar you will not enjoy it If you can check out Four Peaks (excellent prices food and drinks) or Casey Moore's (same as Four Peaks) Hell go to Dave and Busters before you come here they at least have reverse happy hour I really really wanted to like Bar Louie I love the idea of having drinks before a flick but this place clearly doesn't have their act together.
He make me a Crown that I don't Need it Screwed my teeth The Insurance says that Is not enough proof for do a Crown I said I will not paid for something that the Insurance said is was right Finally now I found a very good dentist he is trying to fix it but I need to replace it because I was allergic to metal things that Dr Payne never ask before Now I have to paid extra 1300$ because a New crown and Insurance not cover crown if is less that 5 years and maybe I need a Root Canal too so extra money too Thanks Dr Payne I want to send you the bill.
I'm very sure that I will never purchase from this company ever again The following is not the only issue with my purchase however it is the most pressing It's been a month since my return of a mattress that was never even delivered to my home and they have had unknown problem after problem processing my return which has stalled the return of my moneyFirst the Ahwatukee Store Manager stopped taking my calls Mike was great when I was purcahsing but had Clare speak to me whenever I followed up on my return  claiming that corporate was processing it Then when I called the customer service line the guy brought me to tears Between having no information on a month old return claiming that a Tempur-Pedic base has no warranty and refusing to let me speak to a manager I felt completely de-humanized and powerless As if I would never again see my [significant amount] of moneyAfter harnessing my Google-fuu I found corporate accounts payable who admitted my return had never even been addressed (over a month later) let alone processed and she would bring it to a manager and I'd receive a call in 24hrs No call I just spoke with them only to find out still nothing has been done The only things I can do is call and start speaking up about this unprofessional treatment I feel completely powerless while they sit on my money the Store Manager has his commission and I have nothing But if this continues I will have to look into further and more serious appropriate legal action How do you file a collections claim on a corporation.
We ate at Chompie's in Scottsdale last night Table of four It may have been the worst dining experience of my life The food came to the table an hour after it was ordered and only after we appealed to the manager Of course the orders were wrong and ice cold The check was wrong the first time and all four times that it was redone I was only going to pay what I thought I owed anyway but then the manager tore up the check and said the meal was on him The food Tasteless pastrami that was 50% fat The corned beef was higher quality But in a blind taste test I would have guessed Irish pub not "NY kosher style deli" This is "New York Deli" God forbid.
This place is a joke I have reported to our insurance company for fraud They billed us for lenses we didn't get and also charged our insurance company for a contact lens fitting we paid out of pocket for Save yourself the time and hassle I've been working with our insurance company to get this rectified but honestly what a mess  I will say the exam was thorough but it did take a long time (4+ hours for two of us) It's safe to say we'll be staying far far away from this place.
Horrible service  Walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait Sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after I did Walked up and the hostess She said sorry you're next The service sucks here Night was ruined before I got my food.
I fly a lot on business out of PHX  Mostly to TX and CA  I only fly US Air when I absolutely have to usually to destinations in CA SJV Valley  They used to be pretty good when they were America West  After the US Air merger I've noticed a deterioration in flight service and customer care  My colleagues have dubbed it "U Suck Airways"Hopefully they will get better after a merger/buyout of American but if history is a guide they probably won't  All the poor reviews in these postings are true uncomfortable seats mechanical problems costly change fees etcThe only good thing  Their fares are still pretty cheap  I guess you get what you pay forI had over 100k miles with US Air at one point now I'm a Southwest convert  Once you learn Southwest's boarding system it's a breeze  Definitely a better airline than US Air.
I live in South Scottsdale My boyfriend and I are always in tempe and we would shop at this whole foods we loved the service there until last year we got kicked out of the store for no reason by the store manager claiming we vandalize his property yet he wouldnt show us anything on the video tapehe said he would call the cops on us if we came back for trespassing no such agreement between us the store and the cops when we did nothing wrong i want this issue to be resolved but i wouldnt shop there until they got a new store manager if anyone can help us out on being kicked out for no reason and what 2 do plz email me My boyfriend and I were kicked out last july for something that we still don't know what we did we made a complaint to the HR in texas they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now I believed it was eric but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store.
I had the worst sushi roll (salmon skin roll) in my life here It was burnt other rolls and sashimi are medocre at best Mido and kabuki are way better than this place.
when you walk in the door the color scheme is a lot like jamba juice but they got half way there and stopped  so it is left looking less like a healthfood/smoothie place and more like a commercial doctors office  you have to ask what is in each smoothie as the ingredients are nowhere to be found  I was hoping to see sugar and calorie counts  a large smoothie seems half the size of jambas and cost a lot more  there is a window where you can see the workers in back all having a good time and barely working on your order and I was told the owner was there  the tropical smoothie I got was so so  wont be back.
I tried this place again and just as I thought It still hasn't updated it's taste in food at all It was like I was there the first time all over again I'm sorry to say but it's unenjoyable and gave me a tummy ache Ordered the volcano roll I think and it was torched It had a nasty gas burned flavor that wasnt good I don't appreciate that And I could see stack and stacks of already cooked tempura in the kitchen in the side It's cooked but not cooked fresh when you ordered It's a waste of money even though its cheap Won't be going here ever ever again.
At least American Junkie is honest By including the word "junkie" in their title they let you know up front that they are a manifestation of the word Also spelled as "junky" this adjective can be defined as - "having the quality (or being like) junk cheap or of low quality" - and it perfectly describes everything about this placeThe laughably long line of people waiting to get in on a Fri/Sat night JunkyThe bouncers Unbelievably JunkyThe patrons you meet once you finally get inside the bar JunkyThe food JunkyThe too crowded bar area JunkyThe wait to get one measly drink JunkyThe service JunkyThe wait staff that is more concerned about their looks than their tables JunkyThe dance floor filled with d-bags and wannabes JunkyUnfortunately I've been here more than once (not voluntarily as once was more than enough) and I always have a junky time I don't like to waste my time doing junky things as Scottsdale has so much more to offer and I also don't like buying junky things Basically it comes down to the fact that I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars at a place that continually promotes a junky atmosphere and junky customer service.
Way to over priced Went for happy hour and left not so happy with how much the drinks are The whole place was also emptyI think I know why.
BANG BANG BANG on our door at 4 am by the front desk clerk  Why Ok let's start at the beginning  Phoenix has an overabundance of budget adequate chain motel/hotel rooms and we figured this was one of them  When we arrived the day before Thanksgiving 2011 we found a full-on construction site so much so that we could NOT find the way INTO the hotel  Eventually a workman snaked our way though to an incomplete lobby and we went up to our room  AT FIRST LOOK this newly redecorated room looked and smelled clean and even had a somewhat upscale interior design for a budget motel (This Ramada is becoming a Holiday Inn we were told)  But it was downhill after that  The water was turned off and we did not have water until three hours after we arrived  We turned on the air conditioner because it was in the 80's and the window does not open WELL we might as well have been in an airplane test hangar because it is SO unrelentingly LOUD that you cannot hear the TVat alland I have great hearing  We eventually realized that the Air Conditioner / Heat Pump individual unit while there IS a wall thermostat only has ONE setting andit is HIGH (Lo and Med still blast at HIGH intensity)  Little by little the fault became apparent to usthis was a cosmetic touchup but the important things were missing likea BATH TUBthere is no tub just a shower with a shower head that barely yields a dribble of waterthe TV is an old TUBE TV and it is blurry and scrambled and two calls to the desk (no one answers the extensions) brought no results  Speaking of the bathroom there is no window no fan and an ill-fitting toilet seat that shifts loudly to one side each time you "alight"  Many have complained about their odd shoji pocket door to the bathroom which bounces back open and clipped my husband's hand twice As others have mentioned there are paperthin walls APPARENTLY because we woke up at 4 am to watch the news  We are very conscious as we live in a condo to keep our TV down  Nonetheless with this HORRENDOUSLY loud wall unit air conditioner if you want to hear the TV you have to turn it up and we did NOT turn it up as much as we would like to butBANG BANG BANG on our door a few minutes after we had gotten up   The Front Desk Clerk rudely said when I opened the door (which is freaky at 4 am) -"The neighbors complained about the noise and I could hear it all the way down the hall" - **Note to Manager: GOOD LUCK RAMADA/HOLIDAY INN when it is 110 degrees outside and people have their TV's up much louder than we did to combat the a/c on UNRELENTING HIGH  Trust me there will be multiple complaints every night  Other reviews of this motel have mentioned the same complaints  I was planning on telling the desk clerk when we checked out after 3 nights about some of these "constructive ideas" for their own benefit  However the checkout clerk looked like he was NOT open to  input (probably overdosed on complaints) so I refrained  Basically the owners have cheaped out on this major remodel   If you read this Ramada/Holiday Inn Manager at the very least you need to get an electrician to REWIRE the thermostat to get a  LOW FAN setting on the a/c wall unit buy new TVs replace the toilet seat change out the bathroom shoji door and shoot some insulation into the walls  And we're just not all that picky.
I've never had a great experience at Macaroni Grill but decided to try it again since I heard their menu had changed  The menu may have changed but that's all that's changed  We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables  I looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses in the entire restaurantI ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it  Why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone's food  Well apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor  None at all  I have had alfredo pasta at fast food Italian places and it's been better than this  My husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken  The best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husband's chicken  They were really good  Overall it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and $45  I will never go back againOh and PS  Who serves water in gross bottles with NO ICE  Yuck.
Very disappointing and expensive  We went there on Sunday and didn't realize our only choice was the Sunday Super menu for $35 That is way too much for fried chicken especially when 2 of 3 pieces are wings I've had better at KFC The menu on their website was also different than the one we got in the restaurant Had I known we couldn't  choose from the regular menu I would have gone on a different day.
I have been a patron of Eggingtons for over 20 years I have nothing bad to say about the food itself it's amazing and wonderful and I'll still come back despite this review However that being said a patron who has been coming for 20+ years should have been treated in a much more professional manner I made a reservation 2 MONTHS in advance of the Saturday before mother's day to have a Bridal Shower Bruncheon for my Sister-in-law Yes it was a large party yes it was the Saturday BEFORE Mother's Dayall of which was irrelevant because if this was going to be a problem you should NOT have taken the reservation for me in the first place Most restaurants I go to that I've made reservations for usually have the table ready for me when I get there which I assumed would be the case as I had requested it be ready a few moments ahead of 11:30 so I could set up the cupcakes games etc I arrived at 10:55 to be sure that everything was in place and to drop off the cupcakes so they wouldn't melt The hostess took the cupcakes and my name and said the table wasn't ready yet so I went to run a last minute errand and came back at 11:20 To my chagrin not only was my table STILL not ready another party was still occupying it which I was told only after waiting for another 10 minutes with balloons favors and gifts in the lobby when I finally went up and asked what had happened with the reservation  The hostess basically had no response other than that it "wasn't quite 11:30 yet" and that the bills were being taken up I glanced over to where she had just looked and saw that the people were literally still eating Another party of 15 people were not even close to being done so it was close to noon before we were seated  After finally getting settled there were no further issues but it just wasn't what I'd had in my mind I'd wanted everything all set up and pretty for everyone's arrival and there was no apology for the miscommunication on Eggington's sideIt may not sound like it from this review but I'm actually a pretty reasonable person If something like this happens I get it it's an accident but don't make me stand there with a group of 15 people and feel like the dummy when it wasn't my fault either Bring out some muffins find another place to move us out of the way continue to apologize for the mistake and bring me some free whatever-the-bride-to-be's-favorite-drinks are (raspberry mochas) when we're finally seated It's really a lot easier to alleviate these issues than it seems unfortunately management doesn't seem to take this approach the majority of the time.
Should refinancing take many months a 50000 good faith payment constant emails and calls and just plain hounding us  I have never had this experience before with my first mortgage I am very disappointed with quicken loans and the way they conduct business.
I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me The chips and salsa were good but not great The rice and beans were blah The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking " Dammit Arik B was right".
I chose this motel because it is 3 blocks from downtown I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a "party" motel And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $15000 cleaning deposit if we smoked Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke LoL  And nobody in my family smokes I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said "Well looks like we came to the right place honey"'I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black Old gum some kind of splash stains trash all in view on the way to the room  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation We went back and hung out in our other room DISGUSTING The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint dust and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex Seriously  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom Gross I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised I went back to the front office for some coffee The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room And that it had aired out pretty good I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them and the condition of the room I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go  So I did I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues Later that night after two of my kids showered their tub (in room 108 the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain I walked back to the front office and met the lady again She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already I now asked for a new room She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room I never heard back from them the entire stay Not to see if we were ok Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)  The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast Ok at least they are trying I guess But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people We will never stay her again And I feel like we should get a partial refund I understand things happen But this place is a joke I would be embarrassed to work here And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on Just hard to believe people can just not careUPDATED JANUARY 26TH    After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites  Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house They did end up going away and have not returned since.
Overrun and understaffed Poor training of cashiers Glass barriers behind espresso machines are super messy Cashier tried to give me Pike when I asked for dark I said "is this dark roast" She said "yes" I said "isn't it pike" "Yes our dark roast" she said I had to inform her that Pike was NOT Their dark.
Looks like I'm one of the few guests who wasn't "dazzled" by this resort which I suppose is a good thingWe stayed there for just one night (thankfully) in early summer and I can definitely say it will be the last time The rooms were halfway decent but only somewhat better than a $39 Howard Johnson There were so many coats of paint on the wall the doors didn't close properly and my room had an unrestricted view of the parking lot even though we'd specifically requested (and were promised) a room overlooking the pool area As I've come to expect from high-dollar low value hotels this place wanted to nickel and dime me to death I mean seriously they charged $6 for a $099 bottle of water and then if that wasn't insulting enough in very small print revealed a $2 "Restocking" fee whatever the hell that is so all in all you were afforded the opportunity to spend $8 on a lousy bottle of water Oh and then there was the wireless internet You know the same internet that is free at Marriotts Hiltons and other reputable hotels No at this dive they wanted $1995 per day for the privilege of using the internet If you wanted to use the business center they'd only charge you $10 for 10 minutes How generous of themIn hindsight tho it's probably a good thing we didn't have a pool view because the pool area was disgusting There was trash and sand all over the place the pools were filthy and cloudy and smelled of urine and half of the poolside furniture was broken All this can be yours for the bargain basement price of $129 per night IN THE SUMMERNever again.
Stopped by on a Sunday to try the place out Ordered the shrimp app which was overcooked chewy and tasteless The other two chicken dishes were the same Will probably not try this place again.
I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS PLACE AGAIN IF IT'S THE LAST EATERY ON EARTH FOR A MEALBagels were ok but the attitude and reception from the owner is a MINUS (-5) but that grading is not possible but definitely warranted for this Owner and her establishmentI live in the Estrella Mountains and only minutes from this place so the wife and I frequented the store for weeks hoping to patronize local eateries and establishments And one thing became very apparent each and every time we went therethe owner of the establishment completely ignored us At first my wife and I thought maybe she was busy and didn't notice us but being such a small place you get to know everyone relatively quickly ESPECIALLY if they frequent your business each and every weekend  So we decided to say hello to her on one of our weekly Saturday visit to and see if we read it incorrectly and give her the benefit of the doubt but sure enough she never acknowledged us at all  Not even a smile  But it gets worse she walked passed us to greet another customer sitting next to us that arrived after we were seated So I looked at my wife and said "it couldn't be because we are a interracial couple huh"  Oh maybe we were invisible or covered in manure It just had to be something we ourselves could not see or notice ourselves  I really didn't get itSo we went a few more times because this just couldn't be the case in the 21st Century with a Black President  Heck No  Sure enough a few more Saturdays passed and not even a look in our direction  I truly wish I could express how I feel about such people but I want this message be read and the message get out that this is our discovery dealing with this store never to spend another dime with them again  RIP.
I am very embarrassed I ate here So much so I didn't even photograph because anyone would think this was just a hate review I will start with my iced TeaI went to the iced tea dispenser and got splashed in the belly with cold iced tea The manager just laughed when she saw saw iced tea hit me in the stomach  but she did wipe it off the floor (yeah)I thought the packaged salsa looked better than the salsa bar salsa because the salsa bar salsa looked like it was just frozen tomatoes just brought outThe  chicken in my salad was so dry I don't think anybody body would come back for trying chicken here (In the salad anyway)And the tomatoes seemed like thawed  grainy frozen tomatoes and the dressing was just Mayo with a little green stuff in itIt was very bad foodsorry.
Closed rip  Available sign.
The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed I broke my leg 8 weeks ago and it was hard for me to maneuver through all the rock and plug in wires In two hours I was only able to three trucks beetit torched goddess and a barbecue truck The creme brûlée was amazing but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting Good Concept though.
Today I called the office about my AC It wasn't working at all And it took them 5hrs to respond But they just came and fixed the AC but they didn't changed the filters So I called the office for some filters and the management told me they ran out of it but I have to get my own Not so good And last week our bathroom was flooded and they didn't know where the water came from However if your rent is short for only 23cents they will charged you a $100 after a week All I can say is the management don't know how to treat people DO NOT MOVE HERE.
The scheduling woman Annette is extremely rude and unapologetic  When scheduling a time to come in to my home for an appointment they did not provide the 30 minute call ahead they said they would  She then called to reprimand me for not being there and said that I was being irresponsible  I tried to let her know that I did not receive the 30 minute prior phone call even letting me know that the technician was going to be there  She told me I was wrong and refused to believe me  While the technician's service was neutral the scheduling woman was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.
I won't get into the quality of the food or anything else after the experience I had the FIRST time I went here I had just moved in to the neighborhood right around the corner no less It was the first place my family and I thought we would try in the area We each ordered a slice of pepperoni and a soda Their sodas come from a fountain but you don't get to fill it yourself I get my soda and sip it It's foul Something is definitely wrong with their machine It wasn't the normal issue that fountains have of distributing too much soda water in relation to the syrup This was different It was much worse The soda had a strong chemical taste to it and was not sweet I go back to the counter and ask for another one explaining that there was something seriously wrong with the one I got The guy looks at me like I'm speaking Chinese and then asks me to wait while he gets his superior He brings back the owner and I explain to her what is going on and ask for a replacement She flat out says "No" I am taken aback Confused I think she must not understand the situation I explain again "No I can't" is her response I ask her to taste the soda because the only explanation I can come up with is that she doesn't believe me She refuses to taste itI have never experienced anything like this in my life First off we all know that these sodas cost about 10 cents to the proprietor That is why most restaurants let you fill your own But what is really upsetting is that this goes beyond bad customer service I did not receive a soda That's how "off" it was Yet I paid for it I was ripped off over a soda that costs them 10 cents After eating my slice (I had already paid for it) I walked out of the place vowing never to return It's too bad as the pizza is decent and the place is only 2 minutes from my house.
Not with it.
I went to Z PIzza out of convenience It is within walking distance from the ER and the person who was in the ER was irrationally hungry At 6:30 on Sunday night I walked to Z Pizza to get 4 slices of pizza because it was faster than ordering a full pizza The slices were awful They were old They cost $13 They were only barely warmed in the pizza oven If you don't see the pizzas come out of the oven then don't expect them to be good Lesson learned.
I don't even want to give one star--is there a zero star optionWe have eaten at this Mellow Mushroom at least 10 times since they have opened and but service has always been mediocre  One of the reasons that we kept coming back is because we kept getting manager comped meals due to a variety of issues this location had  Tonight we went in for drinks and reverse happy hour after a birthday party at the establishment next door  There was a group of 20 of us there and after eating a full meal and sitting there for 2 hours- I had drank ONE drink when I went to order another drink was told that our entire party was cut off from drinks  Excuse me When I asked why exactly that was the bartender/manager on duty sarcastically and rudely said "would you like me to call you a cab home" and walked away  With zero explanation and a cocky bartender on his high horse thank you very much but I will never come back to this establishment again  At 11:30 at night on a Friday night I am not sure what sort of crowd you are expecting but I do not expect to be cut off after one drink This place promotes their variety of beers on tap and is a BAR  The service is horrible and if you want drinks/food there are plenty of other choice in the area do do not go to the City North Mellow Mushroom I highly recommend Modern Margarita or Kona Grill right next door.
If you like food that reminds you of your 4th grade meal from elementary school then this is the place I hate to give it one star I really do because it seems like a small family business and our waitress was such a sweetheart BUT the food was awful If you like Greek salads be prepared to mix your own dressing with it It does not come mixed with the dressing If you like kalmata olives that you would get on a Greek salad ANYWHERE else be prepared because the olives on this salad are not kalmata The only thing that makes this salad "Greek" is the feta Other than that there is nothing special about it Their little bread on the side took me back to 4th grade elementary school where we got little buns on the side of our plates for lunch The spaghetti had a little bit of marinara sauce Wasn't even enough And which for being "homemade" had a very 'out-of-the-can' taste There was absolutely nothing special about this place Overpriced I guess if you are there on a hot summer day and your kids are playing in the water and get hungry than they would probably like the pizzas by the slice I saw them offer but for a dinner I highly recommend you go to Gramaldis down the street But the people are SUPER nice I would give this place another try if I saw major improvement and who knows maybe I will since I believe it recently opened up :).
I heard so many good thing about GB so I took a group of friends to work our way through all the offerings Between the seven of us we ordered everything that came around Some of it was out of this world and we desperately tried to remember which cart had what we liked so we could order more The best was better than anything I've had in San Francisco or New YorkToo many of the plates were terrible Some because they had been steaming or sitting too long or reheated too many times and a few because the ingredients were absolutely the very cheapest I've seen outside a school cafeteria About half of the plates were just inedible Effectively this doubled the price of the meal and soured us to the dishes we should have savored I won't go back unless it's with someone who knows which chef is working.
I totally dislike this candy store to begaig with i went to this place 5 minutes before they close and the open sign wasn on  They said its close come back tomorrow at 9am I went next day at 9am but it was still close never open waited there for 30 minutes and  I went to another candy store the name is Mayra's the lady was very helpful and nice and thanks for letting me express my self.
Pros : clean placeCons: lots The service was horrible especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24 And when you get bad service for spending so much that would drive me crazy Drinks and food were ok Not the quality I expected There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far betterIn short I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives.
At YC's Mongolian BBQ I can put as much rice or noodles as I'd like in my bowlAt Genghis Grill my meal only comes up 1/2 a cup of riceAt YC's Mongolian BBQ I mix my own sauces into my meat and noodles and put as much as I'd like in my bowlAt Genghis Grill I get yelled at for not following instructions and not putting my sauce into a cupAt YC's Mongolian BBQ I pay at the front get my bowl and go through the line and seat myselfAt Genghis Grill I get seated at a table curiously wonder if my purse will be stolen while I'm going through the line and later given a check prompting me to tip someone who only served me a drinkAt YC's Mongolian BBQ the vegetables all look crisp at the station and the rice is warm and steamyAt Genghis Grill the vegetables are watery as if they came from 99c cans at the supermarket and the rice is hard/stale when it comes served in my bowlAt YC's Mongolian BBQ I get complimentary soup/rice/drink/yogurt with my dinner purchaseAt Genghis Grill I get a big headache and wonder why I didn't just drive down to YC's.
Ok I do not understand the cult following that this place has I grew up in Mesa and have been dragged to this place several times only to wonder "WHY" The food is ridiculously hot - not yummy hot - just hot I like hot food but I want food that is delicious and digestable The service sucks and the prices are a rip off.
This is a bad StarbucksIn 15 years of drinking Starbucks in hundreds of locations in as many cities I have not found a worse run Starbucks consistentlyMy office is near and I have resorted to going out of my way to get my Starbucks at a different location  Unfreindly inefficient unqualified and just horribly managedAmateur employees who play grab @ss with the others while they are serving you the wrong order while the line is dozens deep is frustrating  Dirty condiment stations ALWAYS and usually out of something until you tell them  If it were one or two experiences I would never write the bad review but it is every time  So frustratingI have written Starbucks corporate several times they have acknolwledged the problem but obviously done anything to fix it  It is a shame and a black mark on a good corporation.
Star CarWash definitely has better drying system My front and back windows with really bad job when you buy ANY of the washes Good vacuums hoses Good and nice shade for you to dry your car There is a tiny tiny zinc to wash your hands I guess They sell microfiber rag for $2 because this place doesn't include a rag with any of your washes Over all I recommend to go to StarWash cCar Wash if you are picky and just drive away with out drying your car yourself CLEANFREAK you must get off and dry the windows yourself I would love to see a place where you can wash your mats with a hose and brush This place offers wonderful monthly packages but their poor job didn't convince me to get on They have packs for $358 bucks Get the $5 cause $8 pack doesn't seem to have any difference I bought one at Star CarWash but expired and I was very pleased Employees here are very helpful and professional For an emergency this place is ok.
I have just purchased a sectional sofa from here for our family room they offered us next day delivery which I thought at the time was great being that it was just before the Christmas Holliday Well everything looked great until I really had a chance to spend time looking at it on my first day off which was 5 days later and I noticed two strange faded like spots one on the back of the sofa which is covered by the throw pillows and the other by where the fold of your legs would hit At first I thought it was just the sun making a shadowing effect but I was wrong We called the room store customer service and they sent someone out 5 days later and then they followed up with a call telling us it was normal wear REALLY I didn't even have it for a week The sale person was the manager at the store his name was jack although he was polite they DO NOT  Stand behind there furniture I would never shop buy or tell anyone to buy or even look at anything in this store ever They are very unprofessional when it comes to standing behind there product Very unhappy Jacque.
Staff were completely uninterested Bread was kinda soggy (on the outside) like it was close to something steaming and one of the cucumbers were moldy/rotten Won't be going back EVER.
This target SUCKS I went shopping spent over 400 bucks and some of my stuff was not in the bag when I got home had to come back waited well over 15 minutes to get my stuff back a rent a cop is taking for ever to approve me getting my stuff.
$16-18 per plate for a tapas style 2 bite plate The food was average at bestHorrible serviceUnnecessarily pretentious employees$12 drinksDid I mention how bad the service wasPASS.
worst brunch on 10/31 i have ever had ordered eggs benedict with salmon for 18 dollars and received eggs totally uncooked  with canadian bacon bought to their attention and 20 minutes later received eggs benedict with cold salmon on an non toasted cold muffin ugh.
BUYER BEWARE  After having this company out to my home to repair a garage door (which due to lack of communication within the company resulted unnecessarily in multiple visits from different technicians to my homeeach technician providing us with different information than the prior as to the extent of repair necessary) we discovered that 3 tactical weapon knives were suddenly missing after the final technician's visit  We immediately notified the business owner  After multiple phone calls to the owner he finally responded that "you have no proof or evidence that my guys took them"  I notified the owner that I am filing a formal (under perjury of law) police report about this incident and filing complaints with all relevant licensing/consumer agencies BUYER BEWARE.
Took a couple of jeans to get hemmed here   The work was shoddy because they used standard thread not heavy duty thread  Also they didn't account for the spandex in the jeans so the stitching came out all baggy and loose  Nice couple but unfortunately I don't think they do good work for the price.
This is the worst frozen yogurt place I've ever been toFirst when I first went last summer they were pretty new  I thought that was why it was so plain inside  They also didn't have much to offer  The frozen yogurt was too tart and then only offered 2 or 3 flavors--none of which I liked  There was a plain flavor (ick) mango and maybe peach or something else strange  And they put the toppings on themselves  They barely put anything on there  Definitely not worth the costOh  And because they were new their website was pretty plain and boring  However I must add that it had soooo many grammatical errors  So unprofessional  And I see now that their website has nothing on it  How can you have a business in 2009 and not have a websiteI've been in since then and it still is just as bad as then  The yogurt is disgusting and I would never go here again  It's disappointing because I don't have any other frozen yogurt places near my house.
It was my birthday and I went here with my family We were seated and waited about 10 minutes A server told us she would be right with us We waited about another 10 minutes She brought bread to the table didn't say a word and left us again She didn't bring us water drinks or take our order After waiting about 25 minutes we got up and left We go to this Cheesecake factory a few times a month and usually have good service but because of this service it is highly unlikely we will ever return There were many other servers that we could see were not busy and not one of them came up when they could clearly see we had been waiting a long time We then went across the street and received great service from True Food as expected Extremely disappointed in our experience at the Cheesecake Factory.
Do not go here for fingerprint services I went to this location to have my fingerprints done for a fingerprint clearance card for school This store advertised this service for $20 so I chose this store to have my fingerprints done When I arrived at the store and told the clerk what I needed she handed me a small square ink pad and told me to roll my fingers on the ink pad and then on the paper She then charged me $20 and I was on my way I know nothing about fingerprinting I assumed they did 3 weeks later my card was returned to me because of the poor job I did Well big surprise I lost critical time for this time sensitve document Who advertises this service but does not actually provide the CORRECT service I went to the police department to have this done and it came out much darker and clearer and was obviously done properly by a trained professional Please stop offering this service since you are not trained on how to do fingerprintsI called the store to let them know of the situation and the clerk seemed way too busy to really listen to me didn't seem like he cared much and told me to bring my receipt in and have it redone Oh yeah that's what I want to do lose another 3 weeks of time on my time sensitive document Not a happy camper over here with this store.
Terrible  Way overpriced worse than it's nearby competitors in every measurable way.
So I go into this walmart (on Thomas) at 8:30 last night I am always reluctant to use a cart or basket for fear of what I'll catch so when I do I always grab a few cleaning towels and wipe down the object of contagion None there The lady who was greeting people while sitting down turned away as I was fumbling among the empty containers I gave up: I was probably already infected I shopped gawked at the patrons asked a couple of employees questions that they couldn't comprehend and left about $2000 lighter  As I was walking back to my car I watched a woman who had changed her child's diaper in the back of her van look both ways and toss it under her car  I drove to the IHOP a few blocks away and washed up relieved to know that I might now survive waltonitis I carefully wiped down anything I had touched and have finally decided that I will NEVER shop at walmart again I can do without dangerous uncivilized behaviorZERO STARS FOR THIS DUMP.
food was great but the service i received was not so great which made me just lose my appetite all together our server was really really rude had an attitude and got orders wrong slammed our plates on the table almost spilled one of the drinks because of this stinky ass attitude he had i was really irate i would like to go to my favorite restaurant (which might not be my fave anymore because of this experience) and enjoy myself because of this man's attitude i gave him a $3 tip (should have gave him nothing at all) the server got mad about the $3 tip and came up to us as we left with an attitude again being sarcastic saying "i hope that didnt break your pocketttssss" waving his hand as he said "pockettttsss" ungrateful ass  im done with this red lobster i rather drive an extra 10 miles to another location.
Poor service incredibly slow ticket times two order mess-ups and a FREEZING cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience  Took thirty minutes for our app to come out  Had to ask for lemons for our tea three times before the waitress remembered to bring them out  When our lunch entrees arrived my friend's bacon cheeseburger which she ordered with Swiss cheese (she originally wanted American which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server) was topped with cheddar instead  She decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet (gross)  That got sent back  My other friend's food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error  I had the balsalmic dressing with my salad and I highly suggest you stay away from thattastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns  And wear a sweater  AZ is hot and all but that doesn't mean the AC needs to be turned down to 40*.
Blech How can you mess up a turkey dog I could've nuked mine at home and it would've tasted better than this I won't be back Also I ordered a meal in the drive through and they forgot the fries.
I was very upset not with the quality of food but with the quality of management I witnessed a manager say inappropriate things about a young girl and spoke about Wetzels and how they determine who works there I'm sorry - but if she bought a pretzel and asked for an app there's no excuse for rude behavior Also before you make snide remarks about customers you should realize that customers pay your measly salary Auntie Anns from now on.
Well I used to come here all the time until I came with my kids  Since they don't have a kids menu I would of thought that the waitress would split a reg breakfast for my two little ones since she told me that she would figure something out for them She came out with three big size plates my kids are 37  What bothered me is the check was $4700 and that ruined my day with them I couldn't afford to do anything else I will not be coming back instead I go to black bear diner now their prizes are great and the food I can say is better than the farmhouse.
The place is a joke  It thinks it's about 5-6 miles south in old town but forgets that it shares a parking lot with Safeway and a bunch of other stores  This was the first time (and hopefully the last) I paid $10 cover and $10 a drink while parking next to a shopping cart returnThey make a feeble attempt to prop the lace up as a destination but once you're inside you tend to wonder why there's a dress code  Are they really that offended by toesThankfully there are several places nearby that are more fun- with no cover no less- so location saves it  You can have far more fun at Sand Bar Ernie's Tapino and Dirty Dogg.
First of all if you go here PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes  honestly  We went here 3 times  all 3 times we were over charged  either the menu's were out of date or we were "past happy hour time" (BS) oh and the other excuse we just changed our menu  blah blah blah  Pthen they always have to "get a manager" to come to the table which takes forever  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS  this is a definitely bait and switch1st time it happened we just dealt with it and was like whatever2nd time it happened my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like whatever3rd time  took a friend there  again we ordered devils ale  on the menu it was listed at one price when we got the bill it was almost twice as much  We waited for our server to come back she never did she totally ignored us  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me i tip very well too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip  If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun  We much prefer there we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again  They say 3rd time is a charm Well it is its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crapoh and if i didn't have to give a star i wouldn't have.
We had absolutely terrible experiences with this company We called many times leaving messages because no one answers the phone -- EVER After an extended phone tag we finally reached them For example it took over 2 weeks to get a phone call from the owner They don't even ask your name they file everything by "your cross streets" I agree with the other reviewer - this fellow is in way over his head Anyway we finally had one scheduled and then the cleaner calls and wants to bring a 2-yr old child along for the three or four hours she would be in our home How unprofessional this outfit is - stay away.
They were out of everything I wanted to order and I was getting frustrated and I could tell the cashier was as well-she seemed to get a bit irritated I would go often if they had everything I wanted on hand Seriously-they were out of hemp seed (thats one on the list) how is that possible Lol.
Bad food BAD serviceI ordered Cheeseburger Sliders and Tots The sliders were a joke and the tots tasted like they were fried in very old oil While I was chatting with my friends and waiting for the food our server came over and slammed my plate down in front of me which actually scared me and made me jump Later on I asked for hot sauce and when she brought it over she of course walked by quickly (without any eye contact) and also slammed it on the table Everything she said to us was lazy slurred and unclear On multiple occasions we would have to ask each other "What did she say" It was clear that she didn't want to be there There is no reason for that bad attitude especially since we did nothing that could have annoyed herTrust the negative reviews Don't go here.
Save yourself and try somewhere else The taco and relleno plate was just horrible A mush of egg and bad cheese Taco was dripping oil  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better  Bland tomato sauce  There is better food out there.
Had a horrible experience there tonight  To put this in perspective I rarely say that about any restaurant   We had a Groupon and went based on good reviews on this site  Four of us went to dinner there- Three of us ordered glasses of red wine  Wine was warm in all three glasses and had rather skimpy pours  The bottle we ordered later was good temperature though- Ordered Bruschetta and the Cheese plate  They made a mistake on the order  No big deal and sent back the order  However 30 seconds later someone other than our server (the manager) brought us the very same plate we just sent back  Sent that back  30 seconds later the waiter shows up and proceeds to tell us what we ordered-- which he had wrong  Once we got the right order they were good (although-- the bruschetta bread was not toasted all that well)- Egg Plant Lasagna Short Ribs and Margherita Flat bread were good- I ordered the prosciutto copa and brie sandwich which was listed under the WOOD FIRED SANDWICHES  I got a cold sandwich with mediocre bread Yes I should have sent it back and would have if either the manager or our waiter would have showed up at some point after bringing us our orders By the way the place was mostly empty at this point- As noted above we had a Groupon with a value of approx $175 which included 4 drinks 2 appetizers 4 "entrees" and 1 dessert  We had those and ordered a bottle of wine on top of that bringing the bill to approx $181 w/out subtracting the value of  the Groupon   Waiter brings the bill which should have been approx $6 (after subtracting the Groupon value)  We explained several times to him that it should be approx $6 not $181  Our guests were going to cover the difference plus the tip on their credit card  What charge comes back  You guessed it $181  Even after correcting the mistake it was approx $15 (assume the diff was taxes)  - "Free" valet is really not necessary given the parking is all of about 20 feet from the door  However the valet attendant was very nice and had our cars ready even before we got out there- Even after all the screw ups our server boasting about how great everything is and fishing for a big tip we got no apologies for any of the mistakes they madeNeedless to say I will never go to this place again This experience could be an anomaly but I'd be surprised if they're still in business 6 months from now.
I've gotta agree with Jesse on the only other review  HOW IS THIS GYM STILL IN BUSINESSThe manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad  Pushy dishonest gym membership sales  I've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls rarely see them doing any workA few of the front desk staff were cool  Just very underpaid and obviously passing throughThe men's locker room is disgusting  No joke more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with itI do believe about 80% of the problem is with the manager  A quick renovation and new management could do wonders for this spotWhy did I keep going  Convenience and locked into a 1 year employee benefit type membership  I visited the gym about 40 times over 5 months while I was recovering from injury and at least it has a pool 2 large jacuzzis (jet therapy) steam room and free weightswhen they are operable  I can't tell you how many times I've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front deskOne Sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym  I eventually just left after 45 minutes who knows when they finally showed up  I saw about 40 members either waiting or came and leftWorst Gym (Management) Ever.
Broth is super cold hard noodles super salty I'm not even trying to compare the texture of ramen vs hot pot / pho / steamed noodles It's just that lacking of flavor which I could have prepared a better meal at home  Other than that service was friendly All of the add on items on the menu are ridiculous and overpriced I won't be back.
Shame on me for going back here I haven't been since my last review and really wanted to love this place again If I could I would give negative stars now  I had not had a pedicure in about 10 months (I just had a baby and don't do pedicures while pregnant) I wanted to pamper myself a little I read another yelper's review and yes this is NOT a spa HOWEVER they offer these particular services and therefore they should be performing these services correctly and appropriatelyI went late in the day (got there about 75 minutes before closing) because I had to wait for my husband to get home from work but thought I arrived in plenty of time When I signed in the owner looked immediately at the clock At that point I knew I shouldn't have come in that late My fault there The gal came out and showed me to my chairbaby cockroach alive running around in the chair She brushed it off and it fell into the water where I was going to place my feet I understand there is a sandwich shop next door but why cockroaches in a nail place Also someone's dinner or lunch sat in a paper bag in the next chair over from me such ambianceThe nail tech watched the clock like a hawk to the point it made me uncomfortable She got done in a record time if 45 minutes She flew out the door in front of me as I handed her a tip I paid for a deluxe pedicure and think I was taken advantage of because there was nothing "deluxe" about it NEVER will I go back I don't know why I fooled myself into returning again Furthermore the paint chipped on one of my toes the very next day  As I said shame on me.
Just ordered from Silver Mine Subs  Despite ordering online so they would have perfect information order still was delivered over an hour later do to going to the wrong address  Driver didn't care as he already had the tip from the order online Just said "Sorry bud" in a bored voice  Hot food is cold now as well NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN.
We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise AZ What was our horrific crime Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer one that my husband has ordered there and received at least five times Today the manager refused to do it saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant Everyone who It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah) as we always did but he blew up and told us to get outWe are clean-cut polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's We tip well love the food have a good rapport with the staff and never cause a problem there This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's and that manager has seen us before Thanks to his nasty attitude today we won't be back and that's a shame Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches great latkes and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages The sandwiches are big enough to share but we always buy two and take leftovers home It's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup Now he lost our business $60 every other week adds up Archie's In this economy isn't customer retention importantThink long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here We won't make that mistake again.
This husband and wife team are expensive and conduct unnecessary procedures to run up your bill  Dr Perez did such a horrible root canal job on one of my molars that I lost the tooth and now the bone wont healtherefore I cannot get an implant  It seemed every time I went in they would spend too much time "measuring my gum line" and not fixing the problem(s)  Dont waste your time or money on these so-called dentists.
Absolutely horrible service twice The first time they told my mother to come right down and they could take her right back I raced home from work and met her there where they said we will take you back in a few minutes One and a half hours later they took her It would have been fine had they said that from the beginning but you don't tell people "right back" and then have it be 15 hours Second time we had an appointment and got there and after waiting 30 minutes past the appointment time someone came out and said it would be another 45 minutes So what exactly was the point of the appointment I am wondering No one ever apologized either time and said they were running behind or anything In the future when we need x-rays/MRI's we will be looking for a new place to go Service here is just unacceptable.
Resort I don't think so We spent over an hour getting moved from one room to the next trying to find a halfway decent place to sleep 1st room: Strong mildew smell2nd room: Cigarette Smell (later found out the building used to be a smoking building)3rd room: Toilet was broken and made intermittent sounds4th room: Lighter mildew smellWe were so tired by the 4th room that we gave up moving rooms and just decided to call it a night Each time they sent someone out with a new key (a 15+ minute process) Then we'd drive to the new room only to find the next problem and start the wait all over againThe rooms feel more like a motel than anything else They have those old-fashioned motel-style AC units that are ridiculously loud Don't pay more than $40 for a night in this "resort".
READ THIS REVIEW if you are willing to do the following:1) support a local business2) have a knack for bitter and angry women3) take time of work meaning a whole day of work 4) be on call and not do anything until they come to your home5) be hung up on6) PAY for crappy servicea lady from this 7 person office calls me in reference to a service that was schedule between 1-4 pm  this was per the property manager However there was a miscommunication between the business and the manager all I knew was it was between 1pm to 4pmi was on my way to the house to take care of the issue  Before i forget to mention this  A lady calls me at 12:50 asking me how far was I from the home  i answered give me 15 minutes (I was still thinking about the 1-4pm time slot) she then said you know this is not going to happen  the property manger this the property manager that  this is ridiculous and you guys should've been there and went on and on and on and on  and she was on my cars bluetooth on blast with my 11 and 9 year and  i said well i apologize for that i will there as soon as possible then she said  no its not going to happen ma'am not today  this is not going to happen ma'am  she uses the word ma'am like she was to say *insert profanity here*  then i asked how can we resolve this maybe  if we can work on rescheduling (first of all WHY am I as the consumer would be trying to make things work when she was standoffish to begin with IDK maybe i am still hoping for world peace)  and she was like ugh no I need to call American Home Shield and the owner I don't know this is ridiculous and I asked well can we get a time maybe for next week and then call us if its possible or not and she NO MA'AM I AM NOT GOING TO THAT all loud  and asked  excuse me did I say something to offend you  and here goesSHE HUNG UP i called back and she said YES I HUNG UP ON YOU and hung up again I was disappointed with the property manager and made sure he knew I felt however Angry lady's action was uncalled for wow now i know why some people pay a premium for larger companies  since this will not be toleratedWhen i read the review from Mollie C  why am I not surprisedThe following has been done:1) filed an executive complaint with the BBB2) a copy was sent to American Home Shield and the FTC  just in case this company tries to make a quick buckand ask for the $75 deductible 2) a letter to Mr Little  the owner and according to the grumpy lady on the phone he was the "technician" he that was waiting do I guess if the owner of the company is performing the service  you need to bow down to him  its like the president of the United states is doing you a favor and exempted all taxes due for you and your familySCOREthis is the worst service I have received  better yet treatment from a COMPLETE stranger.
1 star for service and attitudeThe food was delicious  but the staff was very hateful I am writing this review I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short  hispanic  and she was pregnant at the time She was incredibly hatefulSo hateful and rude to me and my parents I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked  but that really wasn't the caseI went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently More "manly" (ha) Different waitresses  same great food  same hateful attitudes I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.
service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
Bleh Bland tasteless pizza squishy pasta watery sauce The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD Such a bummer since it is so close to my house.
I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor The Fish MarketBoy was I mistakenFirst there was nothing that resembled a typical lunch menuEverything on the  menu was $$ including the 1/2 sandwich and fries for 995 which I'm sorry I orderedThe sandwich was remarkably small with 1 small piece of lettuce slice of tomato and what looked liked a small scoop of tuna The bread looked like it may have been right out of a loaf of Roman Meal breadThe fries seemed like a normal small portionWhen served I recall how astonished I was at how small the entire combination was and how I knew I would be hungry afterward since I don't eat fries however the substitutions came at an extra chargeWhich meant I just got a tiny half sandwich for 10 bucks or a tiny sandwich with cole slaw for even more $This was a lunch experience that made me angry with each passing moment i sat there fuming primarily due to the lackluster portion the price and the mediocre service I really dont like to score a place one star but in this case if Bluewater has the stones to sell a small ordinary 1/2 sandwich for 10 bucks I feel the need to tell anyone interested how this place offers absolutely no value for the $$I will never go back to this place Once bitten twice shy as the saying goes.
The seating is horrible The service was even worse  It feels like they are geared more for Take Out  There was enough staff but no one seemed to know what to do aka refill my Tea glass / take my order / and the no silverware thing again  2 of the 3 things I ordered from their menu they were out of (Mole and a dessert)  Then the waiter tried to talk me into another dish by saying it was his favorite  Will never go back  Sucky experience.
Large group showed up and manager bad mouthed them to other customers So that was classy.
Business is closed.
Word to the wise order your burger well done here You and your toilet will be thankful PS Employees handling food should always wash their handsThat's all I am going to say.
we had a 7:45 reservation last night and were not seated til almost one hour late During this time we were given no updates on when we might be seated  It was suggested that we go to the bar but it was 10 deep and looked like the bar  scene in Star Wars so that was not an option  It is unconscionable for a restaurant as expensive as yours to treat your guests like cattle Our waiter was efficient enough but not professional and thought his job was to entertain us like Henny YoungmenWe also noted that the portions of food have been made significantly smaller ie(the swordfish) with no reduction in price.
Simply awful  We had heard a few people rave about this place and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage  The "cheese" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color  That was the worst of it but nothing was good at all  And crazy price to boot.
I called and the associate on the phone informed me that the Copper Door is OUT OF BUSINESSThanks a lot I just bought a $25 coupon to this establishment from Restaurantcom two days ago.
We bought tires less than 2 1/2 years ago from this Fletcher  They were Firestone tires which have splitting issues    They are  now splitting and are not standing by their warranty  Interesting that Fletcher no longer sells Firestone tires  That's because they sold us a bad product  DO NOT buy tires here  They do not stand by their product   Go to Big O or Discount Tire  I know they warrant their tires.
First time I've ever felt like a leper in a restaurant  I come to Scottsdale for business once a month  I was staying at the Hyatt Place across the parking lot and decided to go at about 7:00 on a Thursday to grab dinner on my own  When I got to the restaurant the front part was empty but the other side of the bar had people at some tables and at the bar  I was told by someone when I walked in to sit anywhere I liked  So I looked around and since I didn't want to sit at the bar I picked one of the three open 4-top tables available as there were no 2-tops open  And then I sat  About 8 minutes later after watching the waitresses walk past me a number of times one actually stopped and then proceeded to ask if I would move to the bar  She said that she had larger groups that would want the table  There was no one waiting for tables but she explained to me that a DJ would be starting in 10 minutes and it would get crowded  "Lucky" for me the two-top next to me was getting ready to leave so she said I could wait and just move to that table  In the meantime she did ask me if I wanted a drink  I asked about their bourbon selection but it was non-existent so I ordered a beer  She brought me a beer and then cleaned the table next to me so I moved  She then disappeared for five minutes before bringing me a menu  Once she brought me the menu it was another 10 minutes of waiting  I saw my waitress standing at the bar texting on her phone while the other waitress walked passed me four times  My waitress finally came back and took my orderThe food was very goodNo DJ ever came on and half way through my meal she sat two people at the four-top table next to me that she asked me to vacate  No on ever asked how my food was  When I was finished I sat there for a few minutes and then one waitress took my empty plate and the other brought me a check  I never asked for the check I actually thought I might have another beer but since it was obvious they weren't going to offer and just didn't seem to want me there I paid and leftJust to be clear I was wearing a relatively expensive suit looked very professional and find it hard to believe I was "undesirable"  For some reason I was  I will NEVER return to this restaurant  I prefer to go someplace where I am made to feel comfortable welcome and wanted  It was very disappointing.
This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal I ordered take out once service was terrible and I'm never coming backI give it a try so I order the Torta del Barrio to go with fries It's a vegetarian option for $13 including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables One gentleman was in front of me so I wait after my orderThree people order after me within 15 minutes each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish) They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good The fries were soggy and bland and the bread for the torta tasted stale No way that cost $13 I could've made that for under $5The restaurant didn't look that much better The place was packed and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there and they definitely ordered before I arrivedWhen you're trying to fly out you want a quick bite to eat The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last The most I got out of the cashier was "Sorry I tried" If you're going to serve food at the airport that kind of service won't cut itI've never said this before but I'd have preferred fast food at the time.
Thai rama ding don't go hereThere are many better options and the $150 you save is just not worth the shortcomingsService was lax the spring roll was hard and cold the rice was dried out on top and the dish lacked spice and a good flavorIt was a Wednesday lunch a11:30 and this place was already packed which is usually a good sign  I went for the lunch special Mango Delight $650 "hot" of courseThe cabbage soup that is included came out but to my disappointment it has chicken in it not veg friendlyOur meals finally started to arrive (about 5 min apart) which is annoying as I like to eat when my food arrives but I also have manners  On the plate there was a small portion of fried tofu with veggies and grilled mango while the grilled mango was nice the rest of the items were lackluster As I stated the rice and spring roll both had issues and the wonton chips were not the freshest If you really want to add an odd element to you meal there is the spicy caddy that has Thai chilies in an extremely foul smelling liquid Thoughts of that smell alone still haunt meBottom line at $650 the lunch prices are good but the lack of quality and taste lead me to go elsewhere.
Wow this store needs to re visit customer service 101 and T- mobile needs to drop them for representing themI have used T- mobile for over 10 years and have always had good service and been a happy user  I lost my earphones for my droid phone and stopped by this store (big sign is T-Mobile on store front)After waiting in line for awhile I was told the skull brand ($20) would work fine and I made sure that they would work on my phone and I could use them for the phoneLeft store thinking hmmm don't think I would ever want to go back there and tried the headset and low and behold they did not work  Was unable to hang up phone from the headset or answer phone from headset  Quick U-turn about a couple of miles down the road and back to this store to return and see if they had another choice  Waited in line again and then the same person (rep#2550714) looked at me like what the heck are you doing back heresaid yesand I told him they did not work like he told me they would and I am returning them  Ok he said  So hubby finds another brand that should work and we asked if these would work and he said he didn't know  He asks another guy working there and they conclude that no they are only for listening to music (even though packaging states it is for phone too) Treating me like I am some dumb person he does the transaction for the return and is clearly done with me  Hubby and I look at each other and give each other the look like are you kidding me and let's get the hell out of here fastT-mobilebased on that experience I am finally sick of this treatment and upon my contract being up I am going elsewhere  You need to check out the places that are supposed to represent you and if I were you I would fire them on the spot  They suck at customer serviceBTWon the way home we stopped at a verizon place and were greeted by a lovely young lady who was more than happy to sell me some headphones and offered to make sure they worked before we left  They are next on my list to get my businessIf you want T-Mobile don't even waste your time at this store.
If your interested in bull dogs and favoritism  you've found your home  Beware of undercover trolls posing as owners protecting his Bitches More balls here than the Phoenix Mercury basketball team apparently Not lbgt friendly  Perhaps a new location outside of the parralegram is time.
We were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies The place was not busy yet they said that it would be a 45 min wait to be seated out sideSo we took the first available15 minutes later after I spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was 45 minutes yet no one is here We were seatedFood options seemed interesting but NOT for the priceAtmosphere is greatIf u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner  If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here.
No more $1 beers and lowered crown credits Don't bother going to this shit hole It has gone way downhill in the last few months Machines are outdated and now my favorite quarter machines that actually have a bonus feature were changed to a penny denomination Won't be back Poor return for what your bet is Virtually impossible to even win a little to keep playing Take your business to Casino Arizona.
Im suprised this place managed to rate as high as it did  This place is just down the street from me so I decided to give it a try  I live to regret that decision  We ordered chopped pork ribs  and some sides and I didn't like any of it  I couldn't eat it  The whole group felt that way Maybe we caught them on an off day but I don't plan on finding out There is no way I'll be returning.
First things first no waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again It wasn't even busy There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here When we came up to pay the bill was super overpriced I will not be returning here I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.
I love there food So good and delicious Also clean and organize And you don't have to wait long time tell you get the food so happy So happy that I visit  this place .
I made appointments for my daughter and I to have mani-pedicures  We are from another state and I just moved here and she was visiting me and we thought it would be fun  I checked Yelp and saw good reviews so I was thinking this would be a great treat for my daughter  I had the man working on me and he did a passable job but the woman who worked on my daughter didn't speak any English and within hours her manicure was chipping off and she had to re-file her toenails because they were so jagged and sharp  Our feet were so dry from the pedicures that we had to apply tons of lotion to them to make them stop hurting  The manicures hurt for days from all nicks we had around our nails from the cuticle scissors they used  We would not recommend this nail salon to anyone  By the time my daughter left from her vacation her nail polish had completely chipped off  What a waste of $8500.
Well my daughter and I went in for lunch We arrived at 2:13pm We were seated and the table was not too clean The hostess came over and asked for our drink order I asked which lunch specials came with a drink she then informed me that the lunch specials were over at two  I told her I thought the lunch specials lasted till four I asked her if they would honor the lunch specials since it was only 13 minutes after two and was told no I explained to her that I would leave if I didn't get the special She shrugged as if she didn't care and we walked out The sad part is that I eat at this place three maybe four times a month The food is great and the staff is always friendly I'm really disappointed I hope they were happy that Wendy's got my $16 for lunch.
There are bees everywhere swarming the whole drive thru don't roll down your windows Truly Nolan is here but they are not doing anything to solve the problemThis was not a fun experience I pulled up to the drive thru window and bees swarmed into my car I kept yelling for the drive thru attendant to hurry and hand me my food and she was just starring at me through the window cause she was to afraid to open the window Meanwhile a plethora of bees let themselves into my vehicle I was so irritated at the whole situation I just drove off without getting my food I will never return to this place again I should probably seek legal advice since the drive through was still taking customers while knowing that had a swarm of bees in the drive through.
So I went yesterday with some friends for their 40th Anniversary They had good deals going on pretty much 50% off of a few dishes So I had "Half Spaghetti With White Clam Sauce & Half Meat Sauce With A Meatball" The pasta was $395 the Meatball was $375 they say they give you two but its really only one that they cut in half So to be honest even at Half price for the Pasta I felt like I paid to much Pasta was under cooked no flavor in the Meat Sauce the Clam Sauce was the worst I had took one bite sent it back I understand it was their Anniversary and they had half of food so they didn't put there all into it but it wasn't busy at all so the the food should have not been under cooked You would think knowing that people are gonna come you would want to entice them to come back It was my first and last time going here sad to say.
Mehpizza was super greasycheese was gummycrust was bland $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's Never again.
My wife and I tried Nimbus for the first time tonight  All signs pointed to this being a potential new go-to spot in our neighborhood  We were hoping for a place with good beer interesting food choices and a fun atmosphereInstead I rate this as my worst dining experience of 2012 so far  We walked over from our house and when we were seated we asked for water  It took 5 minutes to get it and the water glasses were dinky  Hello - this is Arizona  We need something other than kid-sized glasses of water  I ordered a happy hour martini and it was undrinkable  After sending ti back I ordered an oatmeal stout that tasted like flat Coke  My wife had a blonde ale and she chose not to finish it (very unusual for her)  If we hadn't already ordered dinner we would have left at this point  The buffalo chicken pizza was decent but very greasy  The fried zucchini was inedible  To top it off there was a networking event happening on the other side of the dining area  Our pizza arrived at the same time that the event speakers began to use their mics to broadcast their message to the entire place  I was treated to a diatribe about diabetes during dinner  While this is a worthy cause it was totally obnoxious during dinnerThe food is overpriced the beer is mediocre the happy hour menu is limited (no burger - really) and the ambiance is horrible  Needless to say we will not return  Word to the wise - if you are looking for a good happy hour Ruth Chris is just around the corner and has amazing values and a great patio.
Had the Shrimp Fried Rice and Mongolian beef No flavor the flavor extractor was used  Big disappointment.
A friend and I went here for lunch today We received a lukewarm (I'll be with you guys in a minute) greeting from a server Same server took us to our table piss poor attitude Our actual server provided the same lukewarm greeting Note to restaurants: TRAIN your servers to not address guests as "You Guys" especially when one of the guests is a lady We ordered a pizza with tomatoes mushrooms and sausage (sausage only on half) They messed up our first pizza and brought us out another This restaurant is nothing like the namesake in Brooklyn Decent food bad service I will not be going back here or any other Grimaldi's except the original in Brooklyn.
Looked good from far but far from good  Dined there jan3 for dinner&  it was our first time  We walked in and stood at the hostess station for about 4 minutes with no acknowledgment  Finally I asked the girl if we needed to put our names in for seating  After not getting seated for about 10 minutes (out of order) we started browsing the buffet  There is quite a variety of different dishes that you wouldn't see at a normal chinese buffet  By the time you had to narrow your choices from either dry or burnt rubbery entrees we settled on the safer choices  The waiter didn't show up to take our drink order for about 5 minutes  We didn't actually get our hot tea until we were finished with our first plates  The tea wasn't even jasmine tea  It was a lipton tea bag    He never checked on us or even picked up one single plate throughout our entire meal  I asked him how long they had been open he said since october  Now tell me how a restaurant that is only 3 months old can have the worst hostesses wait staff & cooks imaginable  I had mentioned to the waitor how unacceptable everything was  he apologized and then took another 30 minutes to give us the bill  The price for an adult was 1599 and my 4 yr Old was charged $388 Plus the two bucks for the bitter lipton tea  There was no attempt to get a manager to rectify the situation  Clearly nobody cares what you think  I was so infuriated that a lack of management presence allows these" teenagers" and their lackidaisical attitudes run this place  So i'm yelping   Mediocre food high prices and crappy service  Will never go back again unless they pull their act together and start getting better reviews.
Wow I've never been to such a slow fatburger I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line and 1 burger in process ahead of me and it took more than 30 minutes I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill  The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain  Don't come unless you have lots of time.
No stars  It's amazing that Pebbletec allows Prado to install their product because of their poor workmanship and no customer service skills  We have been waiting to receive a reply from them for months now to no avail  Use another vendor you'll thank yourself in the future.
Good food if you can get attention One guy that works there pays no attention to the register and after 10 min waiting LOOKING at him just staring at the computer behind the bar made me decide I'll wait and maybe next time I go for a haircut they will be paying attention :(.
Closed.
Worst bar I've ever been to I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer The bartenders are rude the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude Also  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.
This place is AWFUL NEVER take your car to Big O Tires I took my car in at the recommendation of a friend to have my tires replaced after getting hot tar on them (Darn Arizona summers) They convinced me to buy all 4 new tires I leave and have to return TWO more times to get the car properly balanced The 3rd time I was there they told me that they only had 1 guy who could properly balance my car and he wasn't in that day and to come back tomorrow I brought my car in the next day to get the car balanced AGAIN and get an oil change They told me they didn't have time to do the oil change and I'd have to come back AGAIN to get it done It also took over an hour and a half before they even looked at my car despite making an appointment They were quite rude both days as if it was my fault the car wasn't balanced right They finally got it right the third time and I have never been back I would not suggest ANYONE take their car here EVER.
Ordered pizza today as we had a coupon  Had 3 different kinds-never again  Not good pizza.
Do not go to this place if you are hungry  I am very disappointed with this Arcadia Farms  I have never had such a horrible experience at one location  Some friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday only to find out that they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am  This doesn't make sense  We decided that we would stay for  lunch  I decided to split the California Turkey Club with the potato salad  with a friend  After 45 minutes later we finally got our food  The server did stop to tell us that the kitchen was behind but made no offer if we would like some bread to pass the time  The California Turkey Club was very disappointing  It was all bread and nothing in the middle  Very little turkey on this sandwich  I wish the server would have said how the potato said was made  It was covered in mayo which did not sit well with our stomachs  I have been to Arcadia Farms before for breakfast and had an amazing entree and service  This time the food and service were really lacking  We received our bill and noticed that we got charged $3 for splitting our plates  I did not see this on the menu or  the server did not mention to us when we placed the order  $3 for a can of Diet Coke  Why are you upcharging for a can of soda  I love supporting local places but this place has lost a customer.
Like the other reviewer said if you show up to the actual shop you'll be attended by a jerk Next time I will just have the van come out to me instead of going to the actual store I don't know what is wrong with that guy Stay away from the store.
I loathe to write a bad review for one of my favorite hobbies drinking craft beer however Sun Up is a brewing company that I feel the need to never visit again nor would I recommend beer lovers to go out of their way to stop inThe majority of the beer was just plain boring and warm to boot They had a lager wheat amber pale oatmeal stout and a scottish red on draft  None of the beer sampled tasted even close to what I would consider the fundamentals of that particular category ie a very bitter amber ale and a sweet and not-hoppy-whatsoever pale ale  Even the root beer was flat and tasteless  I initially was going to give this place two stars mainly because they do serve beer and the bartender was nice  but thinking about the beer I have to knock this down to one star  Sorry Sun Up but you need to go back to the drawing board and create some good basic craft brew.
We came here to celebrate my brother and my husband's birthdays  We will never pick this place again  The service was SO slow and the food was mediocre at best  We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people  The jar was passed back and forth throughout the dinnerSupremo Italiano - It was only thing good from this dinner but not the BEST pizza   (spicy Italian sausage pepperoni bell peppers onions mozzarella provolone and meat sauce)Chicken & Sausage Ziti - This dish was so watered down  Tasteless  HORRIBLE  (chicken breast mild Italian sausage red onions roma tomatoes and spinach in garlic cream sauce)Linguine Frutti di Mare - This dish was ok  (shrimp baby clams mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)Spaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish  The meatballs was horrific  The meat was low grade and after eating it I lost my appetite  I don't think it was meat at all  YUCKWe waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes   And spend a couple hundred of dollars.
One year ago I would have rated the place a four out of five  Since that time the staff has gone straight to crap  Front desk girls are typically either rude or indifferent and some of the trainers are jerks  Also as another individual mentioned the towels they switched to are cheap and wouldn't dry off a 90 pound female  The showers and men's locker room have always been relatively gross so that hasn't gotten worse over the last 12 months but it hasn't gotten better either  After they went to the 1999/month plan (around the first of the year) they completely oversold their membership  So not only is it impossible to maneuver the locker room it is also now impossible to manuever the weight room  Not to mention if you plan on incorporating bench work or squats into your workout you can count on waiting for a bench or the SINGLE squat rackLastly the clientele of this gym is weak  I've never seen so many fake hardos in my life  Guys wearing sunglasses while they work out etc etcAnyway the last straw was today when I had to wait for a locker to open up  You must be kidding me Gold's Gym  Cancelled this afternoon and will be taking my money to Lifetime.
I'VE NEVER SPAT OUT SO MUCH FOOD IN MY LIFE I WISH THE MEMORY OF THIS PLACE WERE AS SHORT AS THE TIME THE FOOD SPENT IN MY STOMACH I barely got home before I was wretching it all out All hail to the porcelain godSometimes those Curious George moments of exploratory inquest (like Diamonds on 7th Ave) should just be suppressed In the case of Great China Super Buffet curiosity _will_ kill the catIn case you're dragged there by your kidnappers:--green beans with you-can't-believe-it's-not-butter slipperyness is swallowable--fresh fruit with sugary sweet red-colored corn syrup slathered all over it it is fruit after all--cantaloupe honeydew and red grapes are the ONLY safe items in the whole place--cook-to-order BBQ bar is a novelty but the meat quality is little better than Bantha Poo-doo104 items tasted and spat The notable worst of the worst:--cooked seafood Krab pieces and wonton noodles buried under a pile of melted cheese think gag reflex--butter mushrooms squishy rubber which if not held carefully in the mouth while chewing might bounce into your throat and choke you--halved hard-boiled eggs how can a hard boiled egg be so dry it's crunchy--gloopy globs of "honey" "sweet" "bbq" and 30 other substitute names for breaded fried and corn-syruped to death it'll be _your_ death--bbq pork ribs are little more than charred fat left on the bone painted red and then baked EW--oh i almost forgot the horrible mystery sushi rolls don't let the brightly colored drizzle sauce fool you--shell-on shrimps mean naive customers are about to eat shrimp poop DE-VEIN THEM OR DON'T SERVE THEM YOU PIGSSLASH MEXICAN--China is close enough of a translation in Spanish Still they serve Mexican food here too--"Fried Rice" is little more than pasty-orange "Spanish"-style but it's NASTY--Enchiladas At a Chinese place Come on--Burritos WHAT--oh and Pizza and Garlic Bread PIGSTY--flies swarmed in the walkways between islands and kitchen--dishes and leftover food stacked endlessly behind half-wall stations in buser tub after buser tub--carpet is so filthy you might slip and slide--glass doors entry walkway tile and hostess counters haven't been cleaned in months--pussy ooze dripped off the mouth of the gumball machine in the entryway@Rand H -- Are you an investor or something I hope you have insurance You CAN'T be serious about a fiver review Boo@The-rest-of-you Make me wish I could "enemy" yelpers Why didn't you give me a proper goddam warningI **AM** GOING TO CALL THE EFFING HEALTH INSPECTOR .
All I can say is yuck I expect a lot from chain/franchises Maybe the food won't be the highest quality but the service and cleanliness should be right on And it should be fastI went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time The last time I went I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out I got home and started eating it and would you believe it it tasted like cigarettes Clearly whoever made it had just been smoking came back inside and made my food without washing their hands Respulsive I didn't even bother to go back to complainI will never give Einsteins my business againLooking through Yelp I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration We may not be official food critics but we do know what is going on.
I bought some frozen Indian entrees from Sunflower Market and it reminded me of the time I ate here My boyfriend's parents were in town for Spring Break this year and I had been wanting to try this place out for quite some time so the four of us grabbed an early dinner after watching the A's beat the White SoxI should have known it was going to be a poor experience when we drove up and saw how "fancy" the outside was Our waiter was rude and when taking our order he dropped the (empty) tray once There were only a couple of other tables with people at them so it was pretty loud When our food came the waiter dropped my plate on the table and my food got all over the table my shirt and even my purse He brought me napkins a few minutes later so I could clean up his mess and dropped his empty tray yet again It took him forever to bring us the bill or extra Naan or anything we ordered Each time we waited I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingersThe food was very bland Even with a ton of heat/spice the blandness overpowered everything My boyfriend's mom is not picky at all but she could not eat her food The only reason I'd even give this place one star is the mango Lassi was delicious the naan was good and my boyfriend and his father really enjoyed their huge Taj Mahal's.
This review is for the Clinique Make up counter in the Dillards store I have traveled and dealt with many Dillards and Macys make up and perfume counters I usually get excellent service and they even remember me because I return every year When I went to the Clinique counter this past month the counter manager was very unprofessional and rude She reprimanded a Clinique saleswoman (that was actually doing an excellent job with me) and made her feel like crawling in a hole for doing nothing wrong then she made up some excuse to help me instead of the sales associate that had been helping me Now -  I was in sales and I know how hard it is and how time consuming it is to make a good sale and then this manager just came over and took me away and kept the sale I was going to go the the head manager of Dillards and complain but at that time I had to just leave The woman that originally waited on me had my name even in her files and the manager still took the sale sorry but that's just wrong I will not go back.
I won't be going here again for dinner The waitress hardly came over to check up on us I could understand if she had other tables to attend tobut she only had one other table besides ours It took us over 20 minutes for us to actually pay for our bill When my friend and I both asked for refills (we both had the same drink) she came back 5 minutes later with one refillthen asked if I wanted one too Well obviouslyI'm the one who asked in the first placeThe food was bland I have been here one other time and figured maybe it was just an off night Butthis time around the food was just as horrible We hardly ate our meals All togethernot a great experience I'll stick with Oregano's if I want Italian.
Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88Way to keep it classy over there.
When you have the corner restaurant on Mill and University you better bring it  With that being said I think this place has a long way to go and I think it's going to close down before that time comesIt's a great concept  I can imagine it being a decent place for a night life  I wasn't there for that  I was there at noon on a Monday  Bad ideaMy wife mom and I ordered the cheese burger  How can you go wrong  My wife went to order it medium rare and got a disclaimer from the nice but incredibly forgetful waitress (I'll get to that later) that medium rare is very rare here  She talked her into ordering it medium  I still stuck with medium rare  My burger came out like a hockey puck while my mom and wife's came out medium well  I sent mine back  My dad ordered biscuits and gravy they looked good but my dad felt like the gravy came out of a canThe waitress was a nice girl  I can imagine working there she might get a lot of stuck up and rude clientele  What I don't understand is she would suggest something we'd get it and then she'd forget it  Eg: side salad for my wife order of fries for my dad swiss on my moms burger  All were forgotten and brought out when reminded  There were maybe 2 other tables there and 2 waitresses on duty  She wrote everything down  I guess she had a long weekend  Good thing her personality kept her from getting a full tipBottom line this food is terrible  The service is terrible  This place has nothing going on for itself  From reading Daniel R's review I can see that this place may redeem itself in a nightlife situation but I'll never find out for myself.
Food quality has gone way downI used to come here frequently and really liked the Pho  Unfortunately the last two times I went the food was awful  The meat quality was really poor  The taste was not the same  There was a lot of fat  One time the meat looked weird maybe overcooked and I felt ill after eating  I gave the place one more shot and it was still bad  I won't be back until I know the quality is back to what it used to be  :(.
I really love the food here I have never had anything from the menu that I did not enjoy However I will never return to this establishment after the way I was treated this eveningAfter finishing our meals I gave my credit card to our server to pay our bill Upon returning to our table and leaving the receipt for my signature the server as an afterthought told me that she had accidentally charged another bill to my credit card I was then told that the charge was for about $5000 and that it would be credited back to my account in 2-3 business days Needless to say I was not happy and asked to speak with the manager Prior to getting to my conversation with the manager let me explain my thinking Based on what the server told me I was charged $5000 by mistake and then was charged $6773 for my bill The server understood that the $5000 (even with a credit authorization run) was going to show as pending on my account and would take up available funds or credit on my account Rather than come tell me of the mistake that was made the server put through the credit authorization and then charged my bill to the account The server had no way of knowing if the funds would be available for both charges but knew that for at least 2-3 business days both charges would take up funds or credit from my account This means that in the event that this extra $5000 put me over my credit limit or overdrew my account I would be left holding the bag with the server never having thought to ask me if I could afford to be without the extra $5000 for 2-3 days Essentially my thinking is that the server's actions were a horrible way to handle the situation I spoke with the manager and he was completely uncaring about the situation He basically told me that it was only $5000 and that I would get it back in 2-3 business days He then proceeded to ask me if I had the $5000 available and that if I did it was no big deal I explained that even if I had the $5000 I was now $5000 poorer due to his company's action He did not careI then returned to my table and used my phone to check the charges on my account It was not a $5000 but a $7647 charge Both the server and manager lied about the amount that was incorrectly charged to my account This upset me I found the manager and explained the discrepancy in what I was told and the facts Again the manager was not concerned Basically the server and manager had lowered the incorrectly charged sum by more that 1/3 Then the purported owner of the establishment told me "this happens all the time and no one has ever been upset about it" You read that correctly IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME This restaurant should not be trusted with your plastic I am just thankful that it wasn't a $50000 bill that was charged to my card I will never again visit this place of business due to the way in which this situation was handled.
The gas at this station is not the problem here It's the Car Wash  My car was filthy due to the rainy days we'd had in the Phoenix area I drove my car to Tumbleweed to get gas as well as get a car wash After driving through I noticed several weird streaks on my car I tried to buff them out with a clean towel only to make it worse At first I thought maybe my car was so dirty that it needed a second wash About a week later I returned to this same station for gas and a wash Again with the weird streaks all over my car I have washed my car at this station over the last few years when it was a Valero and never had this issue Now I am absolutely convinced that the new owners do not maintain the chemicals for the Car Wash I paid for two Car Washes within two weeks $8  each  The Ultimate Car Wash What it was  was an Ultimate waste of money Do not wash your car here unless you want it to look worse than it did before.
I used to love Banana Republic  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits I wasted quite a bit of time in this storeto an frazzeling degree  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach  I was looking to dress sharp and professional not wrinkled and hap-hazzard  I wanted short sleeves not flimsy spagetti straps long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (helloits JUNEand ARIZONA)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.
Like a previous reviewer mentioned Chicken fingers are a staple item When you order them at a restaurant you know what to expect It's always at least a solid meal and sometimes it's a truly great oneSo it's kind of amazing to me that a place that sells ONLY that can screw it up so bad The chicken fingers have soggy weak breading that is devoid of any satisfying crunch that you can usually find on chicken fingers The actual taste of the fingers themselves is slightly "off" almost like the chicken is toeing the line of going bad The sauce (which if you don't order a meal you have to pay extra for) is some weird amalgamation of other sauces that work as chicken finger dips that ends up being off-putting and weirdly spice-flavored (you're better off with ketchup here as lame as that is) The texas toast despite looking like it's a step-up from something standard tastes like ordinary toasted bread In its defense it's the least offensive thing here And lastly the french fries something that many would compare to pizza in that even when they're bad they're still pretty good are genuinely pretty bad and some of the worst fast-food fries I've ever eaten They look like freezer-section Ore-Ida fries they taste like Ore-Ida fries and I would be pretty damn shocked if I found out that they weren't actually just Ore-Ida friesEating here was an awful experience but under some circumstances it could be salvaged I've had meals this bad before at restaurants where you had other options and later grown to love some of the alternative choices I've had meals this bad before at restaurants where the food was cheaper and enjoyed the fact that I could grab a bite on a budget But I've never had a meal this bad at a restaurant that ONLY sells the one item for such an un-appealing price I can't think of a single good thing to say about this place and can't imagine any reason why I would ever want to return here.
New ownershipBig time mehThis place is counter service  I ordered a LARGE chicken dynamite/dynamic (don't remember the specific name) fried rice with $2 drink and egg roll combo$1162 total  OK kinda stiff  Let's see if the food justifies the costNOPEPortion was small  There was get this the smallest portion of rice that I've ever seen in a fried rice order  I couldn't believe itAnyways I will not be going back  Thai Elephant I never should have betrayed you.
Sixty minutes after our reservation we were seated  N o other expensive restaurant I have ever been in ( NYC Europe San Fransisco) has ever treated us so shabbily  fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices  the waiters are actors trying to promote poor and expensive food with clever worrisome.
WORST customer service EVER Extremely rude and VERY unorganized Will NEVER return It amazes me how a small business like this would treat customers as they did me and my sister maybe it was becuase we were women They told us a different story everyday about an item we ordered We finally received it 4 weeks later When we were told the day we ordered it it would be in the next day Plus you walk in to the place and there is just stuff EVERYWHERE just clutter and not very appealing at all.
OhMyGodIt's been a loooooong time since I've been served food this bad before We ordered beef egg foo young honey garlic pork barbeque ribs and it came with white riceThe rice was good and was by far the highlight of our meal The beef egg foo young was some sort of high-density hockey puck (that was supposed to be the egg foo young) It had the texture of leather but didn't taste as good as leather It was slathered with a brown gravy that had pieces of beef but the beef was gristle-y and unappetizing The BBQ ribs looked very good but this was misleading One taste suggested this food had "turned" and we didn't eat any more for fear of getting sickThe honey garlic pork dish was tolerable It was small breaded pieces of pork in a sauce that tasted neither like honey nor like garlicThe white rice was good and sticky as white rice should beThe restaurant was clean to their credit including the bathroomI will NEVER go to this place again It's hard to believe a place this bad remains in business It wasn't even particularly well-priced.
Forget itAs a child my parents and I would make the drive out here once a month to eat I loved it I remember it being almost 'grandma's house' friendly I don't remember much about the food but I've been back a few times more recently (before the change in ownership) and loved itBut then some very shady things happened and the business was essentially stolen from the long-time owners I shamefully say that I've since been twice It's not the same by any means There's no soul in the (albeit basic no fancy stuff here) food preparation It's a cold atmosphere as well And the atmosphere used to BE the place There are a few other decent places around Avoid the new Satisfied FrogIt's sad Well according to the website the previous and rightful owners have a new place up in Black Canyon City I'm hoping to be up that way some time soon with any hope the old atmosphere has been transferred.
I'm just really disappointed I usually love it here but Basically I have family in town I brought some of them here last week and it was great Not today The butcher block was half the size from last week And missing items from it  We even had a pic to prove the size difference Just really annoying that the portions are not consistent.
I am not one to typically complain but I feel that Top of the Line Perfume (a store In this "outlet" mall) is a joke They inflate their prices astronomically and then tell the consumer that they will give a 50% discount  The perfume I purchased was $50 marked down from $89 I found it for $20 on Amazon I called to speak with a manager to no avail Naomi an absurdly rude sales associate would not transfer me to a manager Please save your money.
Oregano's you are vile and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen Bland boring and dehydrating No thanks.
I have been here on a few occasions and I was pleased with the selection pricing and customer service but sadly that seems to have gone away Items were on par with Flo's as another reviewer commented and for the selection I have been seeing this does not quite match up I was not greeted by the three ladies at the counter but was rather glared at there was no hello or smiles just a pack of elderly women standing in formation looking me right in the eye as I stroll in Wow welcoming right The more hidden gem seems to be in the warehouse where items are marked down significantly There is less furniture in this area than in the store however Televisions clothing and random items seem to be the majority in the warehouseThere are some cool vintage finds to be found but after being treated like a leper and leaving aggravated I would rather stick to other mom and pop thrift stores and the better Goodwill locations in the valley I don't understand why they would act this way when you want to make visitors feel welcome so they can spend money for a worthy cause I was completely turned off and I won't be returning This is not the only worthy cause in the world 1 star for crappy service and visit the Goodwill on Pima in Scottsdale if you have the time and gas.
Perhaps it was our fault for not having tried Dunkin Donuts before but my husband and I went and tried the egg and bacon croissant sandwich plain coffee a glazed donut and a boston creme donut Our cashier was friendly and chatty but couldn't answer a single question Us: "Is the iced coffee sweetened with high fructose corn syrup" Her: "I don't know it sure is sweet though"Us: "What is in the chocolate kreme donut" Her: "It's really good I've had 3 today I don't know chocolate stuff"Nothing was outright disgusting but it was pretty mediocre The coffee was so hot that we both burned out tongues and once it cooled down it was so weak and flavorless that neither of us can understand how it possibly beat Starbucks in a fair taste test Do the people who participated in the test like coffee Whatever Now we know that we don't like Dunkin but I'm left wondering how the place is so popular let alone still in business with such lackluster product decor and vacuous service.
I've been to MAC twice and not one time out of the 10 people they have working the counter do I ever get asked for help My intentions were to go to lush but we couldn't find it and didn't have much time to find it I had the worse experience at MAC yesterday I wish I wore Lancôme because that lady was attentive and nice I will never spend my money at this MAC counter again.
Every time I go here it seems like the staff has nothing better to be than berate their customers for not "ordering to their standards" One instance I ordered a grande iced coffee sweetened and the woman when I got to the window tried to hand me a hot coffee Clearly she doesn't know it's 105 degrees out and I've been coming here with the same order for oh I don't know three years Used to tip but forget that if I can't even get a correct order Weekend staff is a breath of fresh air but forget coming in the mornings they really don't like their jobs.
Arghh where do I start Well allow me to say that I am not a big fan of Macaroni Grill but the hubby and the kids seem to like it so we go there once in a whileCome to think about it I think we have gotten better service consistently at the Agua Fria and Tatum locations we also went once in Mesa However the few times I have been to the Gold Dust locations huge disappointments Once our daughter's wheat pasta was uncooked and missing the pine nuts (we ordered it because she didn't know what they were) We like the Chianti BBQ Steak and we have had it at Tatum location deliciousWe went to this place for Christmas Eve and we were expecting them to be busy To our surprise we didn't have to wait that long to be seated We got a booth (4 of us) and ordered fetuccini and  Penne Rustica for the kids hubby the Chianti BBQ steak and the Parmesan Veal Chop for me We ate one piece of bread We asked for one more We ate it Our server apologized for the delay Long wait Our server came back and apologized again Long wait Our server nowhere to be seen  Over 50 minutes went by since our order which I think it is beyond a reasonable delay We caught the attention of our server and asked for the managerAfter a while a manager stopped by and explained they had 2 very big parties (he mention the number 17 each I think) in a back room Honestly in my mind this translated to 'we do have customers more important than you' we said this was beyond reasonable and were considering leaving he said being Christmas Eve everywhere would be busy and we would be better off waiting here he offered a discount and left I tried to get his attention to ask how much longer but he didn't hear me or else About 8-10 min later he brought our food As he was leaving I said  pointing to the Chianti steak: this should have prosciutto and crostini 'and garlic dip' added my husband He said the prosciutto is in there and left Well in my mind I translated that as "I am in a hurry so I am going to treat you like an idiot' That is the utmost disrespect and hence the one star There is no discount that makes up for that There was no prosciutto in there At all We caught the attention of our server and mentioned the missing ingredients and he brought a side of prosciutto some garlic dip and a piece of bread nothing like the crostini we have had at the Tatum location Also the veal chop is usually huge and this time it was like half of what I usually get somewhere else Also sadly this still may be an improvement because last time we ordered the Chianti steak here they didn't even believe us it was supposed to come with garlic dip honestly geeezz can't they read their own menus oh well no more Gold Dust in my macaroni ever.
C and R used to provide good service but I can't say that anymore They messed up on changing my bettery never tightened the bolts and I almost stalled in traffic I finally did stall and they told me something else was wrong with the car til it was towed to the shop and they realized it was their mistake Also our rear window was broken and they checked the fuses and charged me $100 to rip apart our back door Onlt to tell me that the mechanism is broken and it'll be $850 to replaceoddly enough my husband fiddled with the wires and its as good as newDo NOT give them your businesshorrible in everyway.
Unfortunately this place has shut down for good and i'm not exactly sure why Could it be for health code reasons just like EFS was shut down If anyone knows please chime in.
I would give tk zero stars if I could They put on a party for st pattys day A complete mess Extra help walking around doing nothing No service no food and no drinks If you have a complaint keep it to yourself They don't wanna hear it Table was supposed to be 30 minutes After an hour of asking and waiting patiently I realized the hostess clearly did not care And it was not that crowded I will not be back No reason to deal with the garbage for sub par food.
Haven't had a margarita this bad since my only visit to Salty Senorita Ordered 2 Palomas which call for fresh squeezed lime and grapefruit juice When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit sodaWhat Total sour belly result and $28 later a lesson learned Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home.
Responded to a promotion of theirs that excluded "holidays"  This was Dec 24 which is the day BEFORE a holiday yet they refused to honor the promotion on the basis that Dec 24 is a holiday  Had to wait for a table even though there seemed to be plenty available  Service was slow and the food was mediocre plus they forgot my side dish  Very disappointing because we had heard such good things about this place.
This USED to be my favorite restaurant I've introduced my mom my boyfriend a few friends and cousins to this place because I am absolutely in love with the Mediterranean Wrap with cashew cheese Yum And the salad that you can order with it delicious After my meal I would usually order the vegan Tiramisu which by the way also delicious Never had a bad experience Today after shopping I decided to stop by to get a table I was mainly going for the Tiramisu and some almond chai I came in and stood there for a while a few people were behind the counter nobody acknowledged me I finally approached the guy by the cash register and asked him if they had the Tiramisu he just said "If you don't see it then we don't have it" I looked some more didn't see it I then asked if he maybe knew when they would have it he just said "No I don't know" And I continued standing there he just then walked away How awkward and so rude I can't say I am mad or angry I am just EXTREMELY sad and disappointed because I have introduced so many people to this restaurant and have always educated people the benefits of eating there and I felt so shut down I mean even if they didn't have the Tiramisu (which is fine) I would have still loved a table for some drinks and maybe another dessert Ugh I cannot believe I let this guy ruin my experience despite how much I love the food the value of the food and the ethics behind the food I am just too embarrassed to go back and I just don't feel comfortable Am so sad and disappointed this was my FAVORITE restaurant :'-(.
Having been regulars for the past 10 years last spring my family and I went to eat there for a celebration We were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so for me I settled for a mushroom burger We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was "helping" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly functioned restaurant.
Not a very good take out experience   We ordered a salad and 3 pasta dishes  Salad was fine but all 3 pasta dishes disappointedPenne San remo was dry   Spaghetti with meat sauce seemingly skipped most of the meat sauce and the Quattro al forno was a tiny portion for $21Would not suggest take out from buca   The price/value relationship is way off.
I stopped at this KFC/Taco Bell on my way home one time and they were out of most of the KFC menu  The drive-thru cashier was rude and very short with me and offered no options for me when each of the first 3 items I tried to order were already sold out  Not going back.
This review is primarily for the Wine Cellar and corporate offices The Cellar-Master is awful arrogant and condescending I've been a long time customer of this and other AJ's throughout the valley and have spent HUNDREDS maybe even thousands of dollars on premium liquor at their stores I've been on the hunt for a particularly hard-to-find liquor even ensuring that my name was added to the running "list" for distribution (I was told I was #3 at one store #2 at another) Long story short I didn't get the bottle I was waiting foreven though both stores received well over 3 bottles each Each time I visit the store or call in to check on the shipment I'm treated like a child and given an eye-roll and sigh for even asking This is ridiculous I'm trying to spend over $300 on booze and I get this kind of customer service TerribleI was offered no explaination as to why I was passed over on the lists instead I was given a "tough luck" and "maybe next year" from the CellarMaster I wrote a long winded complaint letter to corporate a week ago and still have heard nothing back I've even left voicemails with the Managers but haven't received any call back I honestly expected a prompt response with at least an apology but after a week of no response I can't help but bring my frustrations to the public via Yelp Please avoid the wine cellar at this AJ's as best you can and save yourself the frustration of having to deal with an grumpy self-righteous "cellar master".
A married man drives up in a shiny mercedes Benz he's dressed nice and ready to unwind from a hard day at work  He walks right in and directly to the left he knows where he's going: to a booth to watch an adult movie  he selects which one he wants to see and puts his money in  this is what we call an adult arcade  He's playing monkey balls the adult version  The other people walking in just think its a sex shoplube adult toys leather and videos  I went in there with my boyfriend one time and that was the last time  This place gave me the creeps  Walking around the arcade and knowing that there wasn't just one person in the booths guess they were just playing a two player fighting gameI try to keep thinking that to myselfremembering it is just an adult arcade and shoppe  If you're going there for the innocent thrill of buying items to make your love life betteryou're in the right place  Just don't play in the arcadeit's not the kind you're used to as a kid lol  And of course you can't go in without buying somethingI bought a key chain  :p.
This is a copy of the letter I sent to Barro's:Today was the second time I patronized Barro's Pizza in Laveen The first time was last week At that time after getting home I discovered the order was wrong Upon calling the store and speaking to the manager I was given a credit in the amount of the wrong item But only after I told the manager I was not driving back to the store to correct the employe's errorI gave Barro's a second chance and they failed This time I asked for boneless wings with sauce on the side and upon getting home I discovered I was given regular wings and no sauce on the sideI returned to the store this time furious that I gave Barro's two chances and both times my order was wrong I try very hard to patronize local business instead of national chains but in the case of Barro's you have given me no alternativeI will never again patronize Barro's Not here in Laveen not anywhere The store manager Kenny was apologetic and refunded me the cost of the wings and even provided me the correct order I'm sorry but that is not enough I am not looking for any special or extra compensation I simply am telling you that I will never again patronize any of your establishmentsI cannot stress enough how disappointed I am with the lack of service and utter incompetence with this Barro's location I confirmed my order three times with Arial and once with Kenny on the phone and it was still wrong How does something like that happen I can tell you how Kenny was dressed unprofessionally Sneakers and shorts with an un-tucked polo shirt Two of the young ladies working were wearing gang color bandana's on their heads And every employee I saw which was approximately ten had to be under the age of 23 Most of them were probably around 20How does a business expect to thrive when it hires kids who's only concern is to get out of work so they can go play with their friends Why does a business hire kids who have no work ethic and simply do not care about the customers and doing their job rightI understand that for a business such as this the unskilled labor pool you can pull from is mostly just high school and college kids but that is no excuse for the horrible job they do I am sending this as a message and not posting it on your page so as to not publicly embarrass you On the other hand you could just simply delete any post that is placed hereAdditionally there is no link I can find on your web site to leave feedback I wonder why that isRest assured that in addition to me never again patronizing Barro's I will do everything possible to ensure that none of my friends ever do either.
I still haven't been back - from reading the reviews not much better.
"Been there - done that" with this discrepant racket  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service in a blatant word - SUCKS  First they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners  That car washing cost me nearly $300  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity  Then in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled  Nice  Of course Danny's Car Wash was not responsible  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact  But you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm  The car was "For Sale" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant  He assured me it was "No problem  We'll get you all taken care of"  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders  When I pressed the issue he suggested I to speak to the manager  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found  The manager appeared  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing   I know sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway  If I could deduct stars from this business I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash  Check out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous  Inexpensive  Excellent customer service.
We have ended up at this buffet a couple of times because it was in the area  However the customer service is terrible everytime  It is way over priced for the quality of their food  We are never satisfied when we leave this place.
"Why am I here" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded very poorly chosen location I've thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size live music and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks) But after considering all of these positives I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location I can't help but to think that World of Beer Inc saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern Four Peaks Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others) and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find It should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse At least I hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate Outback crew If you really are in to craft beer support your local proprietors.
I was hoping this restaurant would be better The biggest problem with this restaurant was the service  We ordered three dishes and a soup as an appetizer I had eaten there once before and wanted to give the restaurant one more try before I gave an opinion The soups tended to be somewhat bland Also we ordered the sizzling rice soup We had to serve the soup ourselves after a bowl was placed on the table The rice was anything but sizzling We also had a problem with one dish being VERY SALTY  We complained to our waiter and she removed the dish as requested Unfortunately we were still charged for this dish and no accommodations were made to correct our complaints The atmosphere is fun and hip but the service will make me not go back to this restaurant I hope they higher more professional accommodating servers.
The store is dirty but much worse the folks at the registers seem to be trained to be rude and have the social skills of a grocery bag  I live less than a mile away and was excited to find a Sprouts in my new neighborhood  After the first few times there I stopped going and drive well past this store to others  Recently I needed some organic tomatoes quickly and so I thought I would give this Sprouts another try The girl behind the register never spoke to me and seemed as if it was a real inconvenience to ring up four tomatoes She practically threw my change and receipt at me  Never again  Five or six times of poor service is enough.
What a great concept MFF is I ate the food at the Scottsdale location on and off for about a year Not everyday but frequently enough to say I was a regular The menu never changed and I was ok with that - healthy food comes at a cost and it doesn't always taste great The results are what matterAfter a year I was so burnt out I could no longer force the bland meals down I had a few favorites that I would come back to but overall there wasn't much change Then I went to MFF in Southlake Texas this past Christmas The meals were great and I was excited that they changed the menu and added some new items Fast forward to this week I had some of those same new items at the Scottsdale location The Pork Tacos were so tough fatty and overcooked that I threw away the whole meal Angry The corn tortillas are rock hard after you microwave them Absolutely pathetic food I was also disappointed that the breakfast staple "Good Morning Sunshine" had been changed She told me they now add tomato sauce to the ground turkey Terrible idea I've decided that the chefs at the Scottsdale location use low quality ingredients and don't cook up to the standard of other MFF locations Time to try Sunfare here in AZ.
I really liked the food here at first I also love that they deliver serve espresso drinks and have a relatively friendly staff Actually a GREAT staff with wonderful customer service and the genuine attitude of a local business that cares about their customers However it is hit or miss because they seem to have a girl answering phones and taking orders who is a COMPLETE IDIOT Not only is she an idiot but she lacks any sense of customer service and has a very bitchy "what do you want" kind of attitude with people To call her mentally challenged would be an insult to the mentally challenged seeing as I have dined there twice and seem to know a great deal more about the restaurant and the services they provide than this bimbo I took two stars off JUST for her and if she is working or answering the phone when I come in I will take my business elsewhere***Edit: After I received a friendly message from the owner apologizing and offering a free meal (which I have yet to accept and probably never will) I returned because I liked the food so much and wanted to share the fun environment with a guest Both of the girls working treated me heinously from the instant we approached the counter Perhaps they had seen this review and recognized me or perhaps they just have impossibly terrible manners and attitudes Either way they do not seem like friendly people who understand that customers are supposedly to be treated with respect Although the owner seems to be a wonderfully dedicated and kind person I cannot give anything higher than 1-star after the way I have been treated I am not a very resilient person I am emotionally sensitive My feelings were hurt to be treated that way especially after the several crappy experiences that I had prior To be perfectly clear even though I did not feel good about the way I was treated I never went out of my way to make those girls feel bad about how poorly they were behaving while they were being paid to do so and I truly feel that their actions are entirely unjustified Ideally they would also be held responsible as unlikely as this is Also please note that most of the negative reviews about the staff have been flagged meaning someone who works there is fully aware of the problem and refuses to do a single thing about it Just wow.
Have to give one star to post but doesn' deserve that high a rating Avoid this dealership for service I placed three calls to the service department with no return calls Obviously they are not in need of business Was completely satisfied with service by Larry Miller Hyundai in Peoria Will use that service from now on.
I new this place sucked from the last time I ate here but for some odd reason I was tempted to eat here again well I was right it still sucks I had a hankering for spagetti and meatballs first I will say the sauce was watery and had very little flavor the meat balls tasted like a lot of filler and also had a strange flavor the bread stick was ok .
Since the current ownership has been here my apt has been entered illegally on multiple occasions Their maint staff appears to be quite incompetent as they operate outside of the context of the law and have violated my rights as a tenant in order to "fix" things that they could not manage to fix in what has now been more than 60 days and countingYeah Alanza is a cool place to live because of its prime location but when my privacy  and rights are being violated I can't rate higher than one star  I will state that rashonda had been particularly outgoing in her efforts to take control of the chaos that has been my recent experiences here But I am infuriated with being a prisoner to illegal entry of my apt and I will not let these occurrences go unpunished with out a satisfactory resolution or legal action.
We just moved back into the hood from Anthem and man what a BUMMER this Safeway is I LOVE LOVE LVE LVE LEV LOVE LOOOOVE Safeway I will drive any distance to shop at a Safeway - what a bummer this is only 1/2 a mile from my house Went last night and was utterly appalled at the mess of a store I walked into The aisles were a disaster - product was thrown everywhere or was completely out I thought this was a grocery store A place to buy FOODOne checkout line open and a miserable employee ringing If I wasn't in the middle of baking dessert at home I would have tossed the ingredients I needed back on the shelves and gotten the hell outta there Thank GOD the Safeway on Osborn is only a short ride away.
This review is to all parents Papago Park is going to crap What happened to Papago over the past few months Maybe since it is summer the city's staff isn't taking as good of care of the grounds as they should but there was dangerous broken playground equipment all kinds of trash in the sand and the general upkeep of the playground was horrible BTW: I just have to say Papago park gave me the creeps today It was completely empty other than a few shady guys in the parking lot that I am pretty sure were doing a drug deal I wont be going to Papago Park again I like to hike there (just N of McDowell) but I don't feel this park is a safe place for my kids to go and play anymore.
$650 for a 6 oz glass of 'house wine' $9 for a 9 oz glass & $15 for a pasta dish  No thanks.
The crossroads of bad food and worse service Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out The rest of the food was cold The server was never to be found We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server Don't waste your time or money here Your better off eating fast food.
Where do I been  I called in a to-go order and had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie the manager  For a manager Ronnie was rude and has very poor customer service skills  We over looked her behavior and decided to order anyway because we had received good service in the past and everyone is entitled to a bad day   To our surprise some of the order was wrong The pork noodle soup came with chicken instead of pork  Not what we ordered but we could live with other white meat  We also ordered Kung Pao Chicken one with peanuts and one without (the one supposedly without nuts was clearly marked "NO PEANUTS")  Thank God the person that she was sharing the Kung Pao Chicken with who is deathly allergic to nuts did not fix her plate first (Peanut allergies can be life threatening)  We called Siu Wok to complain I again had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie and her poor customer service skill  First she said there was no way the Kung Pao Chicken had peanuts because they where cooked in two different pans This of course was not the case Ronnie did not offer any solutions  I had to request she replace our order with the correct food  Sadly when the delivery guy came back with our corrected order his attitude was just as bad as Ronnie's  I asked to speak with Ronnie's manager  I am still waiting on that call  All I have to say is eating at Sui Woks can be deadly  We will never order from there again.
Was forgotten on the smaller patio and asked to switch to mich v mich st football game and after 15 mins and asking  3 times it did not happen.
So it's no surprise to me to find this has closed With management so inattentive to customers and obviously not business savvy it's no surprise another statistic added to the number of failed startups No great loss here.
SO DISAPPOINTED  Stopped in on a Monday night we were one of 5 tables My first impression was the staff could care less if me and my family were in there or not My kids were excited with their "build your own burger" so we went in Waitress forgot our appetizer the build your own burger wasnt anything bigger than a McDonalds hamburger (good enough for my kids tho)I ordered a ceasar salad which came with NO DRESSING Waitress only came back to give us the bill No check back no drink refills no "how is everything"Just another bar on Mill Ave passing the time until Friday and Saturday Keep walking if your looking for a place to eat This might be good for bar hopping just not to eat.
Well pretty disappointed that they would not honor a gift certificate I have (it was quite expired I understand that but circumstances out of my control prevented me from using it previously)  My friend purchased an hour and a half massage for me so you know that wasn't cheap  Called today and they are unwilling to honor it since it's expired  I might even understand if it was under new management/ownership so they could explain that the money paid previously was not in their pocket but that isn't the case  They got the money and they lost out on a potential new client  I'm pregnant and have been looking for a place to get regular pre-natal massages but this will definitely not be my place  I work in marketing for a similar client-focused industry and we would NEVER turn down a potential new client even if their gift card/coupon was expired  Just bad business but they got the money and clearly don't care.
Absolutely terrible  First glance says cool hip trendy etc but these people have little or no knowledge  They are snobs and they don't respond well if you are not satisfied  If you want to spend way too much and get way too little go to Sassy Glasses.
I REALLY want to like this place which is why I came back on a Sunday The barista was nice and friendly that isn't so much the problem Here are the problems1 They have been playing the same terrible song for two hours No joke I'm not sure if this is a psych experiment or a cruel joke but either way- holy @$%2 I must have missed the sign saying "Burn-outs" welcome & preferred This is the oddest group of people ever During the course of my visit some random guy tried to "save" a really nice man who happens to be blind Along with that the man kept yelling to the counter "Did ya'll forget me" Answer- yes He ordered breakfast and bacon 40 minutes earlier YikesSo I cannot recommend this spot unless you like torture or you are a psych major and need to study some weirdos Bring your DSM -IV and have a great time.
The ONLY thing I like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchenUnfriendly bartenderS two of them food is ok but let's not go crazy here it's not great  Just another "institiution" that gets a free pass becauseI don't know why they get a free passThe red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt so are the waitresses  Just so mediocre  So many other places to go.
What a rip-off After looking on line at times and prices I bought 5 tickets to bring my kids here They say that the park opens at 10am but that is just mini golf Rides don't open until 5pm We wasted an hour drive and $150 to not be able to go on any rides.
Do not go here unless you don't really care if your nails look nice Very inconsistent rushed jobs Every single time I've gone I've had some reason to not go back Today I went again and again inconsistently bad overall services from everyone in that place Find somewhere else to go so you won't leave there every time disappointed and irritatedlike I do.
I had a friend who worked here so I use to get my hair done with her After she left I have tried going back a few times but I always have a bad experience The last time I had a pink streak put in my hair and I was told it would cost $20 At the end she charged me $80 It was ridiculous and I'm never going back again.
Horrible food Vomiting now  Salsa nasty your better off buying dalsa from a jar Restaurant looks dirty menus dirty and sticky 1 taco for 485  Food was just nasty Definitely not authentic in any way Taco bell has better food and im not even a taco bell person Save your money dont go here.
This agent and team is the worst they don't do what you ask them to do The staff is less than helpful and they behave in a dishonest manner I asked the office to do a specific task and I had to call their corporate number all to get a policy cancelled They in turn have lost all my business to another carrier.
I thought I would try out this location big mistake First parking is a nightmare Second I sat inside first and went unnoticed for 10 minutes Then a fight broke out so I moved to the outside bar where there was no bartender Twenty minutes in I was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if I wanted a beer a 3 dollar pbr wasn't bad so I figured why not I felt completely ignored for 30 minutes  will never come back I'm halfway through my pbr and can't wait finish it so I can leave.
I wish I would have read these reviews before going to Dee's I have always gone to Barry's Capezio in Scottsdale for the past 14 years and decided to go to Dee's because they can put taps on the shoes right in the store Wellbig mistake The taps were uneven on each shoe and I felt a screw inside My director/choreographer (who I sent there to buy his taps) told me to bring them back for an adjustment So I dropped them off  and when I came back I still felt a screw inside the shoe And so did the girl who worked there They said I had to call the owner in the morning So I left the shoes there again and called the next morning and I was being very nice and apologetic because I knew his dad was ill Here I was apologizing for not being satisfied and instead of saying he's sorry I had to come back 3 times he yelled at me saying 'I don't have time for this" and hung up So I went to pick them up after work and I got home and tried them on I still feel the screw and the right shoe doesn't tap when I tap the front of my foot I had just spent almost 30000 there within 5 days on another pair of dance shoes as well Block split sole characters for almost 100 bucks plus i sent a bunch of others to buy their items for our production We will NEVER go back I don't know what to do now I can't tap in these Maybe I'll see what Barry's Capezio says All this money wasted.
Twin lobsters were soggy and not done Waiter was awful and took forever to get served Hope landrys chain doesn't screw up others in Scottsdale.
Went there for the first time last week at the suggestion of the person I was meeting  She got there early and had a salad before I arrived  When I arrived she said it was not very good and didn't recommend the food so I just got iced tea and a muffin which was good  My friend went up to get me a refill and told the person that her salad was not good  His answer "sorry" and that was it  He also told her he would have to charge her for another iced tea  I've never been to a place where they don't give you free iced tea refills  He had every opportunity to turn the situation around by offering my friend something else or a coupon for next time or not charging me for my tea - but he did none of that  I wouldn't go back and neither would my friend.
Boo on you I think Chipotle has just gone down hill You know what Chipotle feels like to me Pop culturethey coax you in with great deals giving you as much food as you want no complaints they have a "it's all about the customer" feelthey start to take over in popularity everyone loves them raves about them: they're healthy they use organic ingredients they are such big burritosbut then a shift starts to take placeemployees start to cut back on the good offers not all stores but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat offand then BAM You're getting charged close to $2 extra for 4 more pieces of meat The extra charge for meat isn't even listed on the menu (but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole) In short they took a great idea watered it down inflated the prices and made their bottom line more important than customer satisfaction Piss on you Chipotle and everything like you.
Tried to eat here Finally ordered after 10 min in a line that barely moved and waited for about 35 min before we asked where our order was They couldn't even find it anywhere It wasn't on the screen or being madenothing Well considering I had other things to do I had to leave Won't be back.
I heard ownership changedand since I was at the cleaners next door my timing seemed right  I have since been advised the ownership did not change only the managementIn entering the NEW front door for Papaya Thai even though the Open sign is on I see no one and hear no one  I walked from the front door to the back but no luck  I picked up the go menu and was just about to leave when I hear a voice  Turning to my right there is an entryway into the Pho restaurant next door  I asked if the Thai restaurant is open and was advised it is I would just have a seat at a table in the Pho restaurantBetween the 32 seats in the Thai restaurant and about 40 in the Pho place plenty of seats  I am the only customer in either oneabout 3 PM on a Monday afternoon  Decorations are subtle everything appears clean Hostess/waitress comes by with an order pad and asks what I would like  I ordered Som Tom no green beans or shrimp (not listed in the menu but I have received one or the other too many times) and Thai hot as it is listed on the menu how I should order  Hostess did not know the Thai name for the papaya salad (she seems to be Chinese)  I pointed at papaya salad on the menu  She wrote down my order and headed to the kitchenI got out my cellphone and proceeded to update on the news of the world  A couple minutes later the waitress called from the kitchen door asking what I would like to drink  I requested water and was served water in a glass with a slice of lime in it  About 10 minutes passed from order to deliveryA properly prepared Som Tom is made up of julienned green papaya garlic fresh tomato palm sugar thai rat chile freshly squeezed lime juice and fish sauce The salad that appeared has the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad  Som Tom does not include cilantro  This version had the green papaya fresh tomato and fish sauce  The chile looked to be red chile from Mexico (the seeds are bigger than thai rat chile) and the zing from the lime was not therePortion size was admirable 2 cups on a lettuce leaf  Still not worth my time.
Terrible That's all there is to it That and the incorrect information they're totally willing to hand out I called and asked if they did eyebrow threading was told that yes they did went in a couple hours later and was promptly told that they didn't do that there and maybe I should check at the mall So I decided to get them waxed anyway When I went to pay the woman told me the waxing was 8 dollars Then after running my card and handing me a receipt she told me about the 2 dollar charge for using a card Which was something that would have been nice to know before she ran the card in the first placeWould not go back or recommend.
Gross This tastes nothing like Mexican food Tastes like they heated up some Jose Ole in the micro Never going back I didn't even pay for this meal and I can't think of one good thing to say about this place.
I don't know what is going on with this location but it is bad Very dirty stacks of dirty dishes piled up in the middle of the dinning room My pasta came burnt (crispy noodles) yuck We went for lunch and there was only a few people there Makes me wonder where all the dirty dishes came from and how long they had been sitting there Skip this place for sure.
If you want your order to be correct call another franchise They do not listen forget to include the additional items in the delivery but NEVER forget to charge you for them We ordered 2 Pizzones only one came then the "manager" (I'll use the term loosely) gave us attitude when we called back to complain She had the Pizzone redelivered AN HOUR LATER without so much as an apology I hate hate hate this Pizza Hut.
We were staying in Chandler AZ and saw this restaurant across the street from our hotel   So we tried it out for dinner and what a mistakeFirst off  we ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was shared between the two of us    After drinking the $20 pitcher we came to the conclusion that there must have been about one shot of tequila in the whole thing I ordered the Steak fajita taco salad  That was my second mistake- well I guess third mistake if you count walking in the door to the place  This Steak fajita taco salad was a disgusting fried shell with a small amount of steak and onions in the bottom covered by about five inches of old dry lettuce     When it arrived at the table the bottom portion was just a nasty juicy mess that could barely be eaten The juice was not any sort of sauce It must have been the oil that the steak and onions were cooked in    The part of the shell that was not submerged in this grease even tasted like very old frying oil and nothing else  My girlfriend had the spinach enchilada dinner  There was no taste of spinach in this enchilada  All of the taste was some spice that they had went overboard with  We like spicy things but this was not a good thing  It seems that the Mexican restaurants around here do not re-fry their beans which is fine   These beans in particular tasted like absolutely nothing-  which may have been for the better  The only thing edible on the plate was the riceIt's a good thing I live in Illinois so I don't have to look at this pace again    I really feel ripped off     You can't even count on your $20 worth of margaritas to have enough alcohol to make the food seem good.
my husband and i have gone here several times and either the steaks are not cooked right or service is horrible last time we went we were about 15th on the waiting list with 4 tables available in the bar I asked if they are going to seat those tables and were told no one wanted the bar i told they we would take one there I was told we had to wait until our name was called because we had to wait our turn even though no one wanted them After 1/2 hr we left and went to famous daves thank goodness they really like their customersI wrote the corp office only to be lied to I was called by a manager in tenn and told that doug the district manager would call me in which he never did and that was a month ago I was also told they were sending us out a gift card in hopes we would return hahaha nope why would anyone give logans roadhouse a dime when even the corp office could care less about their customers pls go somewhere else daves charlestons texas roadhouse waldos in mesa Pls to not give logans a dimeSince i have written this Doug the district manager called and said he is going to make good and this is not how Logans is to run their stores so time will tell.
Wish I'd yelped before agreeing to eat here Pseudo Japanese "food" made with generic untasty ingredients Be prepared to use a LOT of soy sauce.
As a 3-year patron of the Happy Valley Mellow Mushroom I never missed an opportunity to rave about the place  When this location opened just 5 minutes from my house I thought for sure it was a gift from God  However after 3 visits I will never be returning to this restaurant and will happily make the longer trek to Happy Valley where I know I will leave satisfiedOur first visit was 2 hours long  Not by our choosing  Not only did it take them over 30 minutes to get us our drinks (a water and a coke) but then an hour to get our meals  And my husband's meal was wrong they offered to make him the pizza he really ordered and we obliged  Had we known it would take them another hour to make the freakin thing we would have said no thanks  This was only a few weeks after they had opened so we thought that maybe it was because they were still getting their bearings and didn't realize how busy they would be (even though the place was empty)  So we gave them another shotThe next time we got take out pizza from them  It was cold but I suppose I can't blame them for that  This visit is not the reason I am writing this reviewThe last straw occurred last week on Wednesday October 10th  I had family in town my sister and 1 year old niece and we brought our 2 month old son to dinner as well  The 5 of us requested to sit outside because it was just plain gorgeous out  We arrived before 7pm  Upon going outside I immediately was hit with the smell of cigarettes so I tried to pick a table that seemed to be further away from the smell thinking it was just some passers by outside the restaurant  I unknowingly had chosen a table closer to a table where a few men were smoking  Now I was under the impression that smoking was no longer allowed in restaurantsI didn't think this was new news  My husband politely asked the server what their policy was on smoking and she said after 10pm they allowed it  (Which I still think is bull)  Since it was well before 10pm she asked the men to move  They stepped just outside the bar area and the lovely draft made the stench even worse but we couldn't complain since they weren't technically in the restaurant anymoreOur food arrived and it was good but our conversation kept getting interrupted by some loud people who turned out to actually be servers who kept going over to the smoking table and socializing with the men who were also servers  I discovered this because when the men left the table it was shortly reoccupied by two female servers on their breaks who promptly lit up as well  Not only is this illegal but with two babies nearby it is extremely inconsiderateWhen we left we were all very disappointed and embarrassed because we had raved so much about this place to my guest and it was such a terrible experience  My husband went in and asked for a manager unfortunately he didn't ask her name but he had the sneaking suspicion that she was not actually a manager but a server pretending to be a manager  He asked this person what their policy was on smoking and she said they allowed it "on the ends but not in the middle"  What the heck kind of smoking policy is that and why were we told something different before  We will NEVER be going back to this location and I suggest that unless your favorite pizza condiment is second hand smoke you don't go here either.
I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great the service is absolutely terrible I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff They feel that as long as you have a minor issue it is your fault and not theirs For example my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis it is 12:02 PM She serves us full sized martinis My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly and to make sure we were not being charged full priced she flagged the waitress over to which she says "those are full priced martinis" My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds "I didn't hear you" So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials she retaliates and gets defensive Because of her incompetence we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks "What's going on here" oh hi nice to see you too He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude that I have just about had it with that place IT is not the first time I have received this poor service and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's but we're going to have to part waysWhat is a huge turn off of all is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context "servers and waitstaff are rude" I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant please hire new management and waitstaff they are making you look horrible.
I give up  I once loved the food and service here but both have deteriorated to the point of no return  At least my return  Once you get past the lackluster service you get mutter paneer with peas tasting like they just came out of a can and chicken tika masala so bland I didn't ask for cartons for the leftovers  Serving the tika masala at near room temperature didn't do it any favors  Go find Indian Paradise in the airpark while they don't have belly dancers they have cricket on the tv and truly terrific Indian food.
I don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the Deer Valley Airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board  The buffet is just kinda gross  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry  It's just kinda gross  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right  The lasagna was good but not worth revisiting this place for  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok but may have given me the shits) fried shrimp (bleh) fried chicken (ok) their soups (weren't very good) chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting) rice pudding (barely ok)  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit)Oh and not a fan of their salad bar either really  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me) but I'll never be coming back.
If I could give negative stars I would One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars After being cited by Phoenix PD he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible Later after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices.
FailBurgerAs i said in my review of Delux I'm still looking for a great burger place in central phx  This place let me down  Not that the food was terrible but it was just mediocre  First of all I had to wait for a table Usually a good sign  The waitress was about 16 she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions  The waitstaff bus their own tables so it takes longer to turn them  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section  TerriblePeople sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere lets calm down mmmkay  Thanks  This place blows a hole  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss  Bloom is a miss True Food is a Hit ZinBurger is a miss Sauce is a hit  etc etc etc  If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers grab one to go and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store just pick one with the coolest label  Same result.
There are much better and cheaper options for gyms in the tempe area  My biggest complaints are the lack of cleanliness and the overall condition The lobby and general areas all look nice but I've often found the locker rooms to be dirty Additionally the cardio machines are often sticky and sweaty GrossOn the plus side the pool is great and it's large enough that finding a machine isn't a problem My biggest complaint has come after I cancelled my membership I get almost weekly calls letters and emails asking me to re-join I've asked to be removed from their mailing list but it doesn't seem to work Somehow the message of "Leave me alone I'm happy with my new gym" isn't getting through.
i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  650  he brought it to my table and left and returned to the back of the restaurant when i finished i went to the front desk he seamed ancious to cash me out but i ordered a side of pot stickers he brought those out and set them on the table as my glass of water was empty he never offered to re fill it  it is now noon and the place is still empty NOT A SOUL hmmmm I finished the pot stickers which were weak at best went and paid a rediculous 1200$ oh all right 11 and change  never the less i left no tipyou think  boy is this person really in the restaurant business.
Good place to take your young out-of-town guests to show you're still hip Not a good place for us senior citizens The music is so loud as to be painful The staff are disdainful of older folk The food is strange hard core healthy Might be good spot to cure a hangover.
Service and staff were great Very friendly and accommodating However The food was awful The atmosphere was "OK" for the prices I expected a Lil more elegant space From the outside it seems upscale on the inside it feels like a comfortable dive type bar Seems as though they're trying to create an upscale menu for "Scottsdale" but falls short in atmosphere location and food The fish was a small portion and a bit over cooked the burger had a burnt grill taste and no mayo in the building and the Fries were WAAAAY overdone When  we asked about it they said they were supposed to be that way double fried :/ Yuck and completely Inedible Few beers on tap and the four peaks beers come in a CAN and it was Gross Possibly there are other items on the menu that would be better But We are unwilling to give them another try at those prices My suggestion is don't waste your money there are better options in Scottsdale for price atmosphere and comfort ability.
Please refer to my attached photo for why the Scottsdale Quarter gets ONE star for my review HALF of the entire parking garage was reserved for Valet parking on a Tuesday night at 8:00pm  And all the spots were empty Don't get me wrong I don't mind parking far away and walking or even parking valet but I was just "stopping in" to grab some froyo at Menchies The walk to and from my car took longer than it took me to get the Frozen Yogurt  What's the point of having a parking garage if it's completely empty and reserved for valet parking Its no wonder the Oakville Grocery closed there was probably nowhere for the customers to park  I wouldn't be surprised if other businesses close as a result of this horrendous parking situation.
I have been to Chompie's many times and have never been thrilled However after our last visit I will NEVER return I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant as I was at this location last Sunday morning We were quoted a 20 minute wait Even with a 1 year old child we thought we would give it a shot After waiting for 45 minutes I went up to see what the delay was as they had seated many people who came in after us before us They were working for of 3 seperate handwritten lists and had NO comprehensive system (And this was one of the MANAGERS) When I asked when we would be seated she practically yelled at me and told me she had no idea Seriously Needless to say we left NEVER AGAIN.
The rude front desk staff is enough to make me not ever come back again The older receptionist actually followed me back to my chair to argue with me after we came to an agreement and I smiled said thank you and walked back to where I was sitting She stood over me and proceeded to argue her point which was that she can be more than 15 minutes late with my appointment but I can't be more than 9 Oh yeah she forgot to mention she had two other wax technicians in the back not currently doing anything That location is a franchise and the owner was supposed to call me back months ago regarding the altercation Needless to say my business is gone for good.
1 star is too much to give this place as a review I was super excited to start my membership here and that quickly turned to disappointment My main complaint with this gym is there lack of policy for cutting locks off the lockers at night I can come into the gym at 2 in the afternoon with no one working out or in any classes and I'm lucky to find even one available locker People feel it necessary to lock their dirty stuff in the lockers over night and take up space for other members When asking the front desk what my options were they said i could pay an additional 25$ a month for a dedicated locker (people are getting them for free when they lock their lock all month) or i could place my bag with the front dest people to watch I've tried many times to get in touch with the manager Anthony i believe and have yet to receive a returned phone call or have yet to catch this guy while he's working to complain in person Called today again to ask for a solution to people abusing the locker system and was grilled but the preteen girl on the phone on asking the EXACT purpose i was calling rather than just taking my reason for calling as a complaint about the gym and keeping it at that I pay more more money each month to come to this gym over my old 24 hour fitness contract and drive way the hell downtown to use this facility The bi weekly payment schedule is a joke too seems all fine and dandy till you do the math and it comes out to about 43 a month after everything is said and done The lack of mirrors is annoying especially when you're trying to watch your formOver all i would give this place a half of a star because esthetically its pleasing but thats about it.
Golden Spoon has an amazing product It's truly the ice cream lover's froyo The yogurt is creamy flavorful and relatively nutritious The staff are also consistently friendly and helpful Why the one star rating  On a mission to satiate my cinnamon yogurt craving last weekend I stopped by the Shea location Some yogurt melted on my fingers while sampling--no biggie I'd just run to the restroom While drying my hands I glimpsed some movement out of the corner of my eye so I took a closer look  I'd like to refrain from naming the baby bugs I saw darting around I think we all know what bug is associated with perpetual infestation  No I'm not referring to termites or ants Heart rate elevated I took a brisk walk out to the front of the store Passing the garbage can directly adjacent to the yogurt machines I spotted the one of the adult culprit(s) just chilling out and enjoying life I absorbed my surroundings:  the yogurt machines were covered in what looked like several days' worth of melted froyo the floor was in dire need of a proper cleaning and the front doors were propped open There's nothing like the smell of delicious sugary froyo wafting out the door to invite some more "friends" into the place I immediately emailed the owner of this location but I have yet to hear from him/her I can't believe I actually went though with that purchase My stomach lurches every time I think about having a taste After this experience I will never go back Ever.
Sometimes you have to go to Walmart because they have everything and man do I hate coming here This has to be the worst Walmart I've been too It's always packed and always dirty I've gone on 3 different occasions and they were out of carts wtf Also they have a very dim lit parking lot and there are shady characters hanging out there at night near the gardening section Does this place have security or loss prevention because I've never seen them Avoid this place if possiblePros: It's Walmart it has everythingCons: Dirty crowded no security dark parking lots shady characters hanging out no carts.
Worst panda I've been to little food and stale they charged me a dollar for a shrimp item just to find out there was only 3 shrimps and the rest vegetables and it was rubbery disgusting.
So I visited this LA Fitness on a guest pass to see how I liked the facility Thank God I never paid anything to go there When I showed my guest pass I had to present it to a young kid sitting at a desk who said he'd take my driver's license that day as an exchange and I'd just have to get it from him when I was done with my class I thought it was weird that I didn't actually get an official pass but whatever So I return the next day and of course it was an issue Not only that the GM basically reprimanded me for something his own worker failed to do AND called me a liar When I produced my guest pass on my phone he annoyingly tossed it back at me When he asked why I didn't have a membership already I told him that I kinda work at a fitness studio He insulted my place of work by saying he had never heard of it Obviously he hasn't it's a women's only dance studio Then he preceded to pitch me membership options and tell me about his son that is going to be a big rapper Really I never returned to finish my 9 days left of my guest pass even that wasn't worth it Just the fact that LA Fitness employs complete degenerates to run one of their locations doesn't bode well for the company itself And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed well I'm not sure I trust LA Fitness at allAs for the 2 classes that I took they were ok but the mats that they provide are ridiculous - they're clearly not cleaned and most of them are ripped apart.
I had the basic car wash today The plastic scratched the hood and trunk of my car It also dropped chemicals which took paint off mycar I took pictures I called and left a message I hope some one cares.
I came into town for a show and was excited to try a gluten free friendly restaurant I could have not been more disappointed Since I notice most reviews of this place are very positive and extremely long I'll try to be direct and to the point Service was incredibly slow We waited a long time for food and to pay our bill I noticed everyone waiting a long time for their food and when stuff came out it was in odd bursts Atmosphere was some what pretentious and for the food I ate not at all warrantedFood was uninteresting and mediocre I ordered the grass fed burger medium rare on a gluten free bun The burger was preformed and nowhere near medium rare  They way this place markets itself I was expecting something fresh and well prepared Instead I got something I'm pretty sure had been frozen in the shape in which it was cooked and brought to me I wouldn't be surprised if the whole meal was cooked in a microwave The bun was gluten free bread which is okay someplace that doesn't use the word bun on their menu My friend's pizza we also compared to frozen pizza cooked in a microwaveI love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge This place failed for me in every possible way except in cleanliness But if you told me they were cooking frozen food in a microwave in the apartment next door and then bringing it over I wouldn't be the least surprised.
I revoked my wife's dinner picking privledges after she chose this place This place is clean and means well with the 'organic' and 'green' stuff but that does not make up for the complete lack of quality and flavor in this food First they use Boylan soda products that are beyond disgusting There is a reason that most places use Coke and Pepsi products My diet cola tasted like the smell of bandaids  Second We got the breadsticks with marinara for an appetizer and they were small hard and flavorless bread brushed slightly with oil  Thrid They didn't write our order down and the stuff on our pizza was wrong The pizza was decent size and the pepperoni was thickly sliced which was nice But the sauce was bland and tasted like the sauce from Spaghetti-o's The crust was burnt so much so that my wife and I were having little sword fights with our crust pieces  The staff was super nice and everything but they have some serious issues that will keep us from coming back This place is was overpriced but i guess someone has to pay for the Prius and Smart Car delivery cars.
Stopped by for just a cocktail and to check the place out  The bartender was rude and short with us  After three attempts of trying to figure out what she was saying we got it  We didn't even get a chance to look at the menu as we couldn't finish our cocktails fast enough  There was not a very welcoming atmosphere apparently unless you are a regular and the "smoking patio" is a joke  Because of the non-welcoming atmosphere we won't be back.
I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.
The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service HOWEVER today was a different story I wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it wentactually it didnt go anywherewe walked in and were greeted by a young man when 2 seconds later sam came over and they ignored us and started bickering in front of us Then i told the guy we wanted to sit outside and he had to ask same which i didnt understand why considering the restaurant was nearly empty As we were waiting for him to return another waitress asked if we were being helped and at the point same and the guy were walking back to us bickering Finally we were being taken to the outside seating area when I heard sam mutter something So rude When we were finally seated the table was dirty WTF it wasnt busy so i dont get WHY they had any dirty tables So the guy who seated us was gonna go get a bus boy to clean it we waited for about 10 minutes when tito came and questioned my english First off I dont want to be greeted with "YO" I am not your homeboy second there wasnt enough people for us to be called "y'all" It was annoying so when we told him NO we arent ready to order because our table wasnt cleaned off he told us he was gonna go get someone else to do it At that point we were irritated and just got up and left Looking at most of these reviews I dont understand why management doesnt fix this service issue All you have to do is hire servers that have high school diplomas and BAM problem solved.
This place is ridiculousService is extremely slow and unprofessional I was with 2 friends when their food came out (already very late) the waitress looked at me and realized that my food wasn't even prepared yet 20 minutes later i get most of my meal but the eggs were so undercooked i couldn't eat them I also never got my toast we ordered chocolate milk but instead we received milk with a few drops of Hershey syrup it was not good I will NEVER go back here again EVERAvoid this place by all means.
Honestly some of the worst food and service I have ever had All of the other breakfast places around were long waits so we checked yelp and although it was a risky at 35 there was no wait and everyone was hungry I wasn't expecting a lot given the 35 star rating but sometimes I've found the more ratings taken can be more important than the rating in Yelp Ordered the huge cinnamon roll chicken fried steak and apple juice Apple juice tasted spoiled told the waitress and her response was a pissed off look then asked "Well what else do you want then" (With this start we considered canceling the order and just leaving but we were hungry and unfamiliar with the area so how bad could breakfast be doneBAD as we found out)Cinnamon roll actually tasted decent after I removed the 2 cups of thick icing plopped on top of the rollChicken fried steak was simply nasty Gravy was gross and like the icing on the cinnamon roll was 2 cups of thick bland corn starch filled gravy plopped on the nasty fried steak Like I mentioned earlier I was hungry so I tried to force it down I tried salt pepper and even tried masking the nastiness with tobacco and finally have to give up Eggs 'over easy' were soupy more like sunny side up so it was just bad My wife had French toast and again I would describe the disappointment but you get the point NOTHING was good except for the lady as we walked out gave the kids a dum dum sucker which sums up my visit I was a dum dum for paying and only a sucker would return.
This place is cheesy cheesy "Daryl's OK used cars" type of feel They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once and the end result is a car with water spots I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER If you are a recently paroled felon or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees.
Do NOT eat here  Two of my friends were in town for the PF Chang's half marathon and wanted some post race food before heading on a long drive back home  I pulled the Sandwich Club off of the Yelp iPhone App and it had an 85% rating (so I figured it had to be great)We got there and waded through the huge crowd at the Daily Dose and sat down at an empty patio (one thing should tell you if a place sicks is if there is a long wait at the restaurant next door and NO spill over into the other restaurant)  We got sat right away and were greeted by a waitress who was a major space cadette  She couldn't even tell us what sides came with the sandwichesWe ordered an appetizer of guac and chips ($7) and we got processed guac from a bag and some gross round crappy tortilla chips  That right there set the scene for the rest of the meal  I ordered a grilled cheese that on the menu sounds awesome but when I got it the cheese wasn't even melted  It was just sweaty half warm with more of that crappy guacamole instead of fresh slices of avacado  My friend ordered avacado to go on her BLT and got the same gross guacamole when she commented to the waitress that saying avacado vs gaucamole on the menu was misleading the waitress proceeded to argue with her  This restaurant sucked and for the price and location the food was not worth it.
So Ginger O and I went there for brunch  We were the only ones there and it took probably 30+ minutes to get our food  I got Eggs Benedict which didn't have any hollandaise sauce on it however the waitress gave the excuse that it was the "French" wayummm to say it includes hollandaise sauce then making it invisible on your plate The eggs were over cooked  It was really hot in the restaurant The service was bad took forever for the food and they just didn't seem to care  Then I found out the next day Scratch closed But that is no excuse for the bad service go out with a bangnot a "lame" attitude   Obviously we will not be going back.
Staff  won't respond after 5 emails for the over charging by the Vue for so called damages once the student has moved out Staff  promised to send  all bills paid to there vendors for repair work and the break down between the six students living in the apartment and pictures of all damage Parents be a ware of the Vues billing practicesThey even state they will attach your students or your credit but will not provide the proof requested I would not let my student stay there again.
I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong Not cheap I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 "designer brand" surcharge (no I am not kidding) Despite branding as "green" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience) No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area Be warned.
I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review  When I came here a few weeks ago I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the "too cool to notice you" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer serviceHere are the "highlights" of the night:1  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm2  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes which was not a problem for us3  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore4  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity  Really5  Menus and water brought to the table6  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fiancé who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order  During this time we saw other tables being tended to and waited on7  Walked out of the restaurant  The hostess servers and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fiancé was trying to get someone's attention  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool hipster people there that night  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit.
Mediocre sushi and god-awful service My wife and I both ex-servers from our college years tried them three times Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland Save your money.
We had a Groupon so figured we'd make the trip for a sweet deal on Sushi didn't work out that way We decided on a couple of rolls with macadamia nuts because wellwho doesn't like macadamia nuts Rolls come no nuts Even though it clearly lists them on the menu not one roll has a nut We ask the server about it and she says they don't include nuts on the rolls ( and apparently don't ask if you want them) because of the allergy risk Which assumes people can't read and makes zero sense I noticed you had no issues with the cream cheese what about about the lactose intolerant peopleSo she brings us out a small bowl of stale nuts and we put them on the sushi which ruins it We'd had a couple of bites before we dumped the crappy stale nuts on the sushi so I was ok with paying for it and getting out of the place So I call the issue to the servers attention she says "let me go get my manager" and this "manager" never comes out I was simply looking for some reassurance that the nuts would be thrown out and no else would want to puke on their food but that was too much to ask Paid the bill and left.
It is a great bar IF you are single and have low standards Their brunette bartender Priscilla is the primary reason we longer go there Between her crazy and rude antics and the bar fights amongst the meth heads we have decided that although the bar may be close to home it's just not worth the drive.
The food is mediocre and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options in town Everytime my husband and I go there the service is bad and  the food is majority of the time cold because its been sitting for awhile  I went in this morning and it will for sure be my last time at any good egg I sat at the bar for 20 minutes Four waiters passed by me and  smiled not a "someone will be with you" nothing I was about to walk up to who appeared to be a manager (who also passed me a few times)  but I decided to leave because there was already a precedence to having a bad experience It wasn't till I got up and left when a waiter asked if I was ok I snapped because I was starving and pregnant and I feel bad but that place deserves no business of mine I'm done.
I like Panda Express food but over the last few years their servings have gotten too small We used to get the Panda Feast I say used to because we quit going there all together They used to fill those qt containers until they could barely get them closed now they fill the containers a little over 3/4 full but charg full price This just wasn't happening with one particular server but all of them so I think maybe their managers are telling them to under fill containers I don't know that for sure but what I do know is that I am not particularly fond of getting ripped off so to avoid getting burned we just don't go there anymore.
A little late to the party  I was able to convince my father to get out of this house for what looked to be a great time and great food  What a DISASTER  The prior reviews are dead on  We were so excited to savor the tastings of food trucks but obviously so was the entire population of Scottsdale  Lines lasted for hours trucks ran out of food and everyone was grumpy  Not impressed.
"My wife and I ate there a few weeks back I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible I do how however like ambiance.
Overpriced Stay away  Got charged $350 and they pushed a button to reset my tripped switch  Saw this on 2 FIXIt and thought it would be a good company but read these reviews and STAY AWAY  It's all about money and getting all they can once they get into your home.
This place looked great and has good reviews but I was not impressed with the final product  My sister and I used the groupon and we were excited to have some pampering time  We both got pedicures and they were so sloppy  I give myself a better pedicure than what I received at this place  Even after them cleaning up their mess there still was polish on my toes outside of the nail  Not to mention that the polish chipped in less than a week which is something that never happens when I do my own pedicure They seemed like nice people but overall I was extremely disappointed with the final product and will not recommend this place.
The nicest things that I can say are overpriced lousy salt lick  If you like paying top dollar for lousy service dirty tables greasy silverware overly salty flavorless food then this is the place for you   Even the "world famous" pie was terrible  Save your money and buy a Marie Calendar's pie at the market and if you really want to make it taste like Rock Springs sprinkle a few packets of sugar on it  So much salt and sugar in this restaurant that only bovines should be dining there Nasty shameful If I could give it zero stars I would.
I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house  I have been to various locations around the Valley and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere  This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and serviceSince this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked  Specifically the Chicken Wings it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry The wait staff tells me this is one of the biggest complaints they get  Unfortunately after years of complaints management can't seen to get it rightLook elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings (Wingstop #1 Buffalo Wild Wings #2) or any other Native New Yorker.
I arrived at this Taco Bell at noon   Placed my order at 12:13pm and got my food at 12:33  I came to try the new cool ranch taco and received  regular Doritos taco   When I tried to tell the man (he looked like the manager) who have me my food he said "this looks like yours"  I said "I ordered the cool ranch taco box"  He replied "you want a box"  I said forget it and walked away When I sat down to eat my food it seemed as though it had been sitting for awhile  The bottoms of the tacos were soggy and falling apart and the food was cold  Don't get me wrong I have realistic expectations for fast food at Taco Bell but this was pretty horrible even by those standards.
Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot As far as the place its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.
No starsMy wife and I were looking for something different in Glendale \ Peoria area  Lots of the usual chains here and since we had never been in Firebirds we might as well try it  MistakeIt wasn't that busy and we were told by the door holder (can't call her a hostess since she was no host) said to sit anywhere  We waited 15 minutes just to get the waitress to come take drink orders  Not a good startOur Queso with Chips was cold when it came out  Our meals were bland greasy bar food  My ribs tasted like they were bought from Safeway  And service continued to be ridiculously poorYelp makes me give it a star which it doesn't deserve  Spending $60 for dinner for 2 and having it be this bad an experience deserves no stars  Do not waste your time at this poor excuse for a sports bar  There are many better choices.
My wife brought my dogs to the Peoria location what a nightmare  there she found a Dr lets just say he was scarey  They tried to RIP us OFF for over $1000 My lab was boarded just days before and had dyera and throwing up rather than checking for a Parasite he wanted to run a serus of tests that would run over $700 my other dog had a skin infection he wanted to test in the about $400 my wife walk out in tears took them to anther hospital to find that the lab had a parasite gave him a pill and he's in great shape 1day later These So called Dr are there to take your money and could care less about the Animals they treat Stay away unless you feel like th roughing your money away.
One star because "no stars" is not an optionThis is the exact email I sent to the brewery after leaving this establishment about my "experience" which has yet to be acknowledged :Pretty disappointed by last night's experience Or lack there of We got to the brewery a few minutes before what I was told was our "reservation" time and just shortly after a party of 4 had gotten there I heard the host tell the party that since they did not have a ''reservation" it would be about a 30-40 minute wait The party moved aside to discuss if they wanted to wait or not The host then ignored my husband and I for 5 minutes while she conversed with 3 other employees all who seemed to not have a care in the world When we finally got her attention she found our name on the "reservation" list and informed us it would still be at least 30/45 minutes before we could be sat Now longer than the group who walked in before us that didn't have a "reservation" We have no problem over looking minor service issuesespecially at a new place when dining out but when it comes at the expense of wasting our entire evening that's just inexcusable Why bother taking reservations Scratch that why email me and ask me if I'd like to have a reservation for your establishment if you have no intention of honoring it Sure you maybe thinking "we were going to honor it just 45 minutes late" Which means it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriving at this imaginary table Also 30/45 minutes Lame So I have yet to get a response Forget this small place with crap parking Go to Fate or Angels Trumpet or Sun Up or Phoenix Ale House or Sleepy Dog or Four Peaks or Gordon Biersch or hell drive the hour to Sedona or Pine and visit one of their many breweries All of them will be more than happy to provide you with wonderful beer & food with out a "reservation" Just don't bother here.
Unfortunately yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix The food was sub-awful (seriously a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible) the service was terrible (zero smiles and I had to basically tackle our server get the check much less some refills on water glasses) and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing homeI won't go back Ever.
If I could give this place less than one star I would My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona I jumped at the opportunity BIG MISTAKE We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess She said it would only be about 10 minutes which was fine with us so we waited About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up so we continued to wait However 20 minutes after we were still waiting The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman who I am assuming was the manager After talking to him she finished busing the table Looking around the front room I could see at least 5 open tables However we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order Needless to say after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want not did they deserve our business We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices We will never be back.
We had mother's day brunch and overall this place was a fail  The buffet was $1695/person + tax + 18% gratuity  Over priced  My water glass was refilled only once our dirty plates weren't taken until we asked our silver wasn't replaced and the buffet selection was unimpressive No omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet.
This place is terrible It smells like rotten food and looks old and dirty The woman who runs the shop is rude She will also lie to you about how quickly she can have your clothes ready This happened to me twice and unfortunately I was really depending on her to have my dress ready I will never go back.
Well this is not new york pizza and obviously no one here has ever had NY pizza  Sauce bland crust was wrong and cheese had an odd flavor  Don't say its new york pizza if its not  Just another sub-standard pizza place trying to make a buck off the new york name.
I read below that this restaurant is a great place to take your mom out for breakfast so hey I listened and decided it'd be worth a try My mom and I headed out Sunday morning to grab a nice meal and catch up Well unless your idea of bringing mom out to breakfast is causing her to have an aneurysm then this isn't the place for you Look I'm patient but when I walked into a restaurant and try to simply put my name on the waitlist and get shoved aside by other patrons that's strike 1 When the manager and his five unhelpful staff of chickens run around like their heads are cut off that also worries me Does it really take 6 people to man the front of the restaurant -- and by man I mean disregard customers Glad I walked out before being sat down because I'm sure the kitchen is in as much disarray as the entrance.
Went today Not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles lettuce etc all the garnishments That alone took a good 5 mins Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold Also the friesThen they called us up I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over itBurgers were cold fries were cold Had to send it all back UNREALI have been to Joes at LEAST 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been HORRIBLESo disappointing This place used to be great.
I can't rate this place because it's not there they moved miles down the road to a different location who knows how long ago  yelp won't let me give zero stars for a non-existent place.
I cannot believe what I was served here I ordered the mini Chimis The chicken ones were ok but a little plain The beef ones on the other hand were freaking MOLDY I can't freaking believe it I was very upset It seems as though I am not going to get sick from this (its been about 10 hours since I ate there and I feel fine) The waiter was nice and comped us the meal.
Rental car review118 degrees  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses  Finally a bus  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminalPHXpay attention  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.
I purchased two groupons for this place as it sounded very much like Chipotle which I love  My friends and I went in there last night for two salads  The salad bowls are half the size of Chipotle the meat is cut so small that it looks like hamburger  I asked for brown rice and the guy tried to give me pinto beans (I told him 3 times that is not rice - those are beans)  Brown rice is not even available  They pride themselves on a peri peri marinade but the meat had zero flavor actually everything was bland no flavor  The cook was busy tossing chips (supposed to be in a bowl) but they landed all over the floor and he just looked at them  The cashier was nice friendly and seemed to be the only one of the two employees working  He dished up the food rung people up replaced forks etc while the cook was on his cell phone complaining about other employees / managers  The bar area had a decent sized TV but it was turned off  The restaurant has a bar area that would be great to sit and surf the net on WiFi but it is not available  The cook's laptop and newspapers were spread all over the counter leaving no room for customersThe whole time we were there maybe 10 people came in  Several came in and leftThe music was ok but a bit loud for concrete floors and high ceilings as it echoed and seemed much louder  I don't want to return there let alone use my other groupon  I'll contact Groupon to see if that can be refunded.
Worst customer service I have ever experienced (only go if your a male) The two women who were working were gossiping about hooking up with men while cutting these two children's hair I told her I wanted a few high lighs to freshen my look for a wedding That I was trying to get my hair healthy so I dont want a bunch The woman was not friendly at all but i figured oh well its Supercuts Once she finished putting highlights in I was spun around and saw she had put tons of right lights in She announced it would be 85 dollars I told her I would not pay That if I wanted a 85 dollar color job I would have gone to my regular salon She told me to go to the sink Rinsed my hair aggressively and told me to leave Refusing to give me a towel and in front of other customers just said ok leave Will never go back Thought I would save a few dollars and get 4-5 high lights before a wedding Ended up spending 160 to get my tye-dyed hair fixed the next morning and missed my best friends wedding rehearsal RUDE salon Just pay 85 and go to a nice salon that will pamper you.
Me & my girl went to see a movie we missed out earlier and $3 was def appealing After we entered we felt it wasn't as bad as we would have thought but once we sat and after 15 mins we started itching on our backsBUGS Warning : this theater has bugs and tons of themwe came home and had to clean out our stuff feeling paranoidi guess what would you rather have$3 fun or bugs in your houseDef no for clean freaks .
One of the worst KFC's in the country  Always getting short changed on the cole slaw   6 piece bucket had a back bone as one of the pieces  Previous orders were never right   Buy at another location and not this one  We're moving and hope the KFC is better  Eat something else  Will not be going back and will buy our chicken up in the valley.
We got seated quickly but waited 15min to place our drink order In the meantime a group got seated next to us they were greeted them follewed by another server telling th about their "team service" Too bad we didn't get any of that team service' We ordered the crab crusted tilipia they forgot the broccoli (and when they bring it it tasted like rubber) the dish was disappointing They were nice enough to take it off the bill Overall the service was poor and food was sub par I hadn't been to Red Lobster is some years and not I remeber why Next time I'm in that area i'lll choose to go elsewhere.
Lost my pants from 3pc suit Great  Oh i'm sorry  Here's a hundred bucks  Go find some  I would rather have the pants and go elsewhere   Make sure you have receipts for your clothes You will need.
Well I am not a fan of sprint to start of just customer service is not a big part of there picture  :(.
I had a root canal done on June 14th and 3 weeks later went back for my permanent where i complained of pain to eating cold and hot His assistant took x rays and told me it was cement in my teeth when he was removing and cleaning up my temporary crown Dr Moeller came in didnt say a word about my x ray and put my crown on then i go again August 8th to have them find out why im in more pain and called ahead and said i dont want to be billed and im not paying anymore money until u tell me whats wrong so i go and they bill my insurance and he tells me some patients dont take to a root canal and might need surgery So far from the truth so September 4th comes and im in excruciating pain constantly now I go to an endodontist of my choice and find out that my root canal was not done properly it needed to be redone and because my insurance is now tapped out due to Dr Moeller i now have paid $100000 out of my pocket and find out he billed me for a filling i already had So now my insurance has paid $140000 and ive paid $37500 to him and now $100000 out of pocket for retreatment I went to get my crown filled and find out its also not done properly so now I need to pay $140000 out of pocket for that Im at $280000 out of pocket and my insurance is at $140000 This place is a joke and so is he Very unprofessional when it comes to taking responsibility for mistakes I couldnt eat for days or sleep i was on pain pill and anitibiotics and lost wages from having to miss work to run around a deal with this With no help from Comfort Dental Please do not go here His lack of concern has now cost me money and pain and put my family out.
As far as gluten-free eating this airport is TERRIBLE  We were "trapped" in this airport for over 10 hours and searched it from end to end  The best that I could do (to prevent starvation) was to attempt to eat at the Fox Sports Lounge  The waitress had no idea what gluten was and I would most certianly not have eaten there if I didn't feel as though I had no other choice  I ended up with a chicken breast (about 2" by 2" in size) with two onion slices and two pepper slices and 13 pickles on the side (charged full price though)  WOW  I was feeling healthy after that "meal"  Boo to this airport and its eating choices Boo.
Man what a mess I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense This store could use a training day in merchandising The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product Want to throw the staff for a loop ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSEhad to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for Oh forget it Sincerely  Empty Handed.
When I see a China Mist Iced Tea container I usually feel I'm in good hands  I don't know if they just use the container and are using a cheaper brand of tea or it's just not strong enough but the Iced Tea was MEH  I am picky about my tea Pizza is near and dear to my heart and when I found out I had celiac disease and could no longer eat main stream pizza it just about killed me  I have embraced the gluten free lifestyle during the past year and have been on a journey for excellent gf pizza  I found it at Picazzo's and pay a very good price for it  When I saw the $1850 price tag for the "House Special" gf pizza at Mellow Mushroom I thought:  Cool  Pricey but should be an excellent zaHere is the explanation of ingredients:  Red sauce base Mozzarella Pepperoni Sausage Ground Beef Onions Green Peppers Mushrooms Black Olives Tomatoes Ham Bacon and extra cheese  Wow  Sounds great right  Okay first off I am not a ground beef on za kind of girl  So I asked not to have any All the GF pizza is on a 12" crust  Pretty standard  I asked and the server said that corporate makes their flour and sends it to them to make in house  OkayThe crust includes bean rice and tapioca flours as well as many other things  I have had gf pizza's many places and I have to say that this crust was the worst I've ever had  Including those made with mixes from the store  It was nasty  Soggy cardboard about sums it up  I finally gave up and just scraped the toppings off to eat those it was so nastyThe toppings themselves were okay  The meats were forgettable but the veggies were pretty good  I think I've decided I prefer yellow and red peppers over green and I really prefer those and my onions caramelized vs fresh The other thing is that their tomato sauce was extremely bland  Tasted like mediocre tomatoes which were just pureed with no spices whatsoever Come on it's almost a $20 little pie  It needs to taste like itMy husband had the regular House Specialty pizza and he was equally unimpressed I won't be back  I know where I can get my $20 excellent pie and this IS NOT it.
Very Disappointed We were really looking forward to their opening since we live in the neighborhood and it is within walking distance It advertised itself as a wine barnot so much Postinos and Bomberos are wine bars This place is more a beer and burger joint We ordered the garage meat and cheese plate and when it was delivered may husband and I just looked at one another We could not believe for the price we were being served what looked like some refrigerator leftovers I would have been embarrassed to serve this to anyone There was not even enough meat or cheese for one person and it was served with two little pieces of crostini Two glasses of wine and the platter with tax was around $40 We left and went down the street to Postino's for their antipasti boardwow what a difference Their chef needs to visit the competition and learn what is out there To say the least we will not be returning.
Still sickening Really I got sick twice here I tried this place again because other friends of mine say that they really like it  Apparently they are not eating at the one in Maricopa  I should know better when they still do not know what oregano is when I ask for it  I recently also went to a Barro's in Mesa and I had not a problem  It was fabulous  So maybe it is JUST this one I am just unlucky here.
Dry  Bland  Gristly  Bad cuts of meat in sickly sweet sauce  This place only makes me love my favorite BBQ places more (oh Fat Matt's Rib Shack why do you have to be all the way in Atlanta)and no greens on the menu  For shame.
Horrible  It's really a shame this is one of the few breakfast places in Ahwatukee  I've lived in Club West for 14 years and we were all SO excited for this placethat excitement quickly came to an end whenOn multipe occasions my running group on a date or just a casual lunch with my business associates I ended up saying "I'll never come back" The owners and staff treat their customers like they are fortunate to be dining in their facility  My experiences include:Burnt pancakes (really  who does this)Burnt coffee  (too lazy to make a fresh pot)Under cooked eggs when they were ordered over medium (yes your chef should know this)Rude servicePlan on being there for 2 hours to get served and recieve your foodOut of "fish of the day" by 6pm  Really order more next timeAnd to top it off I took my parents here once for dinner and the cook in the back choked up a lugie (yes the kitchen is part of the restaurant and you hear everything)SO grossThis time Hillside Spot - I won't be back.
Not happy What a shady placeI call to make an appointment and get a quote as I haves budge to love by Our dog only needed his yearly shots and a check up What they quoted and what they actually charged was WAY off Then they convince me to have his anal glands extracted and hand me a bottle of allergy spray only to find out I would be charged extra for THAT I refused the spray much to the nurse's disdain and argued that I was not asked permission or told the additional cost of the anal extraction They scammed me and on top of that the doctor talked more about his own dogs than actually talking about mine his own patient Will not be going here again :(.
Closed.
Defiantly no where near an authentic Chicago dog Grilled bun and jumbo dog cut in half Won't be having anotherFries were good Next time I'll try Italian bee and burger and see if those can save the place.
Unsanitary  I wish I would have read the previous reviews (cockroach etc) as that would have saved us from one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long long time  We ordered a chicken panini (in which they got it wrong and used ham) a soup which was so salty that it was inedible and finally a salad which came complete with a long blonde hair of one of the workers (we both have black hair) After showing the hair the only response I got was a refund of just the salad  Please avoid this as there are much better options in Desert Ridge  Even paradise bakery is a much better option.
While I have absolutely no complaints about the food this review is for the service receivedThe first time I received disrespectful service when I went with my best friend I spoke to the manager about it and let it go Now that this has happened again I'm letting fellow Yelpers know I went in with my boyfriend on a Monday around 2pm it was not busy yet there was no one there to greet us nor sit us down at a table After standing there and seeing the other servers look at us my boyfriend had to walk up to the bar and ask for help It was only then that a guy came out from behind the bar to sit us down at a table As he returned to the bar it took another few minutes before a girl came around to bring us two glasses of water and walk away That was it no greeting whatsoever When we finally were able to order our food the girl asked my boyfriend what kind of bread he wanted As it was his first time there he didn't know what the options were and what the difference was between the breads Instead of explaining it to him when he asked the girl simply stared at him like he was stupid and asked again if he wanted chiabata or focaccia So I had to explain it to him instead TALK ABOUT BEING RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL The rest of the time we were there the only time we had any "help" from the servers was when they brought our food or refilled our water glasses Not once did anyone say anything to us or ask if we needed anything I wanted to ordered a drink but decided not to if they didn't even care to askNote: I've never had an issue with the male staff/servers but the females are (excuse my language) b****es They seriously need to hire female servers who are friendly and provide good customer service to EVERYONE.
Am glad my hubby liked his sushi as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever hereOur waitress was not exactly a firecracker spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers and didn't seem in any hurry to help usI am not a fish fan but dearly love shellfish so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me I was expecting to be doing the same Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle Thought maybe this was a fluke so went for #2 Not only was it even colder but it had a funny taste and a fairly dry rubbery textureWhen the waitress returned I asked if the shrimp was meant to be cold She said no and asked if I wanted her to get me another dish I asked if the shrimp would be hot this time She said yes and took my dish A few minutes later she returned with my original dish risotto re-piled in the middle with fresh greens and the remaining 5 shrimp from my first order Shrimp were now warm but VERY dry rubbery and had a funny taste to them When she returned again I told her that the shrimp tasted funny and hubby showed her how dry they were He asked if the shrimp had been frozen and she said yes She returned a few minutes later to tell me that I was eating my meal incorrectly Apparently after 50 years I am unable to dine in a restaurant without instruction I was told that the shrimp were intentionally bland because I was supposed to cut them up and stir them in with the flavorful risotto and sprouts I advised her that the shrimp wasn't bland it tasted funny rubbery and dry No response No offer to get a different meal for me Nothing No adjustment was made to our check and my strongly worded letter to Kabuki will be for a full refund no gift card as I wouldn't be caught DEAD there again.
Pretty all-around terrible experience at RnR last week between the food the drinks the service and the cleanliness  I had heard about the place for a while so I suggested it to my group of 4  We decided to pay a visit during the early evening  It's a very nice space with Scottsdale-attractive staffand that's about where the positive part of this review ends Upon arrival we ordered four cocktails from their "signature" cocktail list then watched as muscles the bartender read a cheat sheet on exactly how to make them While the bartender was clearly struggling with the "signature" cocktails we ordered several shared appetizers--which came out long before the cocktails ever arrived  The food was cold and some items were not cooked all the way through--maybe a product of them being rushed to our table for some reason  "Baked" brie was cold and unmelted and the much-hyped animal fries looking like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours (but still cold)the only decent thing was the shrimp tacos but it's pretty hard to screw up a fried shrimp taco Then the cocktails arrived and perhaps predictably they all came out looking and tasting awful just the wrong balance of flavors and not mixed correctly  The ice had melted because of the time spent trying to mix them  And two of them kinda tasted like rubbing alcohol Or gasoline  Our server had disappeared from the beginning leaving us with runners who would only say "I'll get your server" whenever we had even the simplest of requests--like: "can we get some side plates" "I'll get your server"  Finally fifteen minutes after the food arrived the server came by and provided us with side plates for the shared appetizers  Not that we needed them at that point but the side plates were still very wet from being washed and several had food residue on them Disgusting After the four terrible $13 cocktails cold appetizers poor service and dirty plates we decided to pack in our planned dinner and head down the street to a place that knew how to mix a drink and cook  Of course it took forever to get our check because the server pulled another disappearing act for about 20 minutes and when the check came we were shocked at how much all this awfulness cost: almost $90 to be fed cold food and bad drinks while being ignored  Sorry RnR but we're never coming back and we've told many people to do the same.
This review is for the SanTan Honda Service Dept:I would not recommend them  They failed to fix my '08 Civic  Turns out there was carbon build up in one of the cylinder heads on the engine  A dealer out of state fixed it because San Tan lacked any expertise in problem solving  They just depended on my car's "computer" to tell them there was something wrong  Too bad the car's computer wasn't that smart Glad someone else fixed it by working hard with the Honda Tech line.
Service and food suck balls.
I didn't even want to give one star I don't know what happened to Nypd I placed my order and they had to call me back to tell me they don't make a certain item anymore I read it right off there website they need to update their menu Nypd use to be my favorite place to get pizza not anymore To make matters worse they charged me extra for getting a similar dish and didn't tell me intern the delivery boy didn't get a big enough tip since I was paying with all the cash I had on me I felt so bad Nypd need to clean up their act.
I told my wife not to make me come here and she didn't listen  I waited forever for take out  They screwed up the order beyond belief  The staff doesn't know the ingredients in their own products  I waited 30+ minutes for them to fix an order that very explicitly said "no cheese"  I brought home the wrong sandwich to my wife because they screwed up  One tiny container of sauce for a bucket of pasta  Disaster  Wife called back and the manager offered to remove just the sandwich  When she asked if that was really all they were going to do the manager said "I don't know what else you want me to do" Hmmmm  How about manage the restaurant teach employees the ingredients in your food and provide a certain level of customer service when you colossally screw up  I'm glad she finally realizes how much this place sucks because I've known it for years  Never again  One star is generous.
Let's start with the positive: The food and drinks tasted greatWORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME We ordered three margaritas and two orders of tacos and the bartender charged us for six margaritas and four orders of tacos--plus he charged us for the beer of the guy next to us When I tried to get him to fix it he came back with the wrong amount a second time (still over charging us) and the the third time he just ran my credit card without allowing me to see the itemized bill I was mortified and he extremely rudeAlso the people next to me gave their credit card and when they attempted to get it back they were told by this same bartender that they never gave him their card They insisted for thirty minutes and which point he said to them" NO ONE HERE HAS YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU GAVE IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND YOU DIDN'T" When another bartender gave them back the card a few minutes later there was no apologyZ Tejas is right across the street The food is delicious and the bartenders are phenomenal I was just there and without my even saying anything when the food took over twenty minutes to come out they comped our entire meal.
I'll start with the good: the happy hour drinks and the patio are pretty freaking awesome The bad: Ordered the turkey burger because the waitress highly recommended it I love turkey burgers so I was SUPER excited She promised that it was like omg SO good It wasn't It was horrible  I am convinced that they were trying to get rid of soon to be expiring turkey or that she gets some kind of turkey burger bonus The ugly: we ordered nachos for the table  They brought the nachos out and we started eating They came back a few minutes later and said that our plate was actually a special order for another table  THEY TOOK OUR PARTIALLY EATEN PLATE OF NACOS AND GAVE THEM TO THE RIGHT TABLE  I wish I was kidding but thIs actually happened You could tell that our plate had been picked at as well  That has to be the craziest thing that's ever happened to me at a restaurant  None of us could believe that happened  So gross.
Poor service from the cashier and the manager They ran out of ice I already paid for my meal and wanted to get ice with my drink The manager said they would not fill up the ice because they were too busy She refused to refund my money I had to get back to work and did not want to fight about a cup of ice The Burgers are over priced They have the worst fries I've tastedI called back to try to speak to a manager They said they could not help me.
This was my first visit to this medical office  I made an appointment for vaccinesI was told to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork As I walked into the office the waiting room is very drab and dirty They had many papers taped on the doors and walls regarding cell phone use and other notices I signed in at the front desk The girl at the desk was not welcoming and never smiled I arrived 25 minutes early and had printed the forms off of their website and completed prior to the visit I was still given additional forms to fill out the front desk receptionist told me not all the forms are available on the website I politely mentioned someone should update the website I proceeded to fill out the forms The forms I completed from the website were the typical personal and medical history However the additional forms I was asked to complete were a bit strange The first was a form on varicose and spider veins (family history and symptoms I may be experiencing) the second was a prescription policy stating they will not call in or fax prescription requests to the pharmacy you must pick up the written request Lastly was a doctor-patient arbitration agreement I have NEVER had to fill out a form like this at any doctors office I have visited At this point I was questioning this medical practice and their doctors I found this to be unsettlingAfter waiting for 50 minutes in the waiting room I watched 3 people go into the back office before me and they arrived after me I was finally called back I walked through the door to the back office I was directed to a small corner to have my vitals checked This was not a closed space or room I was out in the open other patients and staff were walking past me After that I was escorted to a private room I will say that the  medical assistant was very friendly Then the doctor came into the room she never introduced herself Luckily I knew who I was seeing (Dr Finley) and she was very nice and answered all of my questions pertaining to the vaccinesI will not go back to this office and will not recommend it to my friends and family.
This place is a dive  My husband and I tried it for the first time this morning and the food was TERRIBLE  The only thing we received that was hot was the coffee  I ordered a glass of water coffee and eggs Benedict  First the water tasted like it came directly from the tap not at all filtered the Benedict  was mildly warm along with cold "hash browns" (these are really chopped potatoes with no seasoning)  My husband ordered iced tea corned beef hash with hash browns sourdough bread and a pancake on the side  His tea tasted like lipton nothing special and all of his food was barely warm  The toast was so cold the butter didn't even melt I could not believe that the waitresses that walked by did not say something  The pancake tasted like it came out of a box and the corned beef hash was straight from a can  I do not understand how this place is still in business  The prices are way to high for the poor quality of food that is served we paid over $30 and I left feeling like I had food poisoning  We will never return  If anyone is looking for a good HOT breakfast check out Biscuits on Elliott and 48th St on the West end of the Safeway parking lot or The Nosh on Warner and 48th St.
Ate there last night Had a big hair in my food Kinda grossed me out so I only ate half What I tasted was good.
As much as I am a lover of all W's due to the trendy scene the touch of details and the unique style to a hotel stay I have to say that the W Scottsdale does provide all of this BUT the rudeness of the staff takes away from all the positives I stayed there in May this past year and had a bad experience with staff- I recall saying to myself "Well never going back there again" Well like any loyal person I gave it a go again when they were having their Phoenix Suns GalaI encountered the same rude staff and they even seemed to get more rude I will always be a fan of W's but I will never return to this one.
I brought in my Volvo for simple routine maintenance they forgot to rest the warning indicator so I brought it back and it took them a half hour to reset and they charged over $200 A week later my battery failed and it was all corroded and obviously never inspected I am going back to the dealer where they charge less and I don't have any further issues Stay away.
Will never go here again Food was cold and overpriced for what we got They were out of a lot of their sides and when I asked KFC to contact me via their website they never did I'm not a person that sends back food and when I have bad service I try to assume they are busy or it's just an off day But in this case avoid at all costs.
Awful - I can not say do not go enough how bad this place is - I am a bleeding heart and have given it 5 chances   I can only hope that is closes and is replaced but a restaurant that knows what it is doing - anything at this point would be better  Please put this - poor service unacceptable- whatever it is out of business  The food looks as if it has sat for days in the sun the service is beyond awful and the people just do not seem to care  I almost want to stop people from walking in I feel so bad when I see them heading there  I live within walking distance and would love a cute wine bar cafe or a mini AJ's there - PLEASE- end this awful place.
HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE  I decided to save a few dollars and go to this Great Clips location for a quick shampoo and trim  As I walked in there was an elderly man in front of me  He was asking how long the wait was and if it was possible to put his name down The Assistant Manager Immanuel was extremely rude to him and told him they don't take appointments and to go on-line to reserve a time Then the manager rudely asked him "do you want an appointment or not" and the poor man looked frustrated and said no and walked out  I was next in line and gave him my phone #  I was only interested in a shampoo and trim so when my turn came I asked the sylist if he could blowdry my hair and the Assistant Manger yelled out from his station "it's 50 dollars for a blow dry" I told my stylist that it was too much and to forget it He ended up telling me during my haircut that he would do a quick power dry and would not charge me so I thought that was nice and  figured I would give him an extra tip  After the blowdry we walked over to the register and he told me it would be $48 dollars  As he noticed that amount was incorrect the Assistant Manager Immanuel stepped away from his customer and angrily walked over  He was very confrontational telling me to look at the wall to see the prices  His attitude totally shocked me and I told him that he was being very rude  After he walked away my stylist was trying to find a solution but Immanuel came back and was practically in my face yelling about the prices I actually had to tell him to BACK OFF twice and then he told me " I AM THE ASSISTANT MANAGER" which was absolutely ridiculous  People like Immanuel do not belong in management or customer service  I did call their corporate headquarters and the owner of this location called me back right away and was very apologetic and refunded me the blow dryImmanuel is surely scaring customers away and  I wouldn't trust him to run my business.
Buyer beware that the prices they show on line are not the same prices you find when you call  i was sold a org domain even when I told them that I was a for profit business  They didn't tell me org were reserved for non-profits  When I tried to get my money back they said I could use the org even though my web developer said I shouldn't  i wanted to buy another domain but when I told them the price online they said they were having problems with their website  I went ahead and purchased while I was on hold and hung up  It seems like their employees are pressured into hard sales because the first time I tried to by a domain name for $799 the guy I spoke to tried to pressure me into buying things I didn't need  When I refused he transferred me to another rep by saying he didn't handle this type of call The second person I spoke to was very pleasant.
We are used to snappy service and a clean restaurant at VI This VI had neither  4:30  on a Sunday afternoon shouldn't be too busy and in fact there were maybe 3 parties in the whole restaurant but getting waited on was a challenge  Forget refills on drinks  And I actually had to walk into the kitchen to tell the staff that we were ready to order pie ( which I'd already alerted our waiter that we wanted)  Finally got waited on by another server who was taking over for our waiter who was on break   We got our desserts and our bill which included about 3 items we hadn't ordered  We brought that to the attention of our waiter who was back from break and acted like he had caught it and had corrected it NOT  We had to wait  for a new bill   That's just my commentary on the service  I won't bore you with the cleanliness issues  The staff and apparently the management aren't interested in making money  We won't be back.
Sicilian-Style Pizza was a complete joke  Adding $5 to the price of a regular crust pizza for the worst cardboard bread ever  Too bad it was a take-out order and I live more than 10 miles away from this joint  It would have been sent back if the first bite of cardboard occurred in-houseWings = decent  Basically a 15 if there were half stars.
Well folksit is a sad sad day up in North ScottsdaleBlue Wasabi in DC Ranch has served its last piece of sushi  They were closed as of Saturday  FYI: it is rumored that Kevin the owner did not want to renew his lease  Also closing will be San Felipe across the street.
I went to eat here today because I was in the mood for something different and did not want to go far I should have stuck with Cheba Hut I ordered a burger and fries The burger meat was probably OK but whatever cheese they use on their burgers was disgusting It tasted like the $099 cheese that you but when you are a few days away from payday and need something to go on your bologna sandwiches I would highly recommend that you avoid this place I have never been somewhere that screws up a simple burger this bad Never eating here again.
We went there on a Monday afternoon  It was slightly crowded  We sat in the bar area  It took a while to be noticed  We placed our order which came in good time  The meal was terrible  I ordered pollo fundido and did not like it at all  The only thing I could taste was sour cream  I would not go back I would sooner drive to Phoenix and get better food.
Phoenix Sky Harbor I've seen your plans for light rail connecting the terminals and the rental car center and they look glorious 2015 can't come soon enough though --- the rental car center transportation (and the rental car center itself) as it is now is the worst I've seenWhy is it the worst you ask- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that- the garages are massive and not well signed You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking did I miss it Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next directionAll I can say fellow Yelpers is that I wish you luck and recommend you build an extra 30-45 minutes if airport time into your trip if you're renting a carThe airport itself is fine Not a huge airport the food options are regular old airport food options The baggage claim/ticketing/security areas are all fine Nothing special or awesome but no real complaints The nice thing about flying through PHX is that there are rarely flights delays due to weather.
My Compass Visa acct is such a nightmare to me  I'm supposed to get 544% APR  balance transfer FOR LIFE when I first open my acct but when I received my 1st statement I was charged 1344% APR (regular) balance transfer  Also instead of FOR LIFE now it says the duration is only for 99 months I called and the phone rep admitted the error but it would require TWO(2) MONTHS to rectify the error Then I made my payment 2 days after I received the statement but  online still shows that I need to make a min payment of  $XXXX by 5/11/2013 even though they acknowledged receipt of the payment I made  IWO the company never bothered to update the online info  So now I don't know if I should make another payment  This bank must have hired  the absolute lowest efficient workersit is amazing.
Err:501
Obese guy wearing a king's crown at the counter  What the heck  Drive thu was the slowest I've seen in my entire life and I was given a disingenuous apology from the staff who noted that an employee "just walked out"  No attempt to make it right no free food no discounted order nothing  This is place is hard to beat  Interior is very dirty too.
We planned ahead to have dinner here and made reservations the for 6:15 PM before going to the 7:30 PM showing of Dreamgirls at the MAC Arrived around 6:20 and was seated immediately The place was crowded and the service seemed to be a bit slow We all ready knew what we wanted so we ordered our meal at 6:30 PM My wife and I sat and conversed over hot Jasmine tea Some time had past and the server came to our table and told us that it would be another 10 minutes before our order would be ready and do we want to wait I looked at the time and it was 7:10 I told him 'NO void our ticket So we got up and left for the theatre If they were on Top Chef I would have told them to 'pack your knives and LEAVE'The food is excellent there but if you can't produce in a timely manner then WHY even openI think their problem is that they possible have one chef and when the restaurant is crowded there is NO WAY they can keep the patrons HAPPYThere was a another table with two ladies and they were able to eat just the appetizerI hope the owners of the restaurant are reading these comments from YELP because they have to open their eyes to see they are above the heads and NEED to hire another CHEF in the kitchenIf there was an option of ZERO stars that's what I would have rated them.
Loves I'm the sushi chef at home and I make fresher and tastier sushi than a restaurant up the road from me The sushi rice was tough and hard not steamy and fresh out of the rice cooker like it was just sitting there for hours y'know The fish did not taste fresh to me and I always make my sushi fresh at home My step-father even looked up at me as we where eating and said "I'm spoiled at home really I am" I laughed but silently agreed with him The Price: Ridiculous Period Who wants to pay $65 for sushi that tastes bad when I could have made the same amount for around $10 and it taste terrific Never again The only thing I like about the place is the amazing waiter she's friendly and does so much work that I really appreciate her  You go girl.
Went in for lunch today and walked out after waiting 20 mins for a server to come to our table  No one came by no water no one to take our order nothing  Servers were either all yacking behind the counter or all 3 of them waiting on 1 table Everyone should skip this place and go to New Mexican Grill instead.
Overpriced  Does not remember customer loyalty.
Don't eat here unless you want hair in your food This is was a complete let down  I had to remind my waitress to get my coffee she didn't get our order right and the was hair in the hash browns GROSS.
Not that great but it is between this place Wendy's and Starbucks in terminal 3 So if you want booze this is your only option Chips were stale and salsa had zero flavor and resembled ketchup Again this is the only show in town (aka terminal 3).
It may be cool and trendy but the service is not all that great the lobby is kind of dirty and the glass that separates to the bar/restaurant to lobby is kind of dirty the only thing it's really spectaculars  is the pool and then the view from the top of the roof that would be about it.
lied about wait time  billing department is nightmare  calling to collect when it was already paid don't go there.
I am writing this review after submitting 2 emails to the European Wax center with no response  I sent one on Sept 29 directly to GuestServices@waxcentercom and another to the "contact us" section on their website on Oct 13  I still have received no response  I am giving 1 Star only because of the lack of customer service  So now I am posting my exact letters that I sent to their customer service departments because I am extremely upset with their customer service"I wanted to let you know of a bad experience I had yesterday Friday September 28th at the Camelback location in Arizona  I had an appointment at 1145 for Brazilian Bikini Wax   I had purchased the pack of 12 waxes from another location but have used the majority of them at the Camelback location since I work close to there  For the past year I have mostly gone to the same wax person I cant remember her name I think Lisa but she was from NJ and just recently left the location because she moved  She was wonderful  After each wax she made sure she wiped the whole area down tweezed any missed hairs and applied the ingrown hair solution before I left  She also gave me a mirror to check and make sure that I was ok with itYesterday I was given a new wax person (new to me)   I am not sure of  her name either - but I am sure you can look up my appointment in the computer  She had brown hair and a full arm of tattoos   While she was very nice and did make me feel comfortable the wax was not a good wax at all  I told her that the wax was extremely hot and she said I was actually the 2nd person of the say to mention that and she thought it was weird because the wax was cooler than normal  She completed the wax and just put on baby powder and sent me on my way  When I got home I noticed that my underwear was stuck to me - because there was still wax left  And not just a few spot - a decent amount  As I was washing it off - I noticed that there were still hairs all over  She hadn't plucked any of the hairs that didn't come out with the waxing  And I was already getting little red bumps as she did not apply the serum and left wax on  I immediately applied the serum that I purchase from your company and have applied 3 times since yesterdayOne issue was at check out  I asked for a full bikini instead of a Brazilian yesterday  Normally when I go to the other locations they credit my account the $7 since I paid for the package of Brazilian and only used a bikini  Then I am able to use that $7 for other waxing services  I was told yesterday that this location cannot do that  I don't understand how certain locations can and certain locations cannot  I then asked if they can apply the $7 that I did not use right then to a lip wax and I would pay the rest - they said noToday I have at least 10 big red bumps and no smooth "just waxed" feeling at all  It feels as if I was there almost a week ago  I am extremely unhappy with the service that this employee gave me and felt that you should know  I have 2 Brazillian waxes left on my package and they asked me if I wanted to renew and buy another 12  I did not do so and seriously have to consider whether or not I am going to"Especially after no response to either letter that I sent in I am extremely disappointed in this company  I would most certainly not recommend going to the Camelback location as I feel the staff has declined there.
I purchased a gift certificate from LocalDines for this place as it is close to home so I thought we'd give it a try  Upon arriving we presented it to our waitress who informed us that the manager no longer accepts them even though I only bought it a week ago  Now I have to try to get a refund on the certificate since they won't honor the deal that they made  We were also informed that they no longer do 1/2 off bottle of wine night on Friday's (even though their website STILL says they do)  They did give us a discount for the trouble but that doesn't make up for their bait and switch on the gift certificate (which was $10 for a $30 gift cert) and the false advertising on their own website  The waitress was very nice about it so we decided to stay since we were already thereThe food was typical to above average for a bar drink prices were nothing special even at happy hour  I had the Chicken Cesar Focaccia which was a little dry and not really as tasty as what I'm accustomed to at Zipps  My wife liked her salad and soup generous for a 1/2 salad  They did not make a good first impression so I don't anticipate going back  If they're not willing to do what's right based on their promotions and own advertising then I'm not going waste my time with them in the future  Just not good business.
this bank is terrible and will charge you unfounded fees it is a hassle to try and communicate with this bank and their customer service is terrible i would not recommend this bank unless it is for someone you don't like and would like them to become financial screwed.
Wow  $60 for 2 coffees  Thats right folks my account was charged 10 times for a 10 transaction I watched the girl chatting away as she swiped my debit card back and forth proclaiming " It was denied again Sorry "  Well I checked my online account while she stood there and then showed her " Visually" that my account had been charged 10 times But it was declined  she said Right around then I started to loose it said some choice things I will not repeat here and stormed off as I was late getting my daughter to school  I will not be back to Dutch Bros Time to go back to a place where people are trained and dont use the Foursquare system which she blamed everything on.
I dropped my jacket to get it dry-clean they returned it back exactly the same with the spilled juices on it and they still charged me $6 I'd never go back again and their manager is very disrespectful when she talked to me on the phone.
Seems like every time i come here lately a side order of bad attitude that i didn't order is served up  Won't be coming back after the particularly snotty attitude I got from a Ms Elizabeth tonight though What a shame the sweet potato fries were actually decent here.
Hmmm the sign outside Cyprus in Chandler says they open at 11 so why did they open at noon today  Screwed up my date and so we ran over to Grimaldi's instead.
We tried CHoP last weekend We went in with the intention to sit at the bar order a couple glasses of wine (or more) have an app salad and an entree (woo date night)When we walked in we were immediately impressed with the decor/ambiance It was  a nice (upscale) change from the typical places in the Chandler area We found a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine while we perused the menu Try to stay 'healthy' we decided on chicken satay a salad and the pork chops The wine was delicious and the wine menu was impressiveThen the chicken satay came outI took the first bite and tried to figure out if I really liked the over-seasoned taste or if it was 'too much' - at the same time I realized that something was just 'off'My husband took a bite and said "uh this is undercooked" He cut the chicken down the middle to separate it from the skewer The chicken was RAW not just pink RAW If you have been to CHoP then you know it is really dark in there The chicken was SO raw that you could even see it in the darkI immediately spit out my second bite that i had taken in the meantime The bar waitress notices asks us if there is an issue to which we reply "ya this is raw" She looked concerned but not mortified like we were that we just ate raw chicken She asked if we wanted to order a different appetizer Confused as to what just happened we both said "sure" But as we looked at the menu (remembering that we ordered pork for the  entreeand raw pork is pretty bad too) we decided to cancel our order and go to Sauce In the mean time when our bartender heard what happened she came over and said "well the good news is that as long as it reached a certain temperature it shouldn't do any harm" (ummmmhuh) My husband replied "if it was raw then it didn't reach a certain temperature trust me" So - they comp'd our drinks (which was nice) But I was a little put off that the manager/owner didn't want to talk to us Maybe we left too soon.
I usually go elsewhere when I do laundry but as of late it seems any laundromat I go to seems to be on the fritz of despair I recently went to this location they had 27 I repeat 27 machines that did not work it was a mess and the coin machine I repeat the coin machine was out of servicehow the fuck am I suppose to do laundry without quarters Luckily I brought some with me and also had some on reserve in my car ashtray but I am short just a few bucks for drying So the girl behind the counter notifies me that she has change which I promptly hand her a 20 and say can I get like two dollars worth of change she says she can not change out a 20 dollar bill I have had the worse luck at laundromats lately I swear between the dimwitted help and broken machines the only reason this place did not get a flaming bag of dog poo thrown against it's window is because it has a few classic arcade games insidethat probably are out of order too.
Subways are supposed to be very uniform but this was not The meat was mediocre nothing tasted fresh at all And to top everything off the employee insulted me and my clothes and was hitting on my sister It was a very unpleasant experience.
I know I know you all loved it right  I went it was like a tourist nightmare  The food was very average  The usual re fried beans and rice crap that Mexicans think White people love but in fact many of us think it is boring and tasteless and uncreative  The Margarita was so-so  They want it to look authentic but it is like Macayo's with a cooler looking establishment  Won't be back  Boring foodTourist attraction to bring people from Idaho to see  Good chips and salsa though I give them thatIt is not authentic it just looks authentic to fool touristsOh yeah the Fundido was a cardiologists dream come true  A truly horrific glob of greasy cheese mutation of food  Honestly this place is abysmal.
Been here a few times and this time was the worse  May be they were too caught up this time with the Ferrari Club who had stopped byCold food very small portions for entrees guests were shocked at just how small looked like an appetizer  Food is also just not very good this is KFC quality at very high pricesService was slow and impersonal and the restaurant was quiet- two meals arrived over twenty minutes late not the "it will be ready in two minutes" promised by the waiter and came with no apology nor any impact to the bill  I brought it to the manager's attention no apology and off she went to do something more important  Really bad experience  This was a table of +12 that they could have cared less about  Wow to be that cavalierCannot imagine returning anytime soon  I work once a month close by and will not be taking any clients here until there are drastic changes  Too many other restaurants within walking distance.
You feel like you're in a used car lot  The staff is WAY too aggressive with sales my last Dental office treated patients more like a real Doctor  not just a customer to see how much money they can get out of every visit.
I had Vday dinner here last night and was not happy at all  The food was cold and under expectation  The service was disappointing the food was cold and the wine selections were poor  20% tip was included which is ok except the service was terrible  However why should the service be exceptional when it is an automatic add on  Since there was an automatic tip add on the staff should step it up and justify that their tip was well derserved  Between my bf and I we each try an option on their pre-fixed menu  Our first course was salad and soup which was ok  Secound course was fancy rice w brocolli (which is rice) and my bf had pork-belly (which is two slices of lard) eat it if you want to clog up your artery (both dishes were served cold and we waited at least 30 minutes per plate)  Third was pan seared scallops which smelled fishy and served cold after 40 minute wait time  Then there was new york steak which is not served hot not tender and filled with chewy sections  Fourth was the dessert which i have to eat a lot of because I was still hungry forcing myself to eat all the terrible courses listed above  To point out why it was a bad experience the place wanted to charged customers each $60 for a four course and an automatic 20% tip on top of your total bill  The fact that I am complaining about the price is because the food selection was not up to par nothing was fresh or served in its appropriate temperature  We had to wait for our replacement of forks and knieves between courses even after they brought out luke warm  Nothing about our experience was impressive perhap The House at Secret Garden should focus on excellent service best selected produce & poultry before charging so much for mediocre quality in food and terrible service  This experience definitely ruined my V day and will never come back  I literally was robbed feel that the wait for service and food was not worth it  Cafe Monarch Mastro at Ocean Club are better options  True Food would have done better then The House at Secret Garden  In addition wine selection was crap  We paid $210 and know for a fact that we will never ever return  Dislike this place so much I spend my wed morning to inform people who has higher expectation to avaoid such tragic.
Tanya W I wished so bad that I had read your review before I myself became involved with these clowns  They completely ruined what's supposed to be one of the most fondest memories of your life     My experience with them: I found a dress that I liked not loved When I found it I was all alone so I had the opinions of the BC staff coercing me into thinking this is the best dress and the best deal I will ever find I felt very torn about the dress but time is running out before my wedding date and I felt I needed to come to a decision sooner than later So I wrote them a check for 1600 (a steal according to them) and left no sooner than I had started my car to go home I was having second thoughts and by the time my 15 minute car ride was over and I was opening my front door that I thought "Oh my god I don't want that dress" So I called and told them of my second thoughts and told them I was coming back 15 minutes later I was back in their store arguing with John the President of the store He told me that I was just having bridal nervousness and that this was normal He also said that I probably left his store to go to another store and found another dress there and that he didn't believe me He also said he had already gone to the bank in the last 15 minutes so there is nothing he could do After this drawn out argument I told him that after he was so unwilling to help his customer having been called a liar and that I "liked the dress you're just nervous" I told him that he was making me incredibly uncomfortable and that I didn't want to do business with people who operated like this I told him I was going to cancel my check and that there was nothing I could do about that *zing Long story short Jerry called me that night and told me that i was under contract with them and that I had to get a dress with them whether it was that one or another one I said when I come back I don't ever want to see John again and that she really needs to re-evaluate the way they treat their customers Needless to say when I went to pick up my dress yesterdayeverything was in boxes and disarray  I found out they are "moving" (read as going out of business i bet considering they have no place to move to yet) That's what happens when you run a petty money pinching unprofessional business that they did and I don't feel bad at all I got my dress and I am washing my hands of these fools forever.
I took my daughter here on 4-20-2013 and they were able to get me in a last min apt Well i wish they didn't I hardly get my nails done and when I do i want to get pampered The women doing my daughters nails had no clue what to do with her even though they clearly stated child mani padie they rushed us in and out of the chair with my spa mani and pedi taking 23 min for both at a not worth it value of $55 for both of us The women who had me clearly had callouses on her hands that were rough on my feet along with her answering her phone to her husband during my hand rub that lasted 30 sec each hand I will never waste my hard earned money here again.
I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day  I didn't want to write this because everyone is entitled to their own opinion of services and food and didn't want to damage another business reputation with just my opinion So here it goesMy son and I go here to eat all the time because it's convenient instead of having to drive all the way out to Phoenix or Mesa for really good Pho  It's good not great by any means but could be great if you just don't know anything about Pho  However the service here is the worst I've ever experienced  I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude  Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude hereI've just always put up with it because it's just typical of Pho restaurants  So headed back to work my friend asked me to pick up an order to go for her  After waiting for about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the to go order even though we placed the order when we ordered our other food too the order came back wrong  I told the pregnant owner what our correct order was  She placed the order by the registered and left us there hanging  After another 20 minutes I asked for the order again  She said they are too busy and have decided not to correct the order  I asked her why she didn't tell me and would just make me sit there and wait  No answer other than that she is too busy to deal with it  So I pay and put under the tip line none because poor service  Actually wrote that in so that they won't write in their tips which they have done once before on me I reconciled my statement over the weekend and pull out my receipt  Apparently I have now also been charged the to go order even though I didn't take it  Called and she answered and argues with me that I took the order  This is ridiculous  We are not some scam artist or willing to lie over some $9 order  Tried to explain to her that we did not but she just hung up the phone on me  Wow  Talk about hormonal.
This used to be the amazing Angel Sweet which I absolutely loved I have only been back one time since Gelato Spot took over and boy was that a mistake Like all the other reviewersI don't know if you can even call this Gelato anymore which is weird as I have been to their Scottsdale location and while not the best gelato it is worlds apart from what they sell at the Chandler spot The "gelato" was expensive the scoop size was small and the flavours were definitely lackingThey had a peanut butter and rasberry flavour that I sampled that I almost spit out Now for a guy whose nickname is Icecreamismylife there are not many types/flavours of ice cream that I do not like In fact I can only think of one time where I actually did spit out a sample That was when Cold Stone thought it would be a great idea to introduce a Wasabi flavour Well let me say that I actually believe that the Wasabi was better tasting than the pb&rasberry But I guess you can't really take my word for it I had another friend who thought it tasted like a pb&j So you can give it a try Just don't blame me if/when your gag reflex kicks inWith all of the other amazing ice cream parlors in Phoenix I can't see myself returning again to even give it another chance.
I wish their was a no star My wife and I typically carry out from Oregano's down the street(5 stars) but we gave this delivery a shot Complete disappointment and rip off We should have stuck to our typical routine We ordered a medium pizza and wings and the price was ridiculous for the quality and the portions We paid the same amount for the delivery that we would at Oreganos and that includes beers The cheese was rubbery and to be honest it taste the same as any other pizza place throughout the valley Do yourself a favor and consider something else I'm assuming that it's called Streets of NY because it's prices are up to par with NYC's cost of living Complete let down They must still owe Gonzo for the awful radio commercial I heard the other day I apologize for the rant but if it's one thing I can't stand it's flushing money down the toilet Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
I never leave reviews but after going to Clever Koi this weekend I just had too I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good The vibe there is really cool The FOOD on the other hand Was terrible I wanted to like this place so badly Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish itand considering that the portion was very small that says a lot I left hungry I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointedshe said "oh I'm sorry That's too bad" And that was it I've been working in service for over 15 years I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion If you want good drinks and ambiancego If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it.
First the couple good parts: the docs have always been nice and fairly competent unfortunately i've had a different one every single time i've been there so I don't have any loyalty to them the technicians have been fine as wellBut the rest of the staffyikes They are incompetent and downright rude (they were talking crap about me other customers other employees in earshot of everyone) I tried explaining that the doctor told me I could go home call them and tell them the brand features etc I was already wearing and then they would finalize my prescription The "lady" I was passed off to then 1) pressured me to buy contacts from them rather than online and 2) when I refused proceeded to make it as difficult as possible for me to get contacts from anywhere else Despite what the doc said she said that I had to come back for a trial pair because they didn't have any in stock (great) then I'd have to come back a third time for a follow up Ridiculous They didn't get the trials in for over a week I finally made it back in two weeks after that After more arguing I convinced them to let me have a follow up right there and then because I was already wearing the contacts I wanted and this time I brought the actual box and contact case with all the information so I didn't need the trial pair Doc approved I grabbed my contacts lens Rx and bouncedI also needed new glasses but I wasn't giving Nationwide any more business so I went to a Lenscrafters At Lenscrafters they needed my eyeglass Rx (Nationwide had only given me a copy of the contact Rx) so they called Nationwide Nationwide refused to turn over the prescription unless I faxed a release which of course took them a half hour The lady at Lenscrafters was stunned She had never had to do that and didn't even have a release form because most places will just fax the prescription over no problem By the way you're not a nationwide chain so your name is stupid Never again never again.
Simply AWFUL  It smells like a gym & the Beef & Broccoli was disgraceful  Also If you enjoy Lo Mein without a hint of flavor then this is the place for you  I want my money back.
I assume this place is owned by the same people who own the 16th street location but if it is OMG what are you doing polluting your brand  Stopped there the other night before a flight and was excited because I like the orginal  No ambience and I had this waitress who looked and acted miserable  She also made me feel rushed  So she pushes the special tequila margarita and i get one  Just okay  Then I ask if you can mix and match tacos don't want four of the same taco  No  Then I order a  chile plate and it was so cold and gross it was inedible  I sent it back and asked for guamamole and chips which was actually quite good  Although when the waitress was preparing it tableside she seemed bored and irritated   To her credit she didn't charge me for the chile  Real disappointment go next door to the Grande Orange cafe.
This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out BIG mistake I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had The noodles weren't freshinfact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long Extremely mushy and not edible The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.
Tiramisu is way too sweet (and why sugary nondairy paste instead of mascarpone) and the espresso can best be described as mud.
OMG The ambiance is Walmart or casino food court  They have a sign posted with the house rules such that list do not let children run and roam  It's worse than a public park playground  Children roaming and running unsupervised playing in the food and eating from the buffet food tables  I attended on a Saturday night the crowd it attracted was surprisingly one that doesn't know how to act in public  Food scraps all around the floor  Three children raising havoc in the restroom I watched three female young adults sitting together have a altercation and one had to beat on another  This is the crowd this location attracts  The restaurant staff did nothing to intervene in any situation which they list as inappropriate behavior  This location is going to need bouncers to supervise the dining room as well as the parking lot  Not a civil dining experience it doesn't matter what the food quality is.
Pride is just a time to get drunk and hang out with friends It would be a waist of time and money if you went alone I own a gblt pet business so it may be good for advertising one year I mean pride is for glbt people so its nice to have a place to all hang out for a weekend It's nothing big The parade is a different story I would definitely recommend that.
Want to pretend to be healthyNow you can And ChopShop can helpHere's how:1) Order a kale caesar2) Throw in some delicious protein-packed shrimp Really the shrimp are excellent Skip the tofu3) Enjoy the full cup of caesar dressing that's suffocating the life out of each and every piece of kale and coating your mouth in a film best described as what every salad at the most mediocre chain restaurant in the world tastes like4) Delude yourself into thinking that a bowl of dressing flecked with green is good for youSeriously if you're going to down a thousand calories of salty fat just get a cheeseburger and fries and enjoy the hell out of it Never has ordering a salad made me want to skip dessert until now.
I am not too keen on giving negative reviews but holy God I will never give them my money again Now this is the first time that I have ordered from Vermont but I've had it catered before and so I wanted to get some delivered to my house So I call order three full sandwiches one half and three cookies No special orders or add-ons All as they come The bloke on the phone says that it's going to be 40 minutes I'm at the extreme edge of their service radius and it's about to be lunch time so I figure that's totally acceptable and I go about my business  About 45 minutes go by and I'm feeling the munch so I give them a holler and I realize that he never gave me a total while I wait on hold for five minutes he comes back to the line and tells me that the order left 'seven or eight minutes ago' so it should be in my hungry hands shortly I take it in stride I've been in a good mood all day it's all good Another twenty minutes go by and I've gone from completely calm and not at all affected to full-on angry The driver finally shows- an hour and a half late and I've never been this upset about a sandwich before in my life No apology whatsoever for being egregiously late- something that would result in free food with many other establishments- and then he hands me the check I'm about to sign the slip then I do some quick math and realize that they charged me 7500 For four sandwiches For keeping my cool I deserve a Green Lantern ring but I hand it back to the driver and tell him that I'm not signing it and he tells me that the guy ringing it up screwed up the order Yeah I see that You charged me double That's more than a mistake He leaves promising to have someone call me I take the sandwiches hoping to at least enjoy my food- nope Cold Should have guessed Half an hour later someone finally gets back to me and explains that they overcharged me- still no apology for my food taking twice as long as it was supposed to mind you and he said that he was going to void the original charge (it's still showing in my bank account as a charge) and recharge me but he was going to take the cookies off Because that would make it all better I asked him how much he was charging me for and he responded 'I have no idea' Again I managed to not kick a hole in the nearest child and wear it as a bleeding backpack capable of hatred I don't even think that I let my open-faced contempt seep into my voice when I asked him to find out how much so I didn't wind up with a hundred dollar charge because I wanted a sandwich He finally came back with a total and I ended the call When I first stumbled across their site I didn't get around to ordering because they stop delivering right around the time I get home and they don't have an online option for ordering but my office started getting their food catered in I want to tell them to stop I've not had to deal with that much BS to just get a simple meal over the past two years  Never Never Ever again.
I can summarize this in one word  YUCK  We went for dinner/supper which is part of the problem  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as "well done" anyway  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast go somewhere else.
I was here once a few years ago and was stoked to try a new breakfast place since I was staying downtown all weekend Last time I thought I remember enjoying it but this time not so much First of all I am going to say that I went there Saturday at 9:30AM and again Sunday at 8:15AM Saturday was obviously better for meSaturday we a had pretty cool waiter who was attentive enough but I bet it was because he had other tables nearby so we were easier to wave him over I got the Chickichanga which I loved (got it both mornings) but I was annoyed that the onions I asked them to hold was throughout my meal I could barely taste them and was on a schedule so I didn't complain My colleague asked for no spinach in her egg skillet and it was throughout You cannot miss huge spinach leaves laid through an egg and cheese skillet She didn't say anything and just ate it The coffee was just ok the prices were a little high and the selection was limiting The ice tea was good though and they gave us a to go cup Not bad Got them a 3Then I come to Sunday My wife 4 year old and I went there There was literally ONLY two other tables of customers We were seated by someone who looked like a host or manager but then it was 10 minutes before anyone bothered coming over I finally went found her and asked for coffee I figured she'd come right over She walked in the back talked to someone else and then a few minutes later a lady ran over with a coffee carafe She filled us up and didn't bother asking if my child wanted or needed anything She left I had to go find someone to order a drink after 5 minutes later for my childThe same lady came back and I asked her her name (I don't remember now) and she said America is my server but she was helping her out (why America had ONE other table) We ordered my kid some milk and then our food After 15 minutes I went to find out where the hell my kid's milk was America brought it right over and also an extra water then she disappeared without asking if we needed anything else At this point there was 3 server staff (America the other hispanic lady and a guy) and only TWO tables (the place is not large I could see all of the tables from mine) Fifteen minutes later we got our meals I got the same meal as the day before because I knew what to expect This time no onions which was good We ate paid almost $30 for three of us (my kid ONLY got toast) and got the heck out of there I will not be back.
Zero stars Is that possible I walked in hopeful because I was in a good mood I was welcomed by a "what you want" I said a "basic manicure" she said you pay me first So I paid $ 10 for the manicure and tipped $7 cause I was feeling still optimistic (Ps They charge me 1dollar for using my card) - so already at $18 for a BASIC manicure Then "Kim" sat me in the first chair and started to work on my nails begrudgingly like I was some how bothering her by giving her business She half way filed my nails and left them sand papery and jagged I tried a few times to start a conversation but between her actin pissed off and her son running around and screaming I gave up Then I was feeling a terrible "I should Leave now" feeling But I stayed needless to say my nails are so sloppy my skin is painted my paint never dried even thought I suffered extra long to wait for them to dry I ended up feeling robbed and went home and took of the polish and filed my own nails and re-did them Don't go here You will be sad and probably feel cheated just like me.
Terrible return policy can't find staff for assistance Not what Target used to be like 5 years ago Big let down I'd rather do business elsewhere from now on.
Very poor service came during sports hours Staff refused to change it to a station we of our interest They do have 5 TVs  Was actually told "I am busy"   Beside that the pizza was doughy with a minimal amount of cheese Salad was overpriced and just average and calamari sauce was watery Staff were advised how upset we were after telling them I had a groupon and suddenly tried to be cordial  Left wanting to go to Costco for pizza.
Don't know how this place stays in business  Portions are beyond small One pretzel the size of Starbucks new pretzel is $995 (really)  Steak salad ($1695) is good but not as an entree By the way not considered an entree if you are using a discount voucher  Server argued with me because I presented  the voucher without checking with management  A sure kiss of death for a Scottsdale establishment  Great location I can only hope a more customer service oriented restaurant takes this place over One star for location only.
It's hard to use so many great ingredients and still have the food come out bland but the Donkey pulls it off   Perhaps there is some special process that bleeds the flavor from Hatch Green Chilis that only the Donky know aboutThe tort of  enchiladas was thicker than the quilt grandma made me up In Minnesota  The beans were tasty all 2 ounces of them     The bar waitress was so unattentive I had to call the restaurant on my cell and ask for a watiress to be sent to my table   Gotta love those empty headed Scottsdale bimbosAll in all I would say it is a great restaurnant for Scottsdale gringos who have no idea what real southwestern food tastes like and don't care or about freindly service so long as the building is fancy and they can tell their friends they went to the latest trendy spotThis one will be GONE in a year.
Wife and i were returning from a family photo shoot and decided to stop for a little dinner Originally planned to stop at Macayos but the Litchfield location was crowded so we figured we'd try Raul and Theresas They have a good reputation from their Avondale store so how could it not be good Oh in so many ways Service was okay ambience was dreadful portions were small Had the cheese enchilada and chili relleno plate it was scrambled egg on an uncooked green chili with some kind of cheese that was unidentifiable since it had no flavor Enchilada had same cheese and was less than lackluster Wife had taco and enchilada plate and the taco shells were so tender they crumbled all over the plate As we left the only comment I could think to make was 'well we tried it" Guess if we want real authentic mexican food we'll have to travel over to Garcias Las Avenidas.
Had a bad experience with Gina who does permanent cosmetics there  Bought a Groupon  She gave me a dark left eye and a barely there right eye for upper and lower eyeliner  She was more focused on selling Mary Kay products then doing a good job with the permanent cosmetics  On her "follow up" calls to me to see how my eyeliner was she continued to try to sell Mary Kay  When I told her about my uneven eyes she said she would fix that all up on our follow up appointment for $50 - then she blew off that appointment  I arrived there to a locked door  Even though she has nothing to do with their laser work I would not go back there even though I was very interested in having some done  Too many bad vibes.
THEY STILL CANNOT GET MY ORDER RIGHT Why is mcdonalds food like crack  Hate the service  but cannot stay away.
I used to go to this car wash every other week  The staff was friendly the car wash was pretty good & pricing was in line with most other car washes  Over the last 6 months the staff has gone down hill & so has the wash quality  I drive a 2002 Nissan Xterra & I am reasonable with my expectations of going to a car wash  I realize I will always spend about 30 minutes at home touching up the missed spots as no car wash gets your car clean to the way you like it  With that said the job they have done is terrible  I went there this last Saturday my car was really dirty & covered in dirt so I actually went to a self service carwash prior to going here & I spent $5 spraying down my car & the underbelly so that it wouldn't be as difficult to clean  When I got to the carwash the first thing the gentleman that approached my car asked was "did you already clean your car" & I explained that I just washed it down but need a full cleaning  I paid $25 for an upgrade job along with the usual $1 oversize vehicle fee  When they finished my car I gave a $5 tip & left  All in all I spent $31 at this car wash  When I got home & went over my car I was astounded at how much visible dirt there still was on my car  The door jams looked like they were not even wiped down  I ended up spending TWO HOURS re-cleaning my car to get it to the level I expect when I am paying $31  Not to mention when you're waiting for your car they have one couch a couple table top seats & two massage chairs that specifically state don't sit here unless paying for a massage  SeriouslyI was shocked the first time I saw they added these chairs  People are already paying for a service & now your trying to nickle & dime them for more  This place has gone extremely down hill I have been a customer there for over 4 years now & I am done  This was my last car wash & I will find somewhere else to go  And to make things worse the quality used to be good enough that I lived right across the street & I moved a year ago about 5 miles down the road & yet I continued going here because the service was good now its not worth my time or effort as a consumer to go here.
Food was disappointing and ridiculously overpriced  The whole restaurant reeked of charcoal/mesquite and not in a good waywe should have known the food was going to taste the same  And it did Awful  I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return  And I won't  The cheese on the burger was absolutely disgusting a rubbery smoky nightmare  Stay away from this place  Not even service could save this place  If Jasper's couldn't survive in this spot this place doesn't even have a chance.
We stopped into Kozy Cactus the other day for lunch It's not one of our favorite places but they have some interesting things on the menu and they try hard to be "local" and organic At least they used to The menu we were handed had been cut in half and everything but bar food was gone We asked the waitress what had happened and she said that the management had changed but the name remained the same Since we had our Restaurantcom coupon with us we decided to staynot a great decisionWe ordered wings with sauce on the side chili onion rings and a patty melt We waited and waited some more and the place was not very busy When our wings came they were slathered in sauce but we didn't want to send them back and risk waiting another half hour Silly us the sauce was awful It seemed to be a mixture of marinara and bbq to the detriment of each Too bad because the wings themselves were decent Ken said the chili recipe was totally changed - it had no seasoning other than "hot" No onions or cheese were offered with it and our waitress was too busy chatting to come to our table for a request The onion rings were dripping with grease and like the hamburger way too saltyThere are bars that serve way better food at much lower prices I suggest you find one And don't be fooled by the name Like I said it ain't Kozy anymore.
Now typically you know what to expect from Motel 6which isn't a whole lot This one took the cake though when I walked in the office and was blasted in the face by the cigarette stench  Not to mention the pregnant girl that had marks all over her armsand each arm bandaged  The service wasn't great either  I arrived about an hour and a half prior to 3 pm which is check-in  Okay my room wasn't ready yet no big deal  We left got something to eat and came back just about at 3  Back into the office she proceeded to tell that she had to find a ready roomwait what  Then told me that the room wasn't ready yet  I made the reservations online about a month ago they could've at least had the room ready by 3And walking on a linoleum wood floor isn't really the most comfortable thing after getting out of the shower  And to top it all off (not that this couldn't happen anywhere else) but a car alarm kept going off several times during the night  Not exactly the best nights sleep is guaranteed here eitherCheck please.
07/09/2008  Just went there last week for the first and last time  I read the good reviews so I was expecting much more  I am a first generation American both my parents were German and came over in their 20's  I lived there for a few years have eaten German food all my life and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years  I really wanted to like this place as there are not many German establishments around here but this place was terrible  We were the only people in the place at 2pm and still had horrible service    We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come she would forget things we had asked her for  The waitress didn't understand German as in the German MENU options so I ordered from the menu using the English translations and she was still confused I had to POINT at the options  YES there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu  The bread was stale the schnitzel was hard there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just disgusting  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before because that is exactly what it tasted like  Plus I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 350 but showed up on my bill as 500 etc  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left disappointed  Waste of time and money I will not return  Maybe at dinner time things are better but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH  YuckOh and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.
We had went to rawhide Aug 30 and to celebrate my 10 year anniversary and to try the rattlesnake First of all it started ok until the new waiter spilled water all over my Dad's back I understand he was training but the only comp we got from them was "oh sorry he was a trainer" and we got 2 baskets of  cornbread What kind of comp  is that  They did not even offer to get his clothes dry cleaned or even dried off Next the food  Rattlesnake was no different from popcorn chicken It was not what I expected The steak and prime rib was dry and the sides were not good And I got sick the next day with diarrhea and vomiting I  spent a lot of money and was disappointed with the entertainment Overall my experience was 1 one star Not a happy customer.
WoW  one star Those are very rare for me but here's why The place its still looks really good and feel about it The waiters are ill-trained I came here with a groupon/google offer I've always wanted to see what it is all about I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix Had to get the manager who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff The food is very bland the customer service is NOT horrible but as bland as the food Good news I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money.
We saw an add for Perfection in our HOA newspaper so we decided to give them a call Appointment was easy to set up but it sounds like they have people they contract out with Once at our home they would not give us an estimate but said they would call us later with one Seemed weird but we said OK Never called us with the estimate and never returned our calls Very disappointed will never use again.
WOW the assistant manager (heavy set blonde female) seems to be farmed from Walmart or something THE most rude woman ever Employees had to apologize for her attitude.
I ordered my food online and this is what happened when i went to go pick it upI must mention it was also a very slow night i saw 2 customers and about 7 staff membersWhen i arrived to this restaurant I was not greeted with a friendly hello or how are you i was greeted with :are you the online order" I said yes and was pointed to my order which was sitting on the counter I looked inside and saw my hamburger and fries but only one order of fried pickles I told the women(dianna) at the register I had 2 orders of fried pickles and was quickly snapped back with "no you didn't" I said then can you explain to me how my order comes to $25 with a $6 order of fried pickles and a $8 burger she(dianna) pulled out the invoice waved it in my face and put it back behind the counter before i could even touch it or look at it when i said 8 and 6 only make 14 and that a paid for another order she rolled her eyes and told the cooks to make me another order then i checked my burger( i put very specific instructions that i only wanted baconlettuce and pickles no condiments or cheese) i open it up to find not only was it slathered in cheese but also mayo I told her this isn't what i ordered and had to ask her to remake it 3 times before she stopped staring at me and had it remade she then walked away no apology or anything i didn't see her again while i waited and extra 20 mins for my order Another waitress came over and was extremely sweet and double checked my food before letting me check it again she sat and talked to me while i waited and was very apologetic and i was impressed with how she handled me being a very upset customer her name was annie I also came to find out that dianna the women who was extremely rude to me was the assistant manager I am appalled at the customer service i received by this women dianna I have been in customer service for 7 years and i have never seen someone so unprofessional my suggestion to this location is to fire dianna and make annie a manager at least then you wouldn't get such awful reviews.
I hadn't been to Buca Di Beppo in a few years and I won't be going back for at least a few more (until the memories of my experience fade at least) First of all it's incredibly expensive I understand it's meant to be served family style but my fiancee and I ordered a single dish and had a coupon for another free one a small order of garlic bread and two waters Our bill: $32 - for ONE dish and garlic bread It's ridiculousSecond the service was terrible 30 minutes after we were seated we finally had the chance to order This isn't to say the waitress didn't come to the table she did It's just that when she did she was in such a hurry that all we could eek out before she was rushing away was that we wanted two waters We were there for an hour and a half for spagetti I will just make this at home from now onThird the way the restaurant is laid out it's VERY loud There was a party of about 10 people next to us and my fiancee and I couldn't even hear each other talk So we say in silence Now this is not the restaurants fault but these people were OBNOXIOUS The management should have said something And finally the food is terrible It reminded me of food made at summer camp - you know what I'm talking about - the mass produced kind with standard pasta and sauce My fiancee also noted that his chicken parmigiana was terrible and that it's better at Olive Garden A restaurant I will be sticking with from here on out :).
Yes I have been here beforeNow for a person who has been to Italy and has worked in restaurants for years I think I can give a pretty fair review:My Girlfriend and I went there very hungry on a Friday night they were not busy nor slow about average for October in Phoenix We called to make a reservation and when we came in we were seated without menus Now working in restaurants this is almost un-heard of but like I said we were hungryThe waiter came over and asked if we would like something to drink (A little rudely) but like I keep saying we were hungry Since we didn't have any menus including a wine menu we asked the waiter to see some menus He proceeded to only bring a wine menuAfter we made are choice we laid the menu down in clear vision of the waiter (A definite sign to come back to the table) He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders (Perfectly fine) Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the storyWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiterNOTHING We decided to try to flag him down and he was having none of it We then got up from the table and left Walking right passed the so called manager (Older lady with short brown hair) she told us to have a good night as if we just had a great dinnerWe were so hungry we needed to go somewhere else On the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment I called Cristo's and asked to speak to the manager The lady who told us to have a good night answered and told us she was the head manager and then proceeded to tell us that not giving people who sit down at a restaurant menus unless they ask I had never been so offended in my life A straight up LIE I could not hear any more Hopefully the owner reads this and make this right I am not seeking anything free I just don't want this to happen to anyone else  EVER AGAIN.
Rude management and office staff very slow response times from maintenance team (if they came at all) and ridiculous charges at move-out Thankfully I was able to talk them out of the extra charges since they were based on nonsense The complete lack of help from the office staff leaky roof frequently shut-off water and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle The only redeeming quality was the lovely Gainey neighborhood and close proximity to the Hayden Greenbelt No thanks never again and I don't suggest you rent there either.
Horrible service I walked in and waited The restaurant wasn't that busy and I could see there were tables available  The lady in front of me had 8 in her party the manager seemed very stressed when she told him the size of her party  He had told the lady I don't think I have a place for you because I don't have a full staff  This was on a Saturday morning and right before the holidays  He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine  He said somewhat rudely "You can sit down and wait  I'll be right with you"  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out Never eating at that Coco's  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did.
Now that I no longer have to deal with this place I can finally write a review  The day I stepped in I just came here to get a prescription so I could order blue contacts  Nationwide Vision was the first place on the list of places my insurance worked with so I naturally thought first meant best  Boy was I wrong  First of all they have you change out your contacts in the bathroom (gross)  Not only is that disgusting but also highly unsanitary  Second when I went in for my exam the doctor tried to convince me I had all these things wrong with my eyes that I didn't  He pretty much scammed me into believing I had to wear glasses for a while and then come back and get a prescription  So now I had to buy a $200 pair of glasses on top of contacts (Oh and a $40 fitting fee)  When I came back I had the SAME RESULTS on the test (because there was nothing wrong the whole time)  I also got hit with the news that they had ordered the wrong prescription for my left eye and that I would have to be coming back yet again once they were in  Granted the company did realize this was their mistake and covered the second box of contacts it is still ridiculous and time-consuming  I am so happy I never have to work with these people again  I will be promptly going back to my old eye doctor  She isn't covered by my insurance but is still WAY cheaper than a trip to these incompetent morons.
We walked in at 650pm on a weekday night and discovered that they close at 7pm Went immediately over to LUX It looked nice but without evening hours this place is giving away business Until they change their hours they will rarely get our business.
Have been to  El Chorro's many times in the past but always outdoors or at the bar Went with good friends on Xmas Eve and had some of the worst service ever It's not like they don't know what to expect on a holiday Everyone had a reservation and the menu was fixed Nevertheless the service was painfully slow (we were there over 3 hours) They made numerous mistakes They couldn't keep our wine or water glasses full They even claimed to have run out of potatoes ReallyYou're a Phoenix icon not a fly by night franchise Get it together.
I always loved Johnny Rockets the food the fun - my daughter always gets up and dances with the crew Tonight- not so much - The service was horible They lost our order and the manager didn't even have the courage to come out and appologize They gave me a pathetic discount which didn't begin to make up for the 1/2 hour I lost this evening The worst part for me was I was in a great mood when I went there even though we waited for 20 minutes to get in But it's hard to maintain your cool when you people around you who came in 15 minutes after you get served first I understand that mistakes happen believe me they happen to me in my business all the time That's when the manager has to come over and own up to the error and appologize If you go there share this review with them and maybe they will improve because the food really is good and normally I like the place a lot but shame on them tonight.
I lived in unit #1078 (which is in the north east corner of 13th Ave/ Van Buren) from April '11- May '13 Had it not been for my job being just 1 mile away I would have chosen to stay else where Paying $775 for a spacious 2x2 in down town is almost too good to be true If your ok with the extreme noise pollution by walkers (the occassional drug user who likes to scream "F U N*ggers" the run aways the homeless & the poor) or the heavy rail train just 6 streets west that blows its horn at exactly 11:31 every night (& doesn't ever miss a beat) the ambulances fire truck & PD blaring their horns and of course the screeching of tires as they take turns too quickly then this place is for you Of course after a month or two you just learn to block out the auto noise Compared to it's surrounding areas Legacy Bungalows is a beautiful place to live The state park is next door and if you catch it just right during the day there isn't too many homeless people camping out In all fareness PD does stay posted (most nights) @ the front of the office and he occasionally comes around checking door knobs and wonders thru the halls which gave me a false sense of security I awoke to gun shots back in May of '12 Two gunmen were opening fire to someone on the north end of 13th Ave & were using my bedroom walls and balcony post as a shield We picked up the bullets the next day and turned them in to the office to hopefully hand them over as evidence to PD even though we never did hear a cop car come by after we called 911 the night before Things got progressively worse since In October of '12 our unit was robbed between the hours of 8P-11P by a neighbor that lived in the back of the complex We were 1 of 3 units that got hit that night The front office was nice enough to offer another unit but in a not so well lit area And unfortunately we had just signed on to another 6 month lease so leaving all together wasn't an option We learned to sleep w/ 1 eye open Having people knock on our window in the early evenings only made us more observant I have nothing but nice things to say of the professional staff @ the front office My issues were always immediately taken care of & it was nothing ever really major The grounds were always well manicured & parking was never a headache even though stalls weren't assigned The pool area & gym was of a decent size & well kept The business center and laundry room (even though all units came with full size washers and dryers) were a nice convenience I don't recommend this place if you have another option If safety is @ the utmost importance to you then look else where.
My wife and i went for lunch the service was so bad 15 minutes for a server to ask what we needed her words ( what do you need to drink) told manager the service was bad he said well maybe next time it will be better sorry and just at this location at the chandler mall.
This place had a lot of hypeone of the best rated restaurants in town We were extremely disappointed The service was terrible we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented After another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked outand walked down the road to Chelseaswhich was solid.
This is a nice enough hotel and extremely convenient to a number of bars and restaurants - walking distance for many The rooms are clean and comfortable but the decor is fairly dated There are minimal food/drink options on the property itself but the limited poolside menu wasn't bad However and the reason for the one star is the horde of pre-teen boys staying here for a baseball tournament They pretty much terrorized the place all weekend and their parents/guardians did nothing to contain them We had a room close to the pool and could hear them screaming all afternoon - even inside with the AC on Other friends had a room near a large grassy area and they were playing outside their room all afternoon  more screaming We left and went to Blanco's for a drink While we loved the location not sure we'd come back if this is who they cater to.
Breakfast is all pre-cooked  Ham boiled  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior  No special orders here  Not that cheap either  Just fast that's all.
I signed up specifically to review this hotel I have been staying at the Pointe hotels since I was a child My mother had her wedding reception dinner here nearly 30 years ago It's not the nicest resort in town but it's usually a good value and always fun for allThat being said 7/8/2010 will be the last stay for any of my family  at either of the Pointe resorts First of all I booked a two bedroom casita in March and prepaid for it so it would be a reduced rate It ended up being $20 less then the actual rate but oh well At least I had the security of knowing I had the roomLiving in Arizona summer birthdays are not always easy- it's so hot It has been our tradition to celebrate my birthday and now my daughters birthday at the Pointe Resorts The staff has always been accomodating to guests and making us feel special Yesterday was Cassidys 2nd birthday We booked the casita specifically so we would have room for both grandmas to stay and a little room for some family and friends to enjoy Cassidys birthday When we arrived- my pre-booked casita was not available They told me I had only booked the queen one I found the confirmation and they realized they were in err "Ok that's indeed what you booked but We don't have one available right now They are cleaning the downstairs portion of the casita but you may enter thru the king entrance and we will let  you know when it's ready"Well at least I have the room right So we decide to do this When we unloaded all of our belongings and entered the open portion of the casita it was cramped to say the least But at least it was cool But there were 6 of us with some other family on the way I asked the maid to put my cake in the fridge downstairs I got a glimpse of the downstairs portion and was in shock Someone had a major party on there the night before- like furniture overturned bottles everywhere sticky floors- an absolute disaster No way would these two poor maids get this cleaned up by 5 I vaguely remember the front desk guy saying the guests who were there had a late checkout Yea I see why)We call the desk and to my surprise we were moved- to a 2-bedroom casita right across the way  But why not in the first place Before we'd unloaded our things etc But the front desk did say they would help up carry our things across the car port And that we were closer to the pool Wow Super nice bell boy came and helped us out We were settled by 5:30- but that hour and a half of unsettlement for my daughter was not good If you have or have had a two year old you know what I mean)When my husband called the desk this AM- we wanted a late checkout and maybe just an apologyhe was given the run around by a very rude manager They didn't do late checkouts(HMMMM) Did we want to stay another night in a suite room for $69 LOL at that(they had a coupon for next stay in a suite room for $79)  I got on the phone and told him the same story I've just told and he laughed at me several times and mocked me when I said I am a service manager at a large corporation and I usually don't complain He mocked me about having children His tone of voice was sarcastic He was absolutely awful He said that the GM was too busy to help us and wouldn't be available to talk They also charged us for phone calls when we had paid for the value pack Including the long distance one when I asked him for the corporate # And do they not have a 1-800# I didn't expect much but I don't expect to be laughed atAbsolutely unacceptable I see in reviews on here and trip advisor they have service issues The water park was dirty and unattended to Service/Food in park -so so I used to love this place and I'm sorry that a tradition is over Oh well I'll go to the AZ Grand next year Don't stay here.
Can you give zero stars cuz that's all his place deserves Will not come back.
YUCK Craving Mexican food so my friend and I decided to stop at this place for some burritos We were impressed with the large selection at the salsa bar When we got our stale store-bought rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands It was a mess I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us "one" taco She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her "one" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus Her angry attitude scared us so we no longer wanted to look at the menu We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant I would not recommend dining at this place The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse Waitress with vile attitude and crappy food equals a no win situation You're better off dining at Taco Bell.
Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly And i informed the manager of it as well I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep I wouldnt pick this one the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say But the Train noise is just unbearable I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable Stay Elsewhere I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
It only gets one star because yes there are decent things underneath it all Yes its dirty and unsanitary there was a cockroach in one of the bins But the worst are the employees never met more rude people in my life The guy bringing out bins yelled at me after grabbing one item and it was my first time so I didn't know you weren't allowed to grab until it was all out He talked to the customers like they were dogs "NO DON'T TOUCH" and the cashiers talk about hormone driven teens worse than ever We got into one line and the cashier told me I was allowed to go to the next cashier and the next cashier was making out with another employee at the register And she tells us to go back to the other cashier and yells at the girl saying "can't you see I'm busy" She didn't even bag the items she just handed me the plastic bags RUDE.
I effing HATE this placeI will only come here for a band I just can not missTickets - Online in advance is more expensive than buying at the door They'll charge you like $6 for buying online & another undisclosed $3 for will call Lying cheating bastardsLines & waiting - I didn't have to wait at all There were barely any people there yet I got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stageFrisking & pat downs - These will be done by a same gendered person Girls they'll want to look in your purseThis is pretty much against the 4th Amendment:"The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated" But if you bitch they have the right to refuse service/entrance FunDecor & cleanliness - It's pretty dirty everywhere But that's to be expected Lots of people coming & going all the time You'll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed Pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location Don't even go into the restrooms if you don't have to you'll wish you had a hazsmat suit on YuckDrinks - There's a bar & they don't separate people under 21 I imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :DHeat - It's constantly hot No matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat There was 1 lousy fan blowing It might as well not even have been thereMusic - For some reason between bands they play weird music that doesn't fit the style you're there to see I saw Fireworks Saves the Day Hellogoodbye & New Found Glory They played 80's pop music OkSound - The sound didn't suck as much as other reviews led me to believe It's up to the band to make the sound people get it right Hellogoodbye made sure they sounded good Saves the Day not so muchSecurity - Never enough There were some big beefy dudes up front to push back or catch the crowd surfers I saw 2 guys actually in the crowd With all the moshing going on that's not gonna cut it People got kicked in the head elbowed spit on stepped on pushed almost crushed & even I almost got into a fight w/ a short asshole mosher that might have been a guy perhaps when his balls drop Prepare to leave with bruisesBasically this place is like an armpit or perhaps the donkeys ass of venuesFail.
Jesus what a dive  Not necessarily a bad thing but just dont expect anything more Greg Louganis stylee Cheap drinks always welcomeEverything on the menu is fried bar food to be expectedWalking through the smoking section just to get in trashyTrivia on Friday while the playoffs were on wtf  I thought this was a sports bar  They mute a playoff game to do trivia   Why the hell would anyone go here if Half Moon and Teakwoods are nearby  Screw this joint  I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a better bar with better TVs  Weak Sauce.
I frequent the Zoyo location near my house so I was happy to see this location as I was driving around  That was until I got insideThe flavors were different from those I have tried so I asked for a couple of sample cups  The staff member on duty handed me one so I went and tried one of the flavors and came back as I wanted to try another before making my decision  I asked for another and the staff member after pretending not to hear me quipped back in a very rude tone of voice "one per customer"  I was completely taken aback and wasn't sure that I heard him correctly given his tone  I asked what he had said and he repeated it almost yelling at me  Other customers noticed as well and looked over at him with a shocked look on their facesNeedless to say I will never be back here again  A shame the location closer to my home is always so friendly.
Since the day Zaytoon opened I've been a regular customer If I happened to be in the neighborhood I would stop there every time Many times I'd driven across town specifically to go to the restaurant it was that goodThere was one thing that separated them from all the rest The bread Much to my dismay after driving across town one evening last week to have dinner I was given their "new" pita When I asked where the regular bread was I was told the new owners/manager didn't want to be bothered making that bread any longer Here is a perfect example of shortsightedness In order to not be bothered with what I guess is an extra step or two in making a superior product the customer base will now begin to disappear When I said to the girl that that was the main reason I come across town for their restaurant she told me that many people were upset and complaining and said they would no longer be coming to the restaurant I told her she could add me to that list Their hummus recipe also appears to have changed And not for the better They are now simply a mediocre Mediterranean restaurant like all the others.
I had eaten here a couple years ago and it was decent food and service I think the place has gone downhill When you walk into a place that is empty I'm a Friday night be afraid Prime rib was way overcooked and fatty Veggies were mushy I was wearing nice jeans and a blouse and I felt overdressed compared to other patrons  We won't be back.
Drinks are a bit over priced The food is above average bar food My problem is with the doorstaff it seems like everytime we are there the doorstaff is hustling me/one of my friends about dumb stuff [IDs expiration dates footwear etc]  They also seem to have a proclivity towards abuses of power I've seen the doorstaff get into altercations where they clearly had the upper hand/control of the situation and still continued to use violence [for fun] Most recently they had a guy on the ground on Ash in a headlock and still continued to kick him Sorry but I need a de-stressing waterhole.
Worst Customer Service EverMy husband (G) went to this center today to get some screws for a microwave we were given after striking out at Ace Home Depot etc G told the "Customer Service Rep" what he needed and after searching his computer a bit he declared that he wasn't able to help G WITH ATTITUDE - like G was putting him out by asking him to do his jobG asked to speak to the manager in the hopes that he might be able to get some actual help and was told that no he wouldn't get the manager for G because G had an attitude and needed to leave the store Keep in mind that my husband hadn't said anything rude or raised his voice He had simply asked to speak with a manager G was floored what had he done to deserve this After he left the center he called and unfortunately got the same rude employee Employee said he still wouldn't get a manager but eventually gave in after declaring that the manager probably would refuse to talk to G The manager did come on the line and when G explained what had happened the Manager (THE MANAGER) told G that it is a store policy that if an employee determines that a customer is out of line rude etc that they have sole authority to have them removed from the premises What kind of BS is this Apparently at Sears Parts & Repair the customer is always WRONG It is amazing to me that after all the money we have dropped in Sears that not only did this kind of disrespectful thing happen but that the Manager actually claims this is ok and store policy Really Store policyI will be writing a formal complaint to Sears Corp and see what they think of this ridiculous "store policy".
Horrible Service I went to pick up my orders and I ended waiting some time but no one came to attend me even after noticing me at the front door which is very awkward So I called the restaurant number and told that I am waiting at front door only then people came to attend me When I asked about that I didn't get proper response instead they were rude Actually I ordered some fish cakes and fried rice when I asked about whats there in my to go box I was told that it has fried rice and something in  thai which I didnt understand  When I asked is it fish cake the lady told you are the only one who ordered fried rice so its your order then later I found out that they mentioned the thai name for the fish cake But I feel its a rude behavior not sure how they are still in the business And food was not great especially fish cake was oily and had raw smell  I will never step in there in future There are lot of other better thai restaurants near by so avoid this place.
Do not go to this restaurant I bought 4 ceviche tostadas for 15 dollars and they charged me 150 dollars  After that they charged me 15 dollars more because they made a wrong calculation the first time  Don Poncho pretended to give me a refund electronically and gave me a fake receipt  When I checked my balanced I was missing 150+ dollars from my checking account  Called Don Poncho and told me that he did not know how to work the system and refused to give me back my money  He never acknowledge that I was going to be missing 150 dollars from my checking account and was very reluctant to admit it and NEVER EVER APOLIGIZED  I was charged an overdraft fee from my bank and Mr Poncho said that was not his problema Very RUDE He pretended not to know what was going on and told me to go ahead and call the police He told me to bring back my checking card so he could deduct another 150 dollars from my own account which made no sense to me whatsoever He said he did not want to refund me on the spot and this is what business usually do give you a refund  He also refused to refund me the 15 dollars for the tostadas even though I wasted 5 hours trying to get my money back and I still do not have it DO NOT EAT HERE.
I stopped by here recently around 9am and the donuts I got tasted like they were made a week ago Stale and old I thought they were supposed to make them fresh regularly I love Krispy Kreme donuts but this location seems to be run by a Dunkin' Donuts undercover spy hellbent on tainting the good name of Krispy KremeThis saddens me greatly.
I have been to several Mellow Mushroom locations and recommended this place to my co-workers It was by far the worse experience I have ever had A group of eight people and very few other customers we received poor service It took a while to receive our drinks and once we got our food after waiting for over an hour several personal pizzas were delivered to our table UNCOOKED They returned their pizzas and the second pizzas they brought back were not what they order They still even charged those guest Several guest had major stomach aches from the uncooked food A big disappointment for Mellow Mushroom.
Server was rude and unfriendly Place wasn't very clean either Don't go expecting them to be accommodating at all if you request their items to be made differently than as stated on menu Very disappointed.
I just can't even believe you took a perfectly respectable concept like gourmet nachos and threw it all away  What did a nacho ever do to you  Will I come back here  Bring back the melted cheese goodness and then maybe  Who wants a late night bowl o soup  Tsk tsk.
I used to be a regular here at Gallo Blanco although I have to say this place has gotten a little brazen We took our sister in law for her birthday and arranged for a table of six we also asked the hostess if the outside tables were first come first serve She stated to us it was first come first serve We purchased a margarita at the bar and asked for an extra shot of Tequilla in which the bartender charged me $600 plus the $500 for the Margarita then did a no sale and just collected the cash We then proceeded to sit outside and have our cocktail the hostess immediately came outside and told us in a very rude manner " you can't sit there" I know you have reservations  but all these tables on the outside are reserved" the hostess left  we were miffed we asked another waitress if the tables were first come first serve and she said yes We decided to take our dinner party to Hillstone where people treat you with dignity I guess Gallo Blanco  has such great crowd that they feel they don't have to have any decorum Sad for you guys it's not worth it anymore.
First off this review is coming from someone who has been (and current is) a Regus tenant for 3+ years in both San Francisco and Phoenix  We most likely will continue to be a tenant in San Francisco as our company enjoys the ease of transitioning into this kind of office and enjoys furnished office setup that Regus offers even though you're paying a premium price for those services  And trust me Regus will charge you for everything from the office phone (separate fees for the handset and actual phone line) internet access black/color copies scanning mandatory kitchen fees and garage parking (optional although fairly affordable here)  We initially locked into a year long lease and was at this Phoenix location for about two full years  I didn't really have any major problems with this Phoenix location until I took over the management of our company's billing system  When you initially sign the lease you have to commit to how many phone handsets and internet lines you want  You pay for these office features like it is an a la carte menu just like a restaurant  What I was not thrilled about is that we eventually had to downsize our operations from 2 people to 1 person at this Phoenix location during our initial lease and we were still forced to pay for two phone lines and two internet connections  Keep in mind that the monthly total for a phone line and an internet connection amounts to about $200/month (and that does not include the long distance usage fee you incur on your phone) so it is a fairly expensive feature  I figured that Regus would have been reasonable enough to help us out but it was stated in our original contract we are responsible for the fees so I guess they have a "gotcha" on that one  But when we accidentally forget to cancel our lease our lease got rolled over for another six months and we were still being charged internet/phone charges for two people when we obviously only have one person occupying the office  I feel Regus need to use some common sense and ensure that company's are only being charged for the amount of people that occupy the office especially when it comes to an automatic renewal  Sadly this location does not act on the side of the tenants who occupy their facilities  Talk about ensuring the client gets shaftedMy second major gripe about this location is with center manager  Valinda Evans  Since at the time our company in the US only had two employees and two offices we felt it was more productive to have two people in the same Regus office (in San Francisco)  Therefore we decided to leave the Phoenix office unoccupied with three months left on our lease  I understand that you have to abide to the terms of your lease but I referenced to Ms Evans of our unique situation and it wasn't until three weeks later after my two e-mail inquiries that I received a response  Three weeks is highly unacceptable when you have a situation where you are in a position to leave your Regus office unoccupied and notification is made to the center manager    I would have liked a little bit of flexibility and perhaps be able to transfer our Regus financial obligation to our SF office or pay an early termination fee  Anything reasonable would have been helpful but the only reasonable option I had was to "take additional space and sign and new contract"  She also added that "there is really nothing that I can do unless you take additional space in another location"   Wow so not helpful  I was not seeking to get out of our leasing obligation just to find a way to make it a little more convenient so we do not let an office sit dormant for three months which was such a waste  If you are considering this Regus space in downtown Phoenix I would highly recommend seeking other office options  Phoenix has plenty of real estate in downtown and it should not be too difficult to find a sufficient alternativeTip: Regus will not notify you prior to the termination of your signed lease If you fail to notify them for another extension or to leave all together they will automatically renew your lease for something like six months so beware that you have to notify them a certain amount of months prior to the termination of your lease.
I have given this place a few chances over the last month or so (twice with my man and once with the girls) The female servers we had are so RUDE It's like we are interrupting their day I don't get it Maybe they want a different kind of clientele(olderfamiliesboring) We aren't demanding and tip well They would rather stand by the bar and talk with each other and the manager What a joke The drinks (when we could get service) and ambiance are pretty good We have had three different servers and they all seemed to not really care Too bad so sad Next.
Not sure what everyone sees in these pies Not worth the money.
in from the Midwest staying in old Scottsdale  nice town great shops to stroll through took three friends to eat and wanted Mexican food  close to the border so it should be good  right NOT   fajitas wernt hot  didn't sizzle at all  Mexican pizza bland with little flavor  the lady got a burrito and they charged for all the sides that was to come with the order entrée and for a 102 pound lady I thought that a 1550 meal was ridiculous  when it was to be 850  top shelf margarita was half the size of the same price as at home and wasn't as good  mi pueblo real in IOWA is ten times the food of this place  and im a concrete contractor so im not a cook and could  do better with bag food from walmarts or frys cold frozen section  sorry if you eat here.
Food not worth the wait Stood in line for 50 minutes just to order Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line Mentioned just how busy they have been Saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation Yep the entire time only one of their two order windows was open One  I guess I'm the sucker and the joke's on me.
Second time here and equally disappointed as the first time Food is tasteless service is so-so and I find the prices to be excessive This is really a very touristy place to go in Cave Creek If you want great Mexican in Scottsdale go to Los Sombreros a family owned authentic place on Scottsdale Rd.
Would give them a zero star but can't  Pizza is at a two starbuffalo wings were okay Service was a 2 out of 10 ten being the highest Front desk guy was rude STAY AWAY.
I wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything It didn't start off bad we made reservations and the hostess was friendly She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on When our waiter came to take our orders we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter This is where it went downhill as from here on out our waiter had an attitude As a first course we had the option of salad or soup We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us (Extra $10 really) The salad was average nothing to write home about For our second course both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish which was disappointing (Again when placing our order the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself) The prime rib was average thickness about half an inch and a rather large portion but the flavor was lackluster Even the horseradish which my husband loves didn't help For dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor This wasn't) The cheesecake was good but my husband would eat any cheesecakeThen we waited And we waited The waiter had disappeared on us We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table My husband had to flag him down and request our bill Again the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree make both the paper and ink and then write our receipt in calligraphy After a few minutes he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and leftWe won't be back.
Andrea had a horrible attitude from the start Every flower suggestion was turned down and the push towards roses was HUGELY obvious Their "contract" was a piece of paper that said I would owe $___ amount by a specified date with no promise of services When I questioned the lack of verbiage promising services/product in exchange for my money Andrea became enraged that I "didn't trust them" and threw me out of her office Don't be swayed by cheap prices their service was junk and Andrea's lack of social skills reeked throughout the meeting Contracts protect the consumer AND the vendor-run from these people.
If I could give them zero stars I wouldIn June LA Fitness withdrew my monthly fee FIVE TIMES That's correct: they charged me my monthly dues FIVE TIMES within 30 days it was never reimbursedIt only gets worseAround the same time I moved out of the area and called to cancel my membership They told me it had to be done online I went online and it was literally impossible to cancel that way For fear that they would continue to withdraw money I cancelled my debit card and got a new oneThe harassment beginsI'm not exaggerating: every week once or twice a week I received a call from one of their many call centers around the country calling to tell me that there is a "problem with my credit card" and that I owe them money The first call I explained that no I do NOT owe them money that in fact THEY owe ME money and that I would like to cancel my membership immediately I was told that I have to do it online I told them that this was not possible They told me they'd "note my account"At least A DOZEN more calls followed over the next four month (FOUR MONTHS) all "informing" me that I "owe them money" then me stating that I want to f***ing cancel then them saying to go online then me saying - even asking to walk me through it and being told they don't know how - that's not an option then them saying they'd "note my account"Then there was today Yet another call Broken record I'm getting fed up and I threatened to contact the Better Business Bureau (which I will do next) I ask if she can read English as there MUST be something "noted on my account" yes No Nothing NOTHING Which leads me to believe that these assholes were just trying to get more money from meThe most frustrating part: she literally cancelled my account over the phone in about 15 seconds (I assume I received an immediate email confirmation) Absolutely no reason for those assholes to harass me for 4 monthsOh the kicker: the email said I still owe them $79 Fact is technically they owe me over $100 but I'm willing to take the loss to get these assholes out of my lifeDO NOT DO NOT DO NOT give this company your credit card infowhich is the only way to joinso FIND ANOTHER GYM I realize that my complaint is corporate's issue and not Scottsdale's but there is no where else to Yelp this and Scottsdale is where I signed up.
Over priced Stop for a quick bite before a flight out of town Never heard of the restaurant before and would never recommend this place now  I was charged for the"complimentary" tortillas and guacamole - $395 for one person The sirloin entree I ordered was tough and dried out and was only about 5oz The majority of the $1795 entree was room temperature refried beans Save your money and go to Taco Bell.
Huge waste of our time I made a reservation and requested a romantic table for two When we got there the hostess sat us next to a table of 4 who were extremely loud I get thatthey were all having fun We asked to move to a table outside but was told that they were all reserved  This wasn't a very big place but the outside area was very pretty and was lit by candlelight We sat for maybe 5 min and the hostess came back and gave us a wine list and thennothing We waited and waited hostess came back again and asked if we had questions about the wine list I said I did and she said she would try to answer but didn't know much about wine Hmmmm ok Still no server At that point we then decided to leave  Very disappointed for a couple of reasons1 I would not think it would be so difficult to be acknowledged by a server after all they are there to take care of our dining accomadations2 We were on vacation and this place was very out of the way  We waisted part of our evening and when vacationing that is the last thing I want to do3  Hostess never said"Is there a problem"  She saw us leave we walked right past her.
No organic 2% milk which is in the farthest corner of the planet from the entrance because no one would go into a grocery store for just milk rightAnd the cashier couldn't have been any more rude No thank you no smile actually even seemed annoyed that we were disturbing his quiet evening since there were hardly any customers n all were mostly going thru the self checkout.
I knew better but It was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles They were all jammed in the three checkouts each with one frazzled clerk I left my purchases there along with another customer So long Sears.
I eat at a different Village Inn often I've even ordered catering for work events   I was in the area and decided to stop by this store  Unfortunately they fell very short on providing acceptable service   I should have known there may be a problem when I walked in  There were 12 people waiting in line to pay and leave  There was one woman complaining about something to the assistant manager  I'm not sure about what but I heard the assistant manager sarcastically and loudly say in front of everyone in the lobby "Oh  I assure you ma'am I did"  She was obviously pissed off and she stormed out   As for me I waited 15 minutes at the table without a beverage  In the meantime two other tables after me were seated and had theirs  I went to the front to complain but there were no employees at the register or podium  Someone finally came up  I asked to speak with the manager  She said he was in the kitchen but would get him for me  It was the assistant manager I saw before  I told him about the slow service  All he did was tuck in his shirt while saying to me "I am so sorry"  He made no offer to rectify the problem so I walked out.
I visited the Sugar Bowl this weekend and really wanted to love it I was so excited to sample their delicious treats However before I could even raise the spoon to my mouth I discovered not one not two but three roaches roaming around the restaurant Gross I will not be returning.
Service by the waitress (Laura) and cleanliness were fair  Problem became when I had asked for my eggs to be scrambled with the cheese in them while they cook not melted on top of the eggs after  Laura assured me no problem  Eggs came out and the cheese had been melted on top after the eggs had been cooked and then mixed up with a forkLaura asked if they could remake the eggs and I politely responded that I just never feel comfortable sending food back  Asked if they would just charge me for the pancakes bacon and coffee  Again she asked if they could remake the eggs  I said no thanks and she responded she would get the managerManager came over asked if they could remake the eggs and I again responded no thank you  She said they would take the eggs off the bill  Brings the bill and in fact did not take the eggs off but also instead of charging me the $100 upcharge for the bacon that came with the meal charged me $299 for a side of baconI had to ask for the manager to come back and argue with her about the charge for the bacon and have her bring over a menu to show her the upcharge was only $100  (She apparently as a manager does not know their own menu)  She gave up at trying to listen to me at this point and just said "Well we are just comping the meal"Very annoying  I am always happy to pay for what I eat but shouldn't be charged for food that was not prepared as requestedWon't be back.
We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus Geez I have no idea where the good reviews came from The pizza had zero sauce on it it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well We won't be trying this place again We'll stick with Spinato's.
Poor food  Vastly overpriced  Uneducated undertrained though friendly staff  Not a single original item on the menu and every thing on the menu is served better somewhere elseTwo eggrolls for $8 is an outrage  The pad thai was soupy/wet  The mongolian beef had ok flavor but the beef was cheap and chewy  Small portions all around  My party of four left lunch disappointed unsatisfied and $70 poorer.
If you're like me you're reading reviews not to make a decision whether to visit but only to check in on poor old Chris-Town like you would an elderly relative  Sure enough most of the commenters grew up with Chris-Town and are at least a little saddened by this withered husk this pathetic atrociously-named sad sack of a former mall that is Phoenix SpectrumOh I remember the good times too  Chris-Town was probably the first mall I ever went to back when malls were a relatively new idea I suppose  (Come to think of it I probably saw some of my first movies at the old UA theater out front before it became a better place to watch gangbangers make out with their underage girlfriends)  I remember going to Dillard's with my grandmother hiding in the circular clothing racks running my hand along rows of impossibly silky blouses  I remember Santa Claus and the sand castles and the excellent pastrami at the Miracle Mile deli  I remember how it used to smell when the doors would whoosh open and you'd walk in out of the heat -- like a combination of clean tile floors and cool breeze and birthday cake  Miracle Mile beat its retreat long ago of course  The once-mighty Dillard's became Dillard's Outlet a gigantic disheveled storage shed for hundreds of piles of failed clothing which was picked over by masses of morbidly obese ThirstBuster-clutching vultures and then eventually went the way of the sand castles  And the smell  It's closer to gym socks fryer grease and despairAnd desperate is exactly how I would categorize most Chris-Town shoppers these days  The clientele along with the facade has aged disgracefully  This new sweaty mob of bargain hunters barges ahead blindly wielding their strollers like cow catchers each accompanied by an entourage of saggy-diapered Kool Aid-mouthed gremlins  Which is hardly a surprise: with Wal-Mart CostCo and more recently Super Target as its chief ballast it stands to reason that Chris-Town's main loyalty would be among those looking to spend as little as possible on the greatest possible quantity and there is plenty of that to be found in the poverty-line neighborhoods nearby It's senseless to compare as some have done Chris-Town with Scottsdale Fashion Square or even Metrocenter  Those are still malls  Chris-Town is just the bones of a giant -- a concisely depressing reminder that one can never go home again.
FOOD- DECENTCUSTOMER SERVICE- HORRENDOUSThe worst restaurant experience we've ever had We've been to Rainforest Cafe before We did'nt think the service was going to be this deplorable We ordered an appetizer that never came until we finally flagged down the floor manager 50 minutes later That's after he passed by our table several times as we sat with empty plates no food and with two hungry chilldren We were told the appetizers were never entered into the system The manager removed the appetizer from our billAfter staring at empty glasses for an addtional 30 minutes the waitress finaly arrived and asked if we were ready for dessert We asked for the bill After finaly filling up my wife's iced tea upon request she then spilled the entire glass into my wife's expensive purse(purchased just 1 month ago) She then began wiping off my son's comic bookinstead of the purse as my wife pulled out her cell phone which was completely submerged in iced tea She said sorry and then gave my wife her rag so she could try and dry off her own purse We were then given the bill which we paid and left in disgust We immediately tried the phone and discovered it was ruined and not operational We went back and explained the situtaion to the manager who returned our money and reffered us to the district manager He in turn reffered us to corporate 3 days later we finally recieved a phone call from Emily who stated we had to send them the old phone and they would only reimburse us for its original value We explained the phone is discontinued as cell phones typicaly are in a matter of months and we could replace it for much cheaper as she was due for an upgrade through our carrier Emily insisted the new phone was not her concern only the replacement of the original phone It was also not a concern to her we were not seeking to have the purse replaced or cleaned just the phone One of the worst customer service experiences we've ever had Very minimal attempts to rectify a bad situation brought upon their own staff.
The poor quality of the products alone makes this place not worth it Processed cheese on a breakfast bagel Not sure what happened to this egg pattyThe bagels taste good but are chewy and too dry on the outside Sure it's cheap food but you get what you pay for: A slimy breakfast bagel.
It's a Friday at midnight The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on YelpHOW COME THERE'S NO ONE HERE Where is everyone Why is it so quiet I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people But no empty Sad.
Why would anyone pay money for food like this.
I've been a regular customer of Boulders on Broadway for 4+ years  Over that time my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there who always remembered our names our favorite dishes and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive ever changing listIn the past year or so however this place has gone downhill fast  The online beer list never matches the beers on the chalkboard so it's hard to order without checking with your server about what's ACTUALLY going to be on tap  They also no longer have prices posted so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a "premium" beer when no indication of this was given on the menu  Unfortunately in our past 3 visits we've sat for 15-20 minutes before actually being visited by a server  On one occasion this summer I found a fly in my salad  Their employee turnover has also been unreasonably high as of lategone are those friendly servers who remembered our names and made us feel welcome  In the past year we've had a different server on every visit and every time they seemed brand new (didn't know the beer list forgetting our order etc)  The final straw was that in our last two visits the servers have been not only incompetent but downright rude even insulting people at our table to our facesSorry Bouldersbased on our history I've given you too many chances  No more.
I'd like to begin this review with a warningWARNING: Oscar the Grouch works at this location I pull up to the drive-thru at 5am this morning to order a drink for me and my friend Little miss Grouchy gets on the other end full of attitude and scorn She asks for my order and interrupts me as I am in the middle of my statement saying "is that all" with a snappy tone Which completely throws me off I finish my order but can't believe her tone the whole time she is talking with me I drive around to the window and she got my drink wrong (maybe she should have LISTENED to the whole thingany ways I hand back my drink so she can make another one and she slams the drink into the trash and refuses to look at me She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink I say "thanks have a good morning" she slams the window on me I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open When those 100 odd stores closed a few years ago this one should have been one of themThis isn't the first time I have come to this location and had to correct my order at the window in fact getting my order RIGHT is an exception I can't believe a company like Starbucks would have stand for such low quality in service.
Got the chicken lo mein Paid nearly $10 and ended up throwing the take out in the trash after 3-4 bites:( not sure if I can give it a second chance The staff was friendly on the plus side.
I don't get the obsession with this place The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me.
Terrible  My wife and I went there early afternoon on ThursdayFirst the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:"Are you together"Well duh it's 2010  Two wedding bands my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me somewhere in N Africa but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a coupleNext the food was miserableI had an "Orange Peel Beef" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer  Again I ask myself why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in ArizonaMy wife or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed ordered some chicken dishAgain over-breaded had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white riceThis was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch  Literally my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home  Three of three strikes shame on us for giving it another shotPei Wei was awesome about three years ago but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend "food stand-down" and retraining of the chef'sI was HEAVILY disappointed  Again.
I've been to half the Filibertos in Phx since the first one opened While living on the East Coast I yearned for a late night Fili run and would do so whenever visiting I've moved back and been to this location at Gilbert and Baseline and foolishly keep going back Here are my grievances:Prices way upQuality so so (usually just a bean and cheese burrito but cold and for $403)Attitude C'mon It's Filibertos Don't judge me at the counterBottom line is two bean burritos with cheese and a medium drink for $1250 I may as well be in NYC And then the attitude Just don't need it I'll hit Ricardos up the road :)I'll keep hitting Filis here and there but this one is finally gone over the top and lost me They just don't care There are plenty of folks driving thru and their tills are running over Clearly there is no pressing need to maintain a charade of friendly service to mix with their high-priced fast food.
I think this place closed There's a notice on the door that says "Notice of Bankruptcy Chapter 7".
This was a very bizarre land of contradiction It really seemed unclear as to whether this was supposed to be a bar that served food and had bands a restaurant that had douches and band a venue that also had food etc They then told us we could sit at the only table there or not They were still serving food no they weren't yes they were Maybe it was our bad for going for dinner but what was the cover for The alleged entertainment certainly didn't earn it   Food was ok i suppose as long  the other choice was Chef Boyardee The staff was oblivious over loaded and disorganized The whole experience reminded me why I was skeptical to begin with.
pinky's is closed.
Having spent a good chunk of my life in Maui and Oahu I know a thing or two about Hawaiian food and this is not it  This place is an epic failure a chemical warfare assault on your taste buds  I've never had Hawaiian food taste like this or taste this bad in my life  It was like the owner went to a Hawaiian restaurant once and then said "You know what I could make this" and then set out to make everything from their Alzheimer riddled memory banksTypical "plate lunch" style foods should have a main dish served with "two scoop rice 1 scoop mac salad" and this fit that requirement but execution was terrible at best  I tried the bbq ribs which should have been moist sweet and savory and were instead oily and bland served with rice which was Sahara dry and should have been a bit sticky and the mac salad which should have been creamy and slightly sweet and was instead inedible  My partner had similar issues with their over fried Mahi Mahi plate and the strange and random array of sauces that accompanied her dishI'm not sure anyone could convince me to try this place again as I can't imagine wanting to subject myself to this monstrosity.
Stay away from this business  They are dishonest  Do not drop your clothes off here donate them to charity  They can not account for items dropped off and then soldRepeated attempts the resolve the problem have ended in frustration  We will be reporting them to the BBB  Do everyone a favor and go elsewhere.
Cranky old man who has been in the business too long If his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss I would not recommend going to this man.
Tried to eat here on Saturday night  I say "tried" because we never ended up seeing our server  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full  The thing is our server never came  Never  No "hello" no "I'll be with you in a moment" nothing  Very strange since the place was NOT busy  A confused busboy walked by and another waiter walked by but nobody every came to our table  WTF  We left after 10 minutes  So definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored.
I used to love this placebut love is blind I ignored rude and slow servicebut at end of day so many other better options in Old Town Sera Sera.
I did not have a good experience at this restaurant at lunch time  I ordered the Cheese Steak Salad with dressing on the side  The salad came and after a few bites I asked the bus boy to get the waitress  The salad was so full of  grease and I was unable to eat it  The waitress came back and said well what do want  I said just bring me a plain small salad  She brings the salad and still charges for the Cheese Steak Salad  Needless to say I will not returnAlso the new addition is beautiful but how do you expect people to sit and eat a full course meal on benchs  Not very comfortable.
this place is a big joke why do people go there big line lol woowww   Service is slow slowwwww 40min to order drinks and i tip 40% your loss sweetie.
Food was poorly made Pouched eggs thrown on a thin layer of stale sour dough bread with a touch of goat cheese that was very hard to find under wet asparagus and over cooked cheery tomatoes.
I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center  It was not very busy  The staff was friendly and neat I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long.
No alcohol Okay But the pool tables were a little crappy and the pool sticks were way crappy If I was 18-20 this would be my hangout but its not made for people to play pool as you may expect with the word 'Billiards' in the name It really is just a loud place for kids to hang out There is nothing wrong with that but because they cater to a young crowd they don't know pool etiquette they just want to stand in big groups around each other doing not much I quickly bounced out.
What type of bar serves drinks in a thimble you ask  THIS ONE  What a freaking rip off  Sure the waitresses were hot but in Zona apparently all of the girls are hot  Well at least in the 5 mile radius  They must grow because of the sun  They probably use photosynthesis  The atmosphere wasn't too bad but it was your typical bar with typical bar food with typical douchebags  Solid one star for the rip off drink amounts.
I wish I could give this BBQ place a high grade but I can't  Others have commented on the parking the self-serve experience and the general atmosphere These didn't have an impact on me I was there for good BBQ  When I eat out or at home I expect everything that should be hot (hot with fire not spices) to be HOT and everything that should be cold to be COLD  I ordered pork and beef brisket potato salad cowboy beans  The portions were small but adequate as I am not a big eater  Other might find the portions to small  The potato salad was OK sort of boring The pork was barely warm and the brisket was just warm I should have taken it back to be heated up but didn't The meat tasted OK but nothing to get excited about The cowboy beans were hot and this dish was by far the best cowboy beans I've had in a long time  Doubt I'll go back.
The food is amazing The servers are great The hostesses are not informed on what's going on But the reason I'm giving them a 1 star review is because the manager Mils (I believe that was his name and as he informed me he's the ONLY manager they have) is quite possibly the rudest most condescending person ever Dude you're in the industry of CUSTOMER service Learn how to properly interact with people I will NEVER go back based on him solely him I tell everyone I know not go there because of him I have never been treated so poorly after making a reservation for 20 3 weeks in advance and being told upon arrival that they had no table ready because no one had made a reservation when their hostess had called literally an hour and a half before to confirm that we were still coming He was so incredibly rude about it talked down to me telling me I didn't know what I was talking about I was wrong and I must have made up the reservation until I played him the message from the hostess at which point he just walked away The owner stepped in and asked tables to move so they could get our group in We still waited for over 45 minutes UGH I work in the restaurant industry I can NOT imagine treating people this way and expecting them to return SO BAD I would highly suggest improving your customer service skills Mils You're awful.
never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before i won't give a time it happened nor will i ever return so i honestly don't fear retributionbut after waiting 30 minutes between drinks and then never saw the waitress again i was so fed up with this place i just walked the fuck out if they don't care enough about the customers to at least make their rounds every 5-10 minutes to see if we are happy then they certainly don't care about my money which by the way i would have been happy to give them the drinks were good but i was sober before the next one arrived unless they are freezing the ice cubes to order there is no reason for a delay I'm not going to cause a fuss and complain to the manager I'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service so kick rocks I'm outfrom my experience i really don't think this establishment deserves more then 1 star i would give 0 if it was possible.
I ordered 3 items to go one of which was chicken tikka masala and  I didn't get it we were charged for it but we got a beef dish with lots of bones I was pretty disappointed I don't think I will be back.
Lets start off good and work downward shall weI loved the salad bar THE BEST APPLE AND CHICKEN SALAD I ever had  Mozzarella Boccochinis the best asparagus  I have had ever Not crazy about the Prosciutto (no taste very blah) but the smoked salmon superbly sliced and Fabulous Let me not forget what ever was on the table in the pop over bread thing OMG that was a highlight for me Now I like to see my wait staff work hard as I tip off that idea These Guys were on their game quickly as if they were riding a horse they came to the table with swords of meat and sliced accordingly to my desired cook level After sampling every meat  (or most of them) I dawned on me that somehow they all tasted alike   The saturation on herbs and the distinct flavor of lemon smothered each meat   Now I like lemon of lamb and pork but not everything  I did PIG out and I was sorry that I could not afford the 1450 for a glass of wine nor the 850 for a cup of coffee  I love meat and meat loves me but I just can't be that glutenous  Sorry I could not be more support of.
Meh nothing special at all Had the brisket sliders more like fat sliders Save yourself the nausea.
I bought a coupon for this place BEFORE I checked the ratings  Tried it on Friday because there is  "Flamenco" show  At about 7:35PM a guitarist takes his place on a chair and begins to strum  Hmmm  not bad I thought  Then a woman with dancing shoes emerges wearing a frilly nylon pink dress which could have easily been a nightgown  (not trying to be mean just telling the truth)  She did two dances and during the rest of her time she sat down and  clapped along while the guitarist played  When I presented the coupon the waiter told me that I had to order two entrees  Having read from other Yelpers that they had been told the same I quickly corrected the waiter and told him that the coupon said $40 worth of FOOD not necessarily entrees  They acquiesced They served us hot rolls no butter  Instead a garlicky ranch type dressing  I put up with it  cost saving measure I guess  My friend ordered the Chicken Al Jerez a chicken cutlet in sherry sauce  He didn't want rice so he got vegetables  On the menu in the restaurant it doesn't specify that dishes come with soup or salad as it does on the internet  I told the waiter and he added a salad The chicken was overdone but the taste of the sauce was good  Mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can  Salad was fresh  I had two appetizers  Empanadas & Shrimp wrapped in bacon  Empanadas should be meat filled turnovers  Not here  It was made with pizza dough stuffed with tomato sauce and slivers of chicken so small that I had to closely check it to be sure what it was  I set it aside because it was not worth eating  The waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer  Nice guy  Ordered Tortilla Espanola a traditional fritata containing sliced potatoes in its place  It was good  You can't hurt a frittata Just dump stuff in the eggs and you're done  I enjoyed the shrimp and bacon appetizer (I think Trader Joe's sells these frozen)  until I awoke last night with heartburn  I remember eating them and thinking that the bacon was not totally crisped up (needed more time in the oven)  My fault for not telling them  The saving grace of this evening was the server who waited on us and really tried to please us  The one star is for him  The owner who had greeted us initially at the door was busy setting tables with tablecloths (another cost-cutting measure) instead of checking in on his patrons  I for one do not recommend this place to anyone.
Went here for a manicure after previously having a shellac manicure elsewhere  Instead of soaking my nails in remover for 5-10 minutes to take off the old polish the nail technician pried/chiseled the old polish off with a fake nail  It hurt and left my nails brittle until they grew out (over a month)  There are plenty of great nail salons in the area that provide top notch service at an affordable price - don't waste your time here.
In order to have - as their jingle claims - MORE than just great wings don't you first need to HAVE great wings Absolutely awful food terrible service and a gross dirty restaurant And keeping an eye on me my wife and my two little girls to make sure we're not watching some stupid MMA thing otherwise you'll be back to collect your cover charge Man eff all that nonsense Never again Ever.
Please don't waste your time or money Ate here twice years apart and got food poisoning both times Horrible just horrible Save yourself.
if I could give this restaurant zero stars I would  It was that bad  We had gone for my birthday  and it was our first time there  They sat us right by the kitchen after i specifically asked for a nice table The food was inedible  And that is putting it kindly  I even wrote a letter to the owner and manager and never heard back from them  It was like taking $ 150 and burning it in front of me  NEVER AGAIN.
Have been an Ulta customer for a long time but had never tried the salon until recently  Was a HORRIBLE experience  My stylist Delia ran 45 minutes late to start me and on several occasions during the hair cut stopped and kept looking around  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted but shot down the only thing I did ask for  She said I wouldn't look good  At the end of the painful ordeal she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store after which I waited in they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction  (happened twice then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back.
Mulligans I am disappointed in you  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night  However it has gone downhill over the past few months and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again  Let me be specificIf you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apologythen I will not return and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can regardless of how "fun" your bar might beA few months ago I went to Mulligans and when ordering my drink I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card  I ended up ordering one more beer and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night  The next day after checking my bank account I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans  I immediately called them to inform them of the error but was told pretty rudely that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab and that it would just "fall off" in a few days at my banknothing else they could do   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar)  Furiously I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available againA month or so later I went in again  Same situation same low dollar bill same $50 holdalthough this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry) and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt)Flash foward to last week  I went to Mulligans again this time for St Patricks Day  Based on my previous conversation with the manager I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time I would be fine  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars) and closed out  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total $6) and closed out  The next day I checked my accountand found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans for $25 eachI immediately called again and explained the situation  The person on the phone immediately started in on their "policy" to hold funds when there is an open tab   I told him that I had been aware of that  and that is why I closed out each timeSo why I was being "held" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point)  He stated "well  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off there's nothing we can do"  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me and he interrupted to say sarcastically "you really need to take this up with someone elseI'm just the barback"  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone and said (overenthusiastically)   "absolUTELY   I would LOVE to do that for you"  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway and again requested that the manager call me that night  He replied "ABSOLUTELY" again in his rediculous tone and then hung up on me  I never heard from the managerThis is incredibly poor customer service a poor way to handle your customer's money and a really EASY way to lose business  By the way it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held  This is a recession people I go places with cheap beer for a reason  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary)  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness.
I have been to this buffet before and it is usually very good This time it was so bad that I barely ate anything First of all the food did not look appetizing at all It was old and crusty looking The crab legs were dry and unseasoned The place smelled bad and the food area looked dirty My husband took  a few bites of the food my daughter and I took one bite and promptly asked for a refund I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my card credited because the manager was in a meeting I don't think I will ever go back to this place again.
After what I had read I expected this place to be dog friendly  As soon as I opened the door with leash and dog in hand I was pointed out the doorI'm guessing it's because they serve "people food" to  regardless  very disappointed  I will not be back.
Let's see - the last and only other review for this branch was a little over two years ago and was two stars Which for me is too manyWhile at some point I am sure I will write a story with my experiences in sorting out the financial cluster-fuck my mom created and didn't leave a master map for - it will probably need to be marketed as fiction but still quite entertaining as long as it didn't happen to your lifetoday is not that day - so I will skip some of the more sordid details for nowFor Yelp review purposes - FIVE visits to the bank in person dealing face to face with people to continually be given partial information irrelevant information and negligently incorrect informationAll for a halfhearted apology and a bottle of water LovelyHere's the thing Wells - my mother had accounts with you for many years My stepfather has an account with you Had I been treated well had I been treated with any value and respect and even a modicum of interest I may have started an account with you I would have been a relatively easy sell However not only was I not convinced I'd get stellar service if I were your customer I was so disgusted by the horrible communication and mediocre at best service that there's no way I'd ever consider an account with you You effectively drove away my business before you even got it Granted - I am not the Sultan of Brunei or any relation to Bill Gates - the lack of my business won't effect your bottom line in any notable way You'll never feel the pinch of having driven a way a potential small time checking and savings account customer But if you keep it up there may be enough of us that is DOES make a difference Try to remember that.
Furniture shopping is supposed to be fun and after finally being able to afford something that isn't at Walmart or a hand-me-down I was looking forward to itThanks Ashley for making it a painful and stressful process I originally reviewed Yelp and several of the typical AZ chain stores websites (Room Store Mor Ashley etc) Ashley seemed to have the best options (but no pricing) so I went there first Ugh Big mistake First off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture (Um yeah thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes withI need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do hopefully undistributed) It's WORSE than buying a car It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furnitureI did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive Like overpriced expensive I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there However at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements I ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was "the one" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople)Oh and they don't include measurements on the item tagI think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements talking the ENTIRE timeBottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz Mor random other stores had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone).
Stay as far away as you can This was my second visit and my last To have to prepay be acosted and over charged for a job done incorrectly is disturbing in the least A refund/replacement was out of the question for ruining my pants (hem that was not required making my pants too short) unless she got the pants back Who does that Nada is in no way interested in customer satisfaction or retention Beware.
Every time I go there is empty shelves throughout the entire food section no matter when I go have talked to managers so much about this they know me by name now still not stocked as any busy store should be.
NO WAY  Went there in plenty of time of before Groupon expiration date and got a story that they are booked until expiration  They would not honor for the Groupon value after that date even though it was THEIR fault that we couldn't get in  No I will not spend the lesser amount coming back to Salt Cellar  They will get NO money from me  Groupon will refund my payment  Rude rude manager  No desire to eat there.
Bought a group coupon to this location and I wanted to use it today  This location is closed down  Called the Frank Lloyd Wright location and asked whether they would honor the coupon  Was told to call back when the manager arrives @ 5pm and ask him  Hopefully they'll honor it  Have to wait and see.
Its suitable when you are dying for quick cheap pizza I have lived within a block of them ever since they opened I have eaten there three times in like 8 years I try them again about once every two years to see if they have improved Here is the problem: it just doesn't taste that good Owner and employees are nice but the product is average They need to use better cheese and tastier sauce The crust is also average way too chewy/doughy It's funny because if they just fixed their pizza they could really have a good thing - it's totally tucked away in this little corner by the fountain outdoor seating is avail in this tiny little strip mall with like zero competition for a two mile radius - local neighborhood people like me would totally get behind them but the pizza is just not that good sorry.
I would give it zero I don't understand how this can be a brand they dont DO anything their clothes have NO design touch to them at all You can't even count the colors since they do every color so they dont really have to think about that either I'm sorry but 50 bucks for a boring cheap hoodie just isn't worth my time.
What a joke If anyone ever asks me to attend this club again I will kindly show you a sarcastic smile while giving you the middle finger and walk away This place is like a crammed hallway ALL DUDES It seriously is a waste of time You literally have to push yourself through a wall of people that are shoulder to shoulder to get anywhere I am not even sure if the Fire Marshall would be pleased with the occupancy of the place This place smells like Body Oder and Vomit Both make sense giving the fact I seem someone blow chunks in a packed crowd That was really the only entertainment I saw at this place.
The last time will be the last time Yesterday at CF waiter was passable He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer and did not do so until asked Food and drinks were good However at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched Waitress did not initially apologize but stated "It's just a spill" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband shirt wheelchair and wheels We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning then the waitress said she was sorry No comp no apology until we cleaned up ourselves Even worse two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same placeand another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched This was weird deja vu  Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible and they don't know their limit until they exceed it Ha Overall food was good and service was sub par Attitude was LOUSY The customer who is paying about $2500 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy Better luck when seated at the bar on past visits No spillage.
US AIRWAYS - The WORST customer service  Have you also had a horrible experience with this airlineRecently my wife and I flew from Phoenix to Munich via Los Angeles The first leg was (unfortunately) on US Airways through the 'Star Alliance' which is a group of airlines that claim to work together to make the flying experience more enjoyable  We were scheduled to connect to our Lufthansa for the flight to Germanyleg in Los Angeles What we experienced was horrible customer service on US Airways leaving me to question what is the benefitof the Star AllianceThe details: The US Airways agent refused to check our bags from Phoenix to our final destination even though they are in the Star Alliance with Lufthansa which they claim makes it all one big happy family of airlines    When we asked why the US Airways agent wouldn't check our bags through as we had all our boarding passes and were checked in for all our flights he decided to (we find out later) lie and say that 5 days prior US Airways changed its policies to no longer allow luggage to be checked to a final destination if you are connecting as part of your trip It had never been this way based on the benefits of the Star Alliance and we make this trip every year so were very put off by his lack of help The result - my wife had to sprint and catch a shuttle in the very busy Los Angeles airport to get to the international terminal begging Lufthansa to wait for her sweating husband who had to wait (and wait) to pick up our bags in baggage claim and bring them to the Lufthansa ticket counter to be rechecked for the long flight Unfortunately the US Airways flight left Phoenix 1  1/2 hours late dwindling our connection time concerning us that our bags would not make it on the flight to MunichThankfully the ticket agent at the Lufthansa counter was amazing claiming it was not a problem to get our bags on the plane even with such a short amount of time before takeoff (he even had an additional agent waiting to take our bags if need be) but informed us that the US Airways ticket agent had told us wrong information  He said the "new regulation" the US Airways agent referred to does not exist especially since we had our boarding passes from Los Angeles to Munich already printed  Basically the US Airways agent had lied to us and refused to helpWhat matters here is that US Airways has a complete disregard for customer service has no issue taking money for an expensive ticket yet lacks any desire to deliver customer service or provide the services they claim they provide to their customers My wife and are were so frustrated and so put off by the lack of help to get us checked through to our final destination that I had to share this story  Don't believe everything you are told by these airlines and DEMAND better service    We will be looking for a different airline option next time we fly - choosing not to fly on US Airways based on this experience.

A bunch of Co workers and I went here for lunch thinking of breaking the normal lunch time routine  Well the experience was terrible to say the least  Our waitress lost our simple order and came back to us a half hour after she took our initial order to admit it  Things happen Its understandable  But another half hour goes by with  no signs of our food or even a heads up when it might be coming out Now we are late coming back from our lunch break and we just wanted to pay for our drinks and go We felt as it was forced upon us to stay and did not feel like it was right  So long story short She did not give us any discount on her mistake  they gave us to go boxes  Messed up everyone's order in the to go box  and each paid 13 dollars for a lunch that tasted so un-cooked that half of us ended up throwing it away If you do go here  Just make sure you have plenty of time to hang out.
I had finn this please a couple times when I was driving down tatum boulevard so I thought that I would give it a try 25 min wait for a sandwich on a thursday nightand the food is average at best :(.
Mediocre meal at best  Very poor service  Decor and feeling is nothing special  Would they benefit from some gender diversity in their staff.
ok i'm done done i tell you i cannot get a consistent haircut from these folks my hair is simple Number 3 on the sides trimmed on the top kinda "boxy" style and not a uniform buzz cut I only have one cowlick at the crown of my noggin these past 3 times i tell the lady my simple hair cut i have had to return later in the day or the next day to get all the straggler hairs the uneveness and basically my whole head re-cut and they don't even get that right they just run the clippers over it to even it out and i leave with a standard buzz cut but this last chance was the last straw the same lady whom i dreaded seeing when i walked in and she said "come on back" was free and thus was going to cut my hair she spent an inordinate amount of time cutting my hair using all types of fancy scissors and giant plastic pitchfork looking things but mostly spent the 45 minutes talking and reallynot focusing on cutting my hair when she was finished i immediately noticed again how she did not even bother to trim my cowlick when i pointed it out to her she says "i'm not finished i just wanted you to see how it looks so far"Malarky she then got out the clippers and basically gave me a very very very uneven buzz cut andthe past 3 cuts from her i still have all the scraggly hairs above and behind my ears that i just trim when i get homesince i left with it so short i would have been pointless to get it correctedthat would just entail me shaving my head myself so i'm going to listen to my wife and go to a barber or pay a little more at a salon or just go shaggy i know it's only 15 bucks but my hair is not that complicated and i guess i just expected a decent haircut every once in a while but 3 in a rowthe fool is me.
I have been a member of Restaurant Depot for about 6 months now and I find the customer service to be horrible They are constantly out of stock on many items and the employees walk around with no sense of urgency as if they are doing you a favor by being there If by some stroke of luck you happen to find one of their employees shuffling around the store and you ask them a question don't expect an educated answer just expect a glazed over look as if you were speaking in a foreign language and expect the answer to be "I'm not sure" or "I don't know" I have literally asked when an item would be back in stock and have gotten the answer "it could be any time there is no way of knowing" as if every time they get a delivery it is a surprise Once you are finally done crusading through the gauntlet of disappointment be prepared to stand in line for at least 20 minutes even if you only have 2 items as they have no organization or concern as to their speed of service After all business owners have all the time in the world and are never pressed for time yes that was sarcasm Once it is finally your turn to be checked out keep your fingers crossed that your cashier doesn't leave mid check out and yes this has happened to me several times In closing I have rarely ever left Restaurant Depot with out being more stressed out more annoyed and out of time If I had any other Restaurant Supply options in the area I would be spending my money there already.
Food was good but service was slow Did not get waters until we were seated for 15 mins Had to track down our server just to get orders in It was not busy so not sure what the issue was To top it off there were flies Fortunately my girls thought it was funny when I swatted one If yelp support typed pictures I would post it as evidence.
I am so disappointedWent there early this evening for a celebratory dinner We walk in and it smells well old The atmosphere is cold and the place is kind of in disrepair They need to just redo the interior designOur server while pleasent did not seem to do the normal things one would expect at a wine barno mention of happy hour specials no mention of wine flights no explanations about the winesit was weird I had to practically interrogate him for information The wine itselfmeh We sampled 6 in a flight and ordered 2 additional glassesThere were a few I did enjoy like the summer peach and the chocolate divine But I think a normal wine drinker would find their wines way (way) too sweet and overall mediocreThe food Now this just makes me mad I ordered the bruschetta sampler and the only one I even half way enjoyed was the blue cheese/grape And while I thought the flavor was good the execution was sloppy I don't like to eat a meal that is not presented nicelyThe grilled shrimp one was NOT grilled or seasoned It was cold and rubbery Like it had been microwaved and left to sit And it was coupled with a bland nasty hummas Ick I spit it into my napkin AwfulThe prosciutto and fig normally one of my favorite combinations was not good They put a bitter lettuce on top which I don't understand and an overpowering sickly sweet sauce It did not work well together at all Crabcake was ok But $7 for a tiny little portion was irritating Look I get that it's tapas but come on it was a bite and a half My husband got the rosemary meatballs which #1 were microwaved for sure #2 drowning in marinara sauce which hid all the flavorThey need a new chef.
Went in at about 30 minutes before they closed with my friend Most workers already seemed checked out already and not paying much attention They almost seemed annoyed we were thereWe had a simple order that they seemed very confused about and unsure how to execute They then told me they were out of the soup i wanted so i asked for a different one Then after waiting for another minute or two a manager comes out to inform me that they were out of the second soup as well This wasnt a problem they just took forever to inform me of an easily solvable problem Then After being rang up they had forgotten to give us our breadbowl and an order of mac and cheese Overall it was a really unnecessary ordeal.
I had one hour for lunch and had heard this was one of the best places in town I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here even though lunch is hi-priced The weather was cold so I wanted soup I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food The soup was not sizzling and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup BURNT BLACK I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office so I could not return my meal I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly Maybe this place had a good rep in the past but I will never go back there.
I have been a patient of Dr Lieber for over a year and I would not recommend him or his office to anyone  Making appointments are the only thing that is easy to do  His bed side manner is gruff and I felt like he just wanted me out of there  One time he asked me if I wanted my medicine dose increased  I said I don't know what do you suggest  He asked what I thought   Getting scripts filled and talking to anyone takes at least 1 to 2 days  I was without several medications for 5 days and an other for 2 weeks while we waited for blood work even though I had been on  medicine for 9 years  The assistant told me 3 different times she would call me and never did  I had to call her each time and wait 1 to 2 days for a call back  I'm currently waiting 2 weeks for another medicine that was to be called in and I just found out it hasn't been  I've been without this medicine for a week  I won't get a call back until tomorrow at the earliest because his assistant won't talk to you the same day  Last time I had to go into the office asking for my scripts because I wasn't getting a call back and the scripts weren't called in  The Dr was off when I went in and the lady Dr he shares an office with wouldn't fill my scripts  I had to go to my cardiologist to get them filled even though I had been trying for the 2 weeks to get Lieber to fill them   Once I get this last script filled I'm going to another Dr  I have never had this type of relationship with a Dr before in my life  If I could have given him and his staff 0 stars I would have.
A group of us stopped in here on a Friday night because we had heard it was finally open and wanted to see what it was all about We all love retro type places and things so the idea of a new tiki bar was kind of exciting Alasit just wasn't a very good experience even though our server was trying really hard to make it right I would give him personally 5 stars for that But it was just boring I wanted it to be different I guess I know that the owners have worked really hard and I can appreciate that very much A lot of time and thought went into the decor and it shows if you like the watered down idea of tiki (I liked the artwork) There was just nosoul When I think of tiki I see over the top It just seemed like another bland contemporary place to drink Maybe if I was a young hipster I would have enjoyed it better I asked for a daiquiri but they apparently don't do blended drinks At a TIKI bar they don't I was amazed Then they couldn't get my other drink choice right so the bartender sent a mystery drink over but didn't tell me or the server what it was I didn't like it and I didn't really appreciate just being thrown something randomly I always carry the recipe for my drink with me and even with that the bartender couldn't get it right Also the water we were served tasted terrible and had floaty things in it I have very specific taste and I do know this but I was really hoping for something better None of us wanted to come back.
Had a Reuben Not a Reuben Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut Very little thousand island dressing Marble bread not a strong rye flavor Corned beef was bland too Very very bland I'm from Omaha NE born and raised where the Reuben was invented I'm also Irish This is more of what's called a Rachel Reuben except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey A Reuben should have a sour and tang stink a bit Disappointed Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me.
Okay food terrible slow and arrogant service  You guys need to change your attitude  The server could have cared less about her service ignored us and the food took forever Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long Also we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around We also had to chase our check down as well.
Food-Great  Beer-Great  Service-Absolutely Terrible  Ryan M was our server and everything was a challenge drink refills happened finally as checks came along took 15 minutes to get credit card processed and never even offered desert  It is a shame that such a good restaurant had such terrible service.
THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLEWhile the food is good the service is just not worth it  My coworkers and I ordered lunch from them  We spent over $100 dollars and were promised a delivery time of 11:45 AM to Noon  WE got our order delivered at 12:40 PM I spoke to George who promised he would do something for my coworkers and I yet when I called him the NEXT day he said his DAD "is a Greek who has earned every single dollar he has worked for and that he could not do anything for us"However George did offer to buy me lunch  An hour later for one lunch just isn't worth it  I wasn't expecting anything free however a small discount or even out tip back would have made things better  I am SORRY that they don't know how to handle good customer service They have lost very good clients.
I've been seeing Dr Reddy and Marie Perkins since 2005  Here's how it always goes:  Schedule an appt with the doctor but find out when you arrive that they actually have you seeing the Physicians Assistant Marie Perkins even though you specifically requested Dr Reddy and made the appointment to see her well in advance Wait well over an hour in waiting room Then have Marie be curt and rude w/you while NOT listening to anything you have to share Then she will order your meds for Formulary after you told her generic is what you're insurance will coverAs for the office staffIf you get VERY abnormal lab results the assistant will leave you a msg to call back ASAP but then won't return your call for several days while you wait I have been seeing Dr Reddy and Marie for over 8 years and nothing ever changes I want to find a new endo but there are no others that I can find in Chandler I have seen numerous patients walk out of the office waiting room swearing never to return after they've gotten completely fed up I will need to succumb to finding a new doctor and make the drive to Scottsdale or downtown At least the office wait won't run over 2 hours like it does routinely at Endocrinology Associates.
It's very sad to see  company turn to bad business after the loss of an owner but this one did  I'm very unhappy with the way this company has treated me over a rent a charge  Scottsdale Collision is not paying thier bill's so be very careful when doing business with the company  I was just hit with a charge from Hertz along with a number of other people  This company put me in a rent a car saying the charge was covered by them as my car was being repaired and I was charged for the rent a car one year later  After months of phone call's to Scottsdale Auto Collision I got the run around  I'm now stuck paying this charge because of poor management after the owner was killed or in Jail  The story keeps changing from the company  So Don't hand over your CC unless you want to pay  I was charged one year following my service  What a nightmare this has been~.
I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant We never had a server come to our table Waited 15 mins and nothing We did get chips which were from a bag and not fresh The salsa was also not very stellar We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back.
So bad  Service is always so slow inside  It's like they only care about the drive through and they usually screw that up too I know it's Wendy's so my expectations aren't high but this place still manages to consistently disappoint  Seems like poor managers  Once I had a really nice cashier that was trying hard and even asked for help from other employees when she got backed up but she was told to stop complaining and just go slower  I looked around and saw two other employees flirting with a group of teenagers pretending to clean tables  I could go on with more stories like this but the general trend is slooow bad service with managers who are mean and don't care about customers.
What are you in the mood for  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mindPros:  All you can eatCons:  Why in the world would you want more than a biteEvery different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh the romaine was not the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting the bacon bits contained no trace of pig and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found  While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos package might be worth $7 and change this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein  When your name contains the word "salad" don't you think you should offer some good greens.
I've ordered from this place before and I remember it being "not bad" definitely a lot cheaper than the place closer to the house  Ordered for delivery - Arrived right around the time-frame they gave me  Got the fried wontons sweet & sour chicken and the broccoli with pork  Fried wontons were dry/hard essentially flavourless and just tough to eat  Sweet and sour chicken (sauce on side) was basically a bucket of fried chicken chunks with the plain red sauce in a tub of its own  The chicken itself wasn't terrible but it wasn't particularly good either  Most places I've gotten this from serve it with pineapple and vegetable chunks in the sauce So this was just a bit bland and boring for me  The broccoli with pork was OK I can't complain really as I didn't have much of it  The thing that is actually making me write this review was the white rice that came with it I had a bit of it with the sweet and sour chicken no problem then when I went to dump a bit more out I noticed a big long black hair coming out with the rice  Nice  Well that was all for that meal  Oh I did have a fortune cookie as well it said "photographic memory just don't have film"  Thanks   So I'd give it 2 stars for delivery time and value but the hair thing was pretty gross and nothing else was very good  Sorry 1 star.
Buzz kill  It was 3p and there was only 4 varieties all of which were basic and underwhelming  Thinking they were closing soon I asked what their hours where  After commenting on the sparse assortment and finding out there is no cooking on site the clerk said "there might be more coming from another store"  I also inquired about the ingredients wanting to know more about the quality of ingredients used  The gal replied with "she didn't' know" since she didn't cook them  Give me a break  Product knowledge especially when it comes to food is standard  Most bakeries are known for something using organic ingredients having a signature cake ect  I ended up with chocolate  At 350 a pop it had way too much frosting  cake was dry could be compared to a Safeway bakery cupcake just more presentable  I'll take a sprinkles cupcake any day where at least you know your getting top of the line ingredients and almost always have a great selection of flavors.
My friend and I went late Saturday morning for omelets Mine was a huge disappointment It was obvious that it had been sitting under a heat lamp They tossed in chopped bacon folded heated and served It was more of a very dry egg taco My friend said his omelet was okay I will say that the coffee was good and the server was friendly It wasn't worth the 20 minute wait outside in the heat we won't be returning.
My experience with Molina Bridal was about three years ago  I didn't do yelp then or you better believe I would have put this comment then  I'm looking for dresses again and saw Molina on here so thought I should warn those considering this placeAt first our experience was great  Heck it was amazing  We had gone to other places and looked at dresses for my nieces quinceanera and they just couldn't do what we wanted  Then we went to Molina  The staff was so nice and helpful and painted a beautiful picture  We selected dresses for the girls - 14 of them from one of the books they had  They we simple black dresses but we wanted to add some pink to it so decided on a pink strap that would be sewn in around the waist about two inches thick  When the dresses came in we all went for a fitting only one of the dresses had the strap and it was only pinned on so we could see  We were fine with that and actually glad because the strap was not even  Where the strap was to meet in the back on either side of the zipper you could clearly see that the strap wasn't evenly cut  One side was about 1/4 in thinner  They assured us this was just a fast cut done so we could see the look but that everything would be done perfect  A couple weeks before the quinceanera the dresses weren't done yet  The girls weren't able to pick them up until the week of  The girls started picking up the dresses on Wednesday for a Saturday event  On Friday we had our final rehearsal and I had all the girls bring there dresses so they could try them on and we could see how they looked in them  We were so excited to see them in there dresses  Then that excitement turned to horror when the girls started coming out in there dresses  The satin straps that they had sewn on were horrible  On some you could see the yarn that's how poorly and loose the strap was sewn in  The majority of the others were like the strap was at the fitting  Where the strap meet in the back I had two dresses extremely off  One side was the 2 inches it should have been and the other closer to 1 inch  No way did the seamstress not notice how off that was they just didn't careI immediately called them and they were extremely rude and laughed yes they even laughed  I told them I would be there in the morning and that someone better fix at minimum the two dresses that were so horribly off  They flat out told me know and that they would call the police if I went  Now I was mad when I called them because they were extremely rude but to refuse to fix the dresses and threaten to call the police  That is crazy  The morning of the quince I drove with the two girls and their dresses to Molina's and when they saw me pull up they locked the doors  They just looked at me and smirked  That didn't go to well for them as a few other cars pulled at the same time as me all potentially new customers so I proceeded to tell them my story and show them the dresses One of the girls at Molina's came out and told the others they could enter they all got back into their cars and left  I ended up taking the dresses to Ofelias Bridal all the way across town  I remind you this is the day of the event  I went spoke to Ofelia directly and she was amazing  I had dealt with her 10 years prior for my own quince and kicked my self for not going to her in the first place  Ofelia took the dresses and told me to come back in an hour  We left and got our makeup done and came back for the dresses  They were perfect  She even fixed a few other mistakes on the dresses that I hadn't even asked but she noticed when she had the girls try the dresses on when we first went  We made it back home to finish getting ready and in the end those two dresses were the best ones  I'm sure not all experiences will be like ours but I definitely wouldn't chance it ever again.
The couple their was very kind unfortunately that does not make up for expired products including perishables that abound in this store (Check out the cheese while you wait)The olive oil on my hummus was rancid If someone was raised on Mediterranean food and feels that this place  is excellent It means you were raised on rancid food and have become accustomed to it.
Food sucks service sucks and the atmosphere sucks  Wish yelp allowed negative stars.
Shocker this place closed  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors.
happy hour menu read rolling rock and coors light for X dollars  i ordered one and got less change than expected  bartendar says the prices need to be updated  chump change but i felt bamboozled.
What a lousy experience  I went in to get a hair cut  They don't take appointments but you can put your name on a list  The bad thing is that if you're sitting there waiting the people on the list can come back ANYTIME they want and get in front of those who have been waiting  I expressed my dissatisfaction about that and one of the stylists (Grace) thought it was funny  Nice  Suffice it to say I won't be going back here.
Stupidest layout of 4 measly broken down pumps.
I had to remove my other review because first impressions can be wrongAWEFUL Went with my parents and the rude young girl taking the order messed every burger up Went up to complain and nobody would listen they kept their heads down and never made eye contact with meSo I came home and wrote a letter I gave them a week to get back to me and still no reply Don't go if you want your order screwed up and you actually want to enjoy your dinnerWe won't be going back to the Habit ever again.
I no likeI thought the atmosphere was awful  Too bright and hospital like for my tastesI thought the staff was incredibly snotty inept and downright rudeI thought the wine selection left a lot to be desiredIt was cheap because it was happy hour  We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section and were rather commercial and blahIt also came with sliced pepperoni  Pepperoni  ReallyI just didn't like itWhich is truly a shame because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple   But alas I'll keep searching.
very sad this store went out of business.
The customer service here was absolutely horrendous I was in a party of 6 and was told it would be 30-40 minutes to be seated After checking back in with the hostess 4 or 5 times it ended up taking over 2 hours to be seated Apparently the hostess was unaware that even though the 6-person tables were occupied 6 people could be seated by placing together any of the unused 4 person tables with any of the unused 2-person tables By the time we were seated half the restaurant was empty but there was a large contingent of angry people still waiting to be seated Additionally the waitress was terrible offered nothing to compensate for the long wait screwed up our order and argued with someone at our table regarding what she ordered The food was good but I'll never go back.
REI you had such a good thing goingwhy oh whySometimes an event lives great because it offers so much more than it intends When it's a store putting it on for the sake of it's customers (and I'd like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a saleWe have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals) A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning waitBut it was the people that made it We'd hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails lakes and camping sitesand then with nervous excitement we'd charge into the parking lot like mad men snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar thanking the REI gods that we the chosen few the members would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of pricesFlash forward to yesterdayI evidently missed the memo that the "new and improved" garage sale was happening in the store up in the clinic room Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot J with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year J got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions Several minutes later he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were calledI was dubiousthe line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren't looking any happier than if it was 98º with screaming kids at said park Long story shortit was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse Once there we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shopwe picked up a few things set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handedREI management this is an epic fail in my opinion You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly aboutand worse yet you didn't even make the sale that we intendedyou didn't sell the $53 bike seat you didn't sell the $1795 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 yearsSometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin Sometimes it's a way to show your customers the loyalty they've shown you we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a yearis that too much to ask from a store that we've been loyal too for half our lives.
Went to Cadillac Ranch for the first time last night with a big group of friends (about 12 of us) for a birthday get-together We got there around 8pm and started ordering drinks and food The waitress was attentive so that's a plus but the food and drinks were not very good and they were very overpriced I ordered the nachos and what do they bring me A plate of small tostadas WTF Also they burnt the chicken they put on top of these tostadas Every bite was 50/50 between dry bland food and gross burnt flavor So then I ordered chicken strips and fries While the fries were pretty good the chicken was very bland and kind of chewy Now for the drinks the birthday girl had quite a few and I tried a bit of each Most of them were really tart and honestly hard to drink I had the big blue punch-bowl drink with the Red Bull in it and while it was a decent (3-star) drink there's no way in hell it's worth $14 Up until 10pm this place is a solid 2 stars However after 10pm they brought out a terrible DJ and cranked the music up so loud we couldn't hear each other anymore The music was terrible way too loud and it totally ruined the conversation we were all having Around this time about half of our group left The only reason we stayed is because a few people were still on their way so we tried to make the best of it and we stayed until 11:30pmThe comments from just about everyone in our 12 person group were "Wow this place isn't very good is it" or "Where did our waitress go After 10pm they simply abandoned us over here didn't they"All in all great company at our table but this place sucks.
Me: Do you have Sierra Nevada  Bartender: No Gone before I can request an alternative  Angry service and moderately busy  Don't go hereUpdate - looks like they had a change in beer selection and service since my original review  May revise after a few more visits  They actually carry more than the domestics now  I had a Guinness last visit.
I reviewed my bank statement online today and found out they had charged me twice for bad food I strongly recommend that you skip this restaurant all together Management is unresponsive to customer concerns.
This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside  OMG hoarder heavenThe food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table  I actually liked the hamburger  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was thatIt appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce.
Went in on 12/23 to shop for foundation from Clinique - was high jacked by Smashbox - spent 22413 sadly while processing it the system showed it failed so they ran it again as a credit card - ultimately charging me twices for the same purchase Nordstroms denied processing it twice yet - there it wasmy bank finally removed the charge only to have Nordstroms push the charge through 5 days later - AGAIN I knew this had to be an issue so took it to another level the regional manager - what a waste of time - she can not call me back and sends the Manager at Nordstroms who denied all of this call me instead Now I finally get a call back to inform me that this happened to SEVERAL people and now I am facing 5 NSF fees from my bank - because of them and they want me to give them ANOTHER 5 days to process this.
do not use this storage facility   have you ever heard of hidden fees  well if you havent experienced hidden fees before this is the place to go they might price match but soon after you will get a notice in the mail saying you owe a lot more then you expected and on top of that you get a nice big late fee because they dont send you a bill  no email no letter the only bill you get is a jacked up late notice   the managers are not friendly and not willing to work with you sorry guys but a big upset.
This office is a joke  I scheduled an appointment was given a price after verifying my insurance and then when I was seen (a 7 min apt) I was charged 3x the price I was initially quoted with no reason why  They were rude and uncaring and I will never go back There are too many doctors in this area to be treated with such disregard.
Taste like trashy Unbelieve when I ate tamales and found excessive salt not fresh and oily I refuse to come to this lousy restaurant again.
This place is closed and therefore crushed my soul RIP Cinnabon I looked all over for this place only to find that it was permanently closed :(.
Have been looking for a good handyman for sometime and unfortunately I'll have to keep looking We needed three new sinks installed and Mr Fix it was not happy that there were other trades working in the house mad that he'd have to get some supplies and unwilling to work past four Besides he was rude to my girlfriend I fired them and am getting someone else.
They STEAL  The worst hotel everIIt hurts me a lot to give them a starOne of my friend came from China to visit mea few weeks ago He checked  in on Mar 7 And we went to a NBA game Phoenix Suns VS Huston Rockets His biggest American dream come true He had a wonderful trip in the US until on Mar 11 He left his room around 8:30 am and I took him back to his hotel at 3:00pm he found out his $900000 camera was gone Also the charger was in the side pocket of his backpack which was at least a yard a way from the camera was goneThe people who took the camera apparently searched his room We call the general manager immediately he came listened then told us that he's be back with us very soon After 4 hours of waiting we went into his office he told us that the technician told us that only 2 people entered the room one my friend the other the housekeeper DUH He told us he needed 12-15 hours for an answer but he didn't By the time we checked out on march 14th that was the last time we saw the general manager his name is Angel He told us that everything was out of his hand We had to complain to the Holiday Inn Corp Guest Relationship They told us someone would contact us no more than 2 days 2 weeks later I have to complain again because no one contacted me Now its been more than 3 weeks STILL no contact Now it's time for people to know what happened In HOLIDAY INN THEY STEAL PLEASE DO NOT stay here if you have a choice If you have no choice KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
Look out  The nice girls on the phone are a cover for the worst billing nightmares which will plague you  They randomly charge you and say 'oh well' it was a mistake  In the meantime bounced check charges are not covered Also they left a not-cool box on the drive after I moved and the next people could not move into the house as the driveway was blocked  I lost my deposit for not returning the property in a timely fashion  They never returned my call re:  why they 'forgot' to pick up the pod  Stay away  No one can be this bad  You will lose money with them  One star is too much.
The food is over priced and mediocre No prices are noted on specials board We spent over 100 dollars on a meal Saturday night at another restaurant  that beat this 100 dollar one hands down The aioli starter with bread tasted like pureed tuna salad instead of an aioli The scallop dish was bland The scallops could have stood more of a sear and the fettucine should have been dressed with a blended cream and lemon instead of the heavy alfredo used on the dish Dessert was tiramisu and yes  it was bland too No taste of marsala or any other liquer soaking the cake of the tiramisu Over all this was a waste of an effort to have a good meal at a new place for us.
Dominique the pharmacist is completely rude She cut me off as I was talking she had short clipped fast answers completely not understandable when speaking I had a question about a prescription that she rudely asked if it was a "yes" or "no" answer She clearly does not to need work in an environment that patients will have questions because she has no patience or manners I hope she has had better days because she will not get anywhere with that tone of voice or attitude towards patrons.
So I returned Wow this winter menu sucks I will not go backTechnical difficulties When I was finished all systems were down and I had to wait to pay It would have been nice if my waiter had told me this during the half hour I sat there agitated and kept asking for the check Before finally manually taking my credit card infoBUT MY HUGEST GRIPE:I had the Farro Risotto (Foraged Winter Mushrooms Stracchino Cheese Green Garlic $16 + Wild Shrimp add on for $5 more) It tasted like how can I accurately describe thisYou know how after you're sick to your stomach and you vomit you get *that* breath You can taste it smell it and it makes you cringe It's vomit breathWell my risotto TASTED like what vomit breath SMELLS like It was pretty much VOMIT BREATH OATMEAL with four delicious tiny shrimp whose taste was miraculously unmarred by the vomit concoction that was my anniversary dinnerHonestly I ate bread to fill myself up I didn't want to send back my food (though I did complain about it but my waiter didn't really even notice anyways) I took over half of my meal home to feed to my roommates as a cruel prank since they were jealous they couldn't go with us to eat at Caffe Boa imagine it "Yeah it was awesome I brought some leftovers home you want some"One of them actually vomited The other dry heaved for half an hour and lost his appetite And all of my leftovers (minus those two bites) are stinking up my fridgeYeah the roommate torture part was hilarious (they now hate me ha ha ha ha) but Caffe Boa lost a loyal customerActually 4 after you count my roommates boyfriend and myselfAnd there's still enough Risotto left in the fridge to taint at least a dozen more people against the placeThis was Caffe Boa's last chance after my last visit there and it was an epic fail Someday a year or two from now I MAY consider going back but I really doubt itI'll miss it a bit some of the food was amazing But I don't give a place third and fourth chances no matter how good it is on occasion.
this place is awfulout of the 4 chefs NONE of them were THAI strangely enough all the waitresses were Thaihad the spicy thai eggplant and papaya saladthai papaya salad is supposed to be very tart with a strong taste of limei think they forgot this key ingredient not even a hint of lime flavor although the green papaya was chopped nicelythai eggplant was ridonkulously BAD  i had 3 measly pieces of eggplant in my dish  the rest was overcooked meat and overcooked veggies  overcooked broccoli is the worst kind of loses it's nice green color and firm texturethe sauce for the thai eggplant wasn't quite right either and reminded me of the entree "beef broccoli" from a Chinese restaurantagain this place was BAD phuck phoenix dude i'm over it.
Horrible choice Unfortunate service hostility from staff after confirmed arrangements for a pick-up of car and a loss of property We stayed here on our wedding night for the convenience and seemingly chic accommodations-- would never recommend staying here Issued police report for theft and multiple letters against their service.
I agree with Ricky C  was in Albertson's yesterday and also last week Pork was $349/lb not on sale today it was buy one get one free but the price was $699/lb now how is that buy one get one free  No store in the valley charges $699 for pork.
OK this is not a food review let's start with the good Great space beautiful modern industrial space good outdoor space Well that ends the good So on a Sunday before a spring training game I showed up hoping for a fun brunch before some work After checking in and requesting the "rare" and unavailable breakfast menu we were seated on the upstairs patioand then the wait began Andwe waitedand waitedand wait that table over there apparently has a server Oh apparently he isn't our server OK well the table behind us complained So that table got a "well I'm not your server but I am helping out"  So20 minutes in hmmm maybe this place can't plan for the reality pre-game Giant's game or maybe they think this is Suede or some other "club" where people come in despite the horrendous lack of attention to detail and servicebut hey we can wait a few minutes longerbut should we need to wait 20 minutes OK let's go to the bar WHOA All the waiters are hanging out around the computer entry system"Umm dude what's the code for water" Ummm hey there are 6 of you here how about serving some tables I'm no expert just a suggestion Let's leave SoI can't speak to the food but a good source tells me it matches the service Disappointing at best Please don't waste that building  Either get your act together or hand over the space  Scottsdale is full of wannabesit doesn't need another.
Horrible service both trash cans were over flowing with garbage on the floor everywhere The stocking areas were a disaster and no one was bothering to clean anything even though there were no other costumers to attend to before and after our visit Pure laziness Both of us who ate there got sick and are still recovering 16 hours later I will never eat at that location again and probably never at another Burger King restaurant.
The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar) compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations Big disappointment This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town I had the white sands chimi which has always been good but there was no pork to the chili Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the "yucky tortilla and spicy beans" we were out.
This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I haveI have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it  It took over a half hour to get our food  We sat there and waited and waited  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes  When my food arrived it was cold  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either  The cheese wasn't even remotely meltedOur waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes  We said no  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card  By this time I was irritated  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good.
Slow service staff needs more training There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i don't think this place is going to make it Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service.
The respect from the workers there was flat garbage I got a text saying you can get a buy one get one free smoothie I go in there and ask them about the buy one get one free and the cashier denies it exists I have the text and it came from Jamba Juice He had NO respect towards me Later he completely ignored me I used to come to this Jamba Juice a lot and now I'm not If they get nicer staff that have better attitudes then I will consider coming back But until then i will never come back If I can give this place a negative 10000000 stars I would Customers would be happier if Jamba Juice on Thunderbird Road got new staff This is pitiful.
Disgusting Grilled Fish taco looked like cat food and didn't taste any better  Took 2 bites and threw away.
What a disappointment Shows how ya can't rely on reviews all the time The meat pie was pretty tasty but not worth the 20min wait for it The beef soup in the app menu was SUPER salty and the meat was Tough Yuck Along with the dumplings not being fully cooked My mom ordered the Jerk chicken good tasting but not worth the price Super skinny small breast Of chicken served over an abundance of rice talk about Making your money off rice The service wasn't that great eitherHe was nice but after getting a couple other tables he was swampedI would never recommend this place and the bathrooms are Disgustingly dirty .
I had a really scathing review of this place and the owner emailed me and asked me to take it down so I am  But I have to say I think the food here is dull and tasteless  I would never go back  One of my critical remarks about the food in this valley is that many places are dumbed down without heat or flavor  So maybe this place is just fine for those people who prefer that type of food.
Don't ever eat here We walked in Saturday morning There were about 10 tables open on the patio We told hostess we wanted to sit outside and she said 15 minutes  Why I have no idea except she was trying to load up her friends section instead of seating open tables  Told her to piss off and we went to IHOP across the street Sat immediately and awesome food.
This is going to be brutal  Hide the childrenIf you've been to Chipotle you'll feel right at home at Qdoba That is until you start eating Complete and utter ripoff of the concept except for the part that matters - the execution  Where Chipotle succeeds Qdoba fails miserably  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier  The burritos are just plain bad  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the "other" place  On top of that the rice and beans were the suck  And if you know Brak you know that he LOVES his beans  But not these  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crapIf you want to know the root cause of this debacle check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®  Pretty much explains it allAvoid at all costs  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.
Walked in the door my phone reading 856p and we were turned away stating they were closed Really Sign said they serving at 9p  Other tables with menus in hand and they were willing to let us walk We will never be back  As I write this review my car reads 858p Poor customer service in full display.
The only good thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good Cold food no flavor and crappy service.
it is ok it is pretty much the only place around here where you can have pupusas my biggest complain is that i went to their website and try to use their coupons but when i called to verify my order they told me that the prices changed how about change your website with the new higher prices and stop the false advertisement .
No wi-fi and the manager doesn't know the password to access it If you need a spot with wireless Internet this is not the place.
You know I have been here before and the sushi was good BUT EVERYTIME I ORDER TAKEOUT MY FOOD IS RIDICULOUSLY HORRIBLEThe first time I ordered takeout it was okay Nothing to go nuts about The second time my California roll literally tasted like soap and it was warm Yuck I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order once more (only because Stingray sucks and RA has terrible service)okay my rice was soo sticky on the rolls that I choked on itlike they put superglue on my rice and it didn't finish drying and my spicy tuna was literally dark brown Totally unacceptableC'mon PearlI thought you were better than that.
Very nice hotel the staff was very friendly when we arrived the lady at the desk was helpful the pool was nice and had an excellent view had dinner on the patio it was great Then next day after checking out we thought we would try breakfast sat down after about 5 minutes we were greeted the server brought our drinks and we ordered  Food came out presentation looked great Looked down to find a hair in my food Gross yep this happens that wasn't really a big issue i'm n the same business i understand it happens Sent the food back server comes back insinuates that i made up there was a hair in my food WTF really great customer service you really think i'm gonna spend my birthday weekend at some hotel and then "say there is a hair in my food and make it up" Very Very Very poor customer service not the way to handle the situation asks me what color it was REALLY YOUR AN IDIOT you never ask a guest a stupid question like that to try to argue about something with a guest Then the server comes back to tell us that breakfast actually closed at 11 and he couldnt get hash browns so he was going to give me something else Really Breakfast closes at 12 called the front desk so thanks for the horrible service the hair in my food arguing with me about the hair and then lieing about the time breakfast closed at  and giving me a different side without even asking You definitely did not deserve the tip you got  I should have complained to a manager No manager came out to assure the next plate was OK or to apologize one meal was comped i was completely dissatisfied with the experience of the server must have been brand new also his beard looked tacky TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE would never ever suggest this place again again Restaurant experience 10 years customer service plus THIS GUY WAS HORRIBLE.
Absolutely terrible I would give this place 0 stars if I could I was with a group of 6 other people and none of us enjoyed our meal The chips and salsa (a staple at any Mexican food restaurant) was a far cry from pretty much any other restaurant in the valley (Mexican and otherwise) As for the cost I would put these entrees (and lunch specials even) on the "expensive" side of the scale The service was acceptable although I can only suspect the wait staff expects large tips from their hugely inflated bills Sadly they may not get any return customers with the quality of their food the way it is.
I was not greeted until I was about to leave out of the store the lady ( said she was the owner ) at the register clearly saw me as I was looking at some tanks right by the register she said NOTHING until I was about to head out that's when she wanted to ask if I was looking for anything in particular  I actually wasn't I just wanted to see what they had to offer being that it was my first time in the boutique  I asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is and that she has another location as well  Even if I would have received good customer service this definitely isn't a store that I'd be out on the prowl for the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated.
Make sure you order the day before so get your food in time If you come at night expect to wait 30-45 minutes.
From the other reveiews and what I have heard from a friend I might have to try narcisse again I was there for brunch this past sunday and was disappointed After being seated inside we waited 9 minutes before we were greeted Right when we were about to get up and leave our waitress finally appeared asking us if we would like to order a drink I ordered a nonfat cappucino and without even asking my boyfriend what he would like she just walked away clearly irritated that I had ordered a cappucino She came back a few minutes later saying they dont have nonfat milk We just weren't feeling it so we left and went somewhere else instead Im sure brunch is amazing but just the greeting we recieved left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Dr Rebbelke is the worst doctor ever Very rude and suggests hippy alternatives No one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives Front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time Why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority.
I hate this airport friendliest my ASS From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole Yup sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa Umm Lufthansa why do you code share with this abomination of an airline Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place PHX BOO.
OK yogurt way too expensive Yogurtini in Tempe has been my favorite Only 39 cents an ounce Better toppings and yogurt was definitely better.
This Paradise Bakery makes all the others look awful The people that work there do not even care when customers are around and will just say inappropriate things its okay with me BUT NOT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN I was very offended and they weren't even my kids This was honestly the last strike The second strike was a HAIR in my fruit salad I mean that is just gross and made me wonder why everyone behind the counter weren't wearing hair nets The first strike is they are always out of something or another like edamame That is what makes the Asian salad No point in getting it Its a shame that this Paradise Bakery is so awful because it is the closest one to my house Guess I will have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and 101 if I want Paradise.
Low budget teenage hangout What a joke never go back  Fix this place and hire real people that want to work not high school drop outs.
Bleh I can't believe this place has so many good reviews The quality of the food is very poor (I think their appetizers come from the freezer section of the grocery store) anne the preparation is even worse- meat and beans have hardly any flavor and the fried items are cold limp and greasy You'd think that would be enough but no- the menus table and silverware were dirty I would've walked out but it was someone's birthday Service was mediocre The only things positive were some of the decor and rooms to facilitate large parties.
Oh boy not a fan at all  Tottie's is right by my house so I checked the reviews and it appeared to be a good take out spot  I ordered a Thai noodle dish with Tofu and my Bf ordered Pad Thai I ordered both medium spice level  My Bf picked it up and he said the place spelled rancid not a good sign   Both of our meals were terrible had no sauce whatsoever and mine was so spicy it was inedible  I love spicy food so it's not that I can't tolerate the heat this was just bad  I threw out my meal and ate popcorn for dinner.
I have always been a fan of Golden Corral and their buffet But this particular location was terrible The food was so undercooked the fried fish was raw (sushi anyone) pizza dough was still raw and the variety was lacking It was not worth the amount we paid for especially for the lunch buffet I would highly recommend going to the location in Goodyear if you're willing to drive a little bit further.
Food was poor Nachos were burnt Waited 50 minutes for check 1 star is generous Not sure but I think the ribs were coyote.
If you like your hairdon't go.
I don't know why I continue to waste my time with this place - overpriced mediocre food and the most unfriendly staff in ArcadiaI guess I just want it to be good because of the location but I'm over itLast time I'm there we walk in and ask if we can watch the NBA Playoff game - the bar tender tells us he's rather watch the hockey so sorry  Pretty intense.
Server was lazy Noone here during NFL playoff game  First impressions dont lie  Food was good  Out od three of my first choices of craft beer  Dont bother.
Worst dining experience in years So upon arrival there is a line outside so I ask my wife to get down and see what the wait is She comes back out and says 15-20 minutes Okay park the truck and wait 45-50 minutes later I'm asking the host & hostess what happened to the 15-20 minute time that we were quoted "well there was this party of 16 that is just finishing up so" I then let him know that if that was the case why didn't he communicate that with us So then he says it'll be just 5 more minutes and it was when we were seated in a dirty area Our server brought us our drinks but there was no silverware to stir our coffee After we get silverware then we fail to see our server again for a while Running out of coffee and creamer now we're without beverages while we wait for the food The food comes out but 2 people are missing their meals 15 minutes go by before they get their food both children so that made them feel all warm and fuzzy Oh yeah ran out of coffee again The children's food make it out and our server says that he'll take those off of the bill When the bill arrives he took off the least expensive meal (not the 2 that failed to show up on time) and charged us for an extra orange juice I ask for the manager at this point and let him know that I've just had the worst dining experience in years He apologizes and asks how he can make it right to which I reply do whatever is within your power He discounted the ticket 25% We lost over 2 hours of our day and more considering this is one of three feedbacks that I will be providing The server said he knows the next experience will be better There probably won't be another experience there but I would hope that if there was one that it couldn't get much worse than that.
Awful drinks The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.
and the 1 star is being super kind  My husband and I walked into the restaurant around 8:30 pm and was seated by a hostess that never made eye contact with us  Never  Then we were helped by a server that and I'm almost positive hates her job and doesn't want to be there  Again no eye contact but whateverWe started off with the mozzarella- horrible  It came out still dripping in grease and the taste was of old cooking oilI had the fettuccini and it was terrible  I've had better out of a jar at homeOur bill was stupid for the amount of crappy food that we had  I usually feel bad saying terrible things about a joint but not in this case  They should just shut it downI am confident in my next statement- I will never in my life eat at this place even if it's between life and death  I'd much rather dieOn the plus side the water was cold.
Awful awful awful  Tickets said 5 PM so we got there for 3:30 so we could get set up early  The parking lot doesn't open until 4:30okay  So we figured we'd kill time and got some food  In the meantime the lines to get in the parking lot become a clusterfun  Finally open the parking lot gates  And now time to wait in line to get in the actual ampitheater  We were front of the line so we were talking to the security ladies who were nice  Then they couldn't figured out if gates opened at 5 or 5:30  Some may complain about the cell phone policy but that was the comedy acts rule and not the ampitheater rule from what i can tell  Gates finally open we're excited to get to our lawn seats so we can set up and get comfortableoh but the lawn doesn't open until 6 PMwhat  So we have to walk around with our blanket and bag for another hour  I guess that will force us to buy your overpriced beer and food  Only two acts were going to be on the main stage and the rest were going to be on another stage () but no one we asked seemed to know where this stage was  It was frustrating so realizing we only paid $20 each for the tickets we decided to leave about 15 minutes after we entered the gates  The disorganization was to a level I have never seen before  The whole experience was horrible  I can't think of any event that could drag me back to this hellhole.
Wow what a disappointment  I ended up in your restaurant with a referral from my mother in-law After being seated we were slowly greeted by an underwhelmed lack luster waitress named carrie only to find out half way through our meal Carrie was pushy and obnoxious about taking our order and only after sorting out the terribly confusing two menus we decided on our meals My mothers order came without the fries she ordered and I'm pretty sure our final checks were not correct Not only do I believe the prices are above average I was charged for two separate drinks I understand mix ups but I feel more as if this particular situation was intentional unfortunate Not only was service below par I had to ask for refills on my own drinks because the attention to our table was so overlooked Adding insult to injury we were the only table in carries section aside from one man pulled up to the bar The food was poor the service sucked for lack of a better word and overall nothing worth coming back for For a personal referral I'm  disappointed and frustrated in this experience what a shame.
This is a late night drive-thru liquor store rebranded to appear upscale The clientele seems to consist of people on their way to a party alcoholics and homeless people The owners are rude and unfriendly The place reeks and is a large source of nuisance and pollution to the surrounding neighborhood Lots of smash & grab crime on the surrounding street Overpriced goods Definitely NOT the place to go if you are actually looking for a decent selection of fine wines.
I have never encountered such horrible customer service I have very long hair and have been thinking about cutting about 10 inches off and before I did wanted to try out a wig to make sure I wouldn't hate the short look on me I went into wig land hoping to find a wig I could test out for a couple of weeks but the lady working said I couldn't try on most of the wigs because my hair was too long So when I asked what I could try on and told her my reason for wig shopping she told me I couldn't try on anything and that her wigs are "not for play" and if I want to cut my hair to just cut it Even after I tried to explain that I wanted to buy a wig she just keep saying I couldn't try on anything She was extremely rude and I would never recommend this store to anyone.
Subway is better any day.
The place looked interesting thought Id give it a try bad idea  Service is average - Food NOT good  Burger was dry flavor bland and on horrible bread  Even didnt like the fries really The price of the burgers a bit high  Best burger Ive had in town is the GRIND costs $12 bad burgers should be $7-8.
At first look this is a great company We recently purchased a house from smokers so we had to have the ENTIRE interior of a 2700 sq ft house repainted (closets ceilings EVERYTHING) David came out to give a quote and was very nice and professional Explained everything to us Stated they were going to roll the walls instead of spray so that in the future if we have to touch them up you can't see the brushstrokes We had never considered this and were impressed that the information was offered and explained as we had assumed spraying which would be MUCH faster and easier of a project of this size Day 1: the 2 painters clogged and flooded the hall bathroom toilet so there was sewer water UNDER the plastic taped to protect the floor from paint No apologies from either of them Fast forward a week when the painting is done Walls were painted incorrect colors the rope lighting on a ledge near the ceiling was not put back light fixtures were still taped over tape was still on the edge of carpet and ceilings and windows When we called the head painter Richard he came back corrected the paint colors and rope lighting without grumble but was supposed to remove all the tape and uncover fixtures but didn't We STILL were unable to get in touch with David They also sprayed the walls and when contacted we David he never got back to us and even Richard said he couldn't get a hold of him Not only did they spray but when we went to get the leftover paint cans to touch up some dings from moving in and installing granite they were full of WATER that they used to clean out the sprayer So in essence we have NO extra paint in ANY of the 4 colors we used They were also supposed to paint the ceiling in a flat paint so that there would be no glare and visible spray linesguess what Its NOT flat paint and glares and spray lines are VERY visibleThere are many paint smudges on windows that we had to clean off and were hanging a clock the other day and saw a dirty hand print from one of them where they must have braced themselves on the wall when climbing a ladder  2 weeks later we are still trying to get in touch with them and just opened another can of supposedly "extra" paint and found it full of trash NASTY I would NEVER recommend them to ANYONE and we should have gone with another company Saving $500 has NOT been worth the headache to not even get a call back from David Richard the head painter did always followed up with us and respond to calls but the details of trash disposal and tape removal were seriously lacking.
So we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party They got 2 pizzas wrong We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologiesAre we ever going back Nope.
I eat at McDonaldsI grew up on happy meals :)  Every so often I feel like having the Mcdonald fries(when I am having my cheat meal)In review of this Mcdonalds I sometimes avoid this one and go to another so I can enjoy my fries and food  This is the closest one to my house but when I have a McDonalds craving I would like to have "good" McDonalds  I want salty lightly greased fries this McDonalds always lacks salt dry fries and most of the time they are give me luke warm fries  By the time I get home the fries are cold  I live within a mile of this one  If you are looking to enjoy some McDonalds fries this McDonalds never seems to get the taste right and I avoid it when I get that craving If you want salt less fries cold buns on your burger visit this McDonalds.
If you have to be some place on time don't use them  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner and gave me his location  Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address"  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor  As we pulled out of my neighborhood we PASSED the cab He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost This is a TAXI service they should know how to get around the valley  Don't these people use GPS or MAPS at least  End of story I was still late for my class that I paid 25000 bucks for I was not allowed in and the money is non refundable  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
Unlike the previous reviewer I dont think my attitude had anything to do with my bad experience   I think it had more to do with half (of the already skimpy menu) being sold out by the time we were finally seated  During our 3 hour wait (which we planned for) one of our group of six had to walk back to the car (parked almost a mile away due to there being no where else to park) to get their medication  Of course we were called to the table when they were 2 blocks away and even though we had 5 out of 6 people and swore the last was walking here that very moment they said we would have to wait  Less than 2 minutes later the last person arrived and we let the hostess know and then waited another 45 minutes and watched her seat 4 other tables before us as if to show us just who was running the show around here  We pretty much had to order what was left on the menu after playing the "we're out of that" game with the waiter 4X and when the food finally did come I was hungry enough to think play-doh spaghetti was a delicacy  It wasn't particularly bad  The ingredients were fresh enough but it just wasn't nearly anything special enough to warrant the hassle  I'm only reviewing this place tonight because I just came from Christopher's and had a pizza that puts this place to shame for about the same price and a fraction of the snobbery.
This place is not good and not worth the prices I suggest you drive up the street to In-N-Out and save yourself some $$The burger menu is over hyped and Smashburger doesn't deliver Please don't use truffle mayo and call the burger a truffle burger You are not UmamiThe buns here are soggy and gross and the meat here is tasteless Don't go here.
Since we knew Baseball Spring Training was a busy time we made a 3/23/11 reservation at this restaurant on March 6 2011 via phone (they don't use Open Table) at 3:00 pm (I have phone records to prove it)  We asked for an inside table at 7:00 pm and were assured it was reserved  However when we arrived for our reservation last night it was not to be found - and the hostess blew us off as though we were trying to scam our way in  Since they don't use Open Table or email I have no written proof but didn't think as a "customer" it was up to us to re-confirm the reservation  Although we have enjoyed this restaurant in the past their recent notice in SF Chron seems to have gone to their head  They need to improve their reservation system so this doesn't happen to others who have the foresight to make advance reservationsJeanSan Francisco.
I really wanted to like this place since my first experience at Centurion was so good Unfortunately after two attempts here I've given up The first attempt at eating at the bar came last Sunday We stopped in around 1 pm looking for a sandwich After being seated they inform us that only the brunch menu is available OK but by brunch menu they mean breakfast There are no typical lunch items available No problem so we place our order for the Wisconsin scones A few minutes later the waiter returned to inform us that they're out of hamburger meat At this point nothing else on the menu looks appetizing so we leave  I think no big deal this happens now and againWe decide to return the following Saturday and meet a friend for brunch This time full well knowing that means breakfast only We sit down and all order a bloody mary As the waitress is walking away she turns around to inform is that they are out of scones Out of scones That removes 1/3 of their menu I'm in disbelief that this happened again but really wanting to like this place we just decide to look for other options on the menu Then the waitress returns again and informs us that they're out of bloody mary mix  That was it for us As much as I wanted like this place that kind of management is inexcusable  I hope they can get it together but I don't plan on going back again just to be burned  Too bad because that Wisconsin Scone sounds amazing If they ever had all the ingredients there at the same time.
I for one have a general dislike for ALL circle K's Everyone I have ever been to including this one has been filthy with people full of tattoos and piercings and bandaids covering up their hickeys working thereI have nothing against tattoos or piercings but  come on you are working cover that up It always takes forever and their customer service sucks Circle K you need to make some major changes if you want your company not to be overrun by the more customer oriented convenience stores.
We travel a lot and Total Wine is always one of our first stops when we get where we are going Every other Total Wine in all other locations 5 star I would give this one -5 if I could Not only is it small over crowded dusty and has boxes in the aisles there is no one to help you find anything in the crammed together mess when you do find someone they are clueless about their products The registers always seem to have people training and thee trainers are often rude to the customer and downright mean to the trainees  On one of our trips over Christmas my 70 year old husband was refused his purchase because he didn't take his wallet just took some cash and couldn't prove he was of age to purchase alcohol I am dead serious We travel to Scottsdale every few weeks to visit our kids Fry's will be our soul provider of wine beer and spirits from this last trip forward By the way the favorite all time Total Wine to date St Pete FL.
Yeah i'm gonna go ahead and down-grade my rating from my previous review The lack of awareness and attention you get as a customer is very inadequate I have ordered take out and dined in since my last review and just wasn't pleased at all 1 with the quality of the food and 2 with their customer serviceAnother long wait until our server showed up I wanted to leave but my I didn't want to be like that It is just ridiculous to me that it would take soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for anyone to address you once seated I won't miss this place too much aside from the Bacon Won Tons oh well.
I ordered a double burrito meaning two burritos lengthwise The incompetent workers then proceeded to fill my scrawny excuse of a burrito with very scant and stingy single scoop portions I ordered and PAYED for 2 burritos and it came out looking like an average sized burrito I was a regular customer and I 100% to ever return to this location Don't go the people working are imbeciles.
This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my entire life I wish I could say I am exaggerating but this really topped every bad experience I've ever had in the past The entire experience was bad from beginning to end We came in for a Thanksgiving meal and the hour we endured ruined the entire holidayThe service here was beyond terrible We were 1 of 3 tables being served so it wasn't busy at all - but we were treated like they had a full house and a line of people waiting out the door It all began when we weren't greeted The woman hurriedly walked up to us and looked at us as if we came in to ask a question I said "two please" and she replied "two what" I repeated myself "Two for here please" And then the fun beganIt took us about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waiter/owner When we asked for a coke and diet coke he angrily took our teacups away and returned with our sodas about 10 minutes later I'm not sure what we did to tick him off but he sure was upset that we came inWhen we inquired about the price of crab he told us "Ummmm ummmmmmmmm $4500 Some are bigger some are smaller" and very quickly walked away said something to the lady working there and walked in the back Finally he came back and took our order We ordered in Chinese he confirmed it in EnglishThe food certainly didn't take long to arrive - so much so that the paper wrapped chicken was still partially raw in the center and the peppered beef was uncooked halfway through The dishes themselves were presentable but very very small and pricey for a typical Chinese joint We never complained about the raw food The owner added an additional dish about 5 minutes after we began to eat He became very upset with us when we told them we didn't order it and asked him to take it back We weren't rude about the mistake with the additional dish but he quickly got an attitude with us and began to argue with us about the dish and wanted us to take responsibility for it He refused to serve us the for remainder of the meal and had the other lady working there give us our check We certainly won't be returning and I hope that anyone else who braves this establishment has a better experience than we did.
I went to The Carwasher this morning to have my 2 month old BMW 650 cleaned and had a very unpleasant experience I arrived and was greeted in the following way "what's up boss" I would not regard this as a professional greeting but I am willing to look past it I proceeded to purchase the more expensive of two wash options they offered for $1199 which was considered "full service" I went through the tunnel and continued to the area where they hand dry and do a basic "detail" After 5 minutes of their "once over" on the car the manager called out "HEY" to let me know the car was done again sub par professionalism The car was still dripping wet with no armor all on the tires or utilization of the air hose to remove the water from the door jams etc I said to the manager "are you sure you are done last time I was here they applied armor all and dried the car completely" He said can you usually get armor all applied for just $1199 at other car washes" By this time I was sensing his sarcastic arrogance and replied "well 3 months ago I came here and received that service level and it was $400 cheaper at $799 and unless your armor all cost has increased by greater than $400 per car I would expect the same now does that make sense to you" His response was "we are going to do you a favor and apply the armor all this time" He followed up by saying there were upgrade options above the "full service" level (that I was never made aware of at purchase by the way) that include armor all etc and I only got the "basic service" I then proceeded to point to the roadside sign that clearly depicts "full service" - $1199 "basic service" - $599 showed him my receipt that says "full service" and finally he was speechless Customer service is paramount in this tough economy where competition is fierce between companies it would be in your best interest to address these staffing concerns before you lose additional customers to the competition Bottom line if you are going to charge top dollar for a car wash make sure you are at least offering a parallel service as your competitors I will NOT be coming back here again as a result of their lack of customer appreciation and abusive customer treatment.

To Serve or Not Serve Hello Yelpers Recently  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice  After receiving "no response" I thought I might as well add this to my " Yelp" reviews"  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or in my case to never come back again  Rather then writing a strategic rant I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters September 23 2013 Corporate Office of Golden Corral I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd Goodyear Arizona (623) 925-9075  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service  However my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest   On Saturday September 21 around 1130 AM I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 pm and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall)  To be fair the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes That was nice my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back  The manager asked if I had "touched the rolls" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make "bread pudding"  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven My concern lies in the area of food health and safety issues  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation  However I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling preparation and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is the food ought to be safe and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location Thanks Dxxxx Gxxxxxxx 1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave Xxxxxxxx  Arizona xxx-xxx-xxxx.
I don't know what all the hype is about this placeI find their deserts pretty disgusting and i have tried numerous ones because so many people rave about them  They have all tasted like metal and the cookies are always dry and hard on the outside and chewy on the inside  I like my cookies to have a consistent textureThey don't have any vegan optionsTheir coffee is horrible  It always tastes burnt and they charge $75 for soy  Most places no longer charge for soy or if they do it is $25  I feel $75 is exorbitantI am done giving this place one more shot.
DON'T EXPECT HOUSTON'SWe heard Houston's became Hillstone so as very loyal customers to Houston's (going 2+ times per month) for years we were excited to try Hillstone on Camelback What a disappointment The service was just awful very cold and impersonal one person in our group said "hoity toity" and the food was more expensive and not as quality compared to Houston's menu Everything about Hillstone is the opposite of Houston's Where the seating and atmosphere at Houston's was warm and inviting at Hillstone it is cold and impersonal Yes obviously much money was spent on Hillstone but in our opinion to its disadvantage because of its slight ostentatious presentation It is pretty but something about it felt offWe tried Hillstone two times in case the first time was a fluke but our experience was the same as the first Bummer for them because at our favorite restaurants we always tip 30-45% of our billIn their defense two things:1) Our experience was from the first year it opened which I noticed there are so many similar reviews to mine from that time so maybe they made some adjustments and2) Maybe they are not trying to be like Houston's which is fine for them but not for us We miss Houston's and wanted a version of it Hillstone is not it So we will keep searching.
Horrible Go to burger king insteadis that bad.
I was liking this place but the handle was so hard to push down I did it and it hurt me when it came up  It feels bruised and it almost took me away from eating but wow they need to fix that I don't like it and it's not safe for little kids to be doing that  The yogurt is nice I like all the selections they have and topping are neat too like brownies crushed cookies and marshmallows Staff is nice too but my hand still hurts.
Well once again the service was awful  WHY does a restaurant think that a cute young gal at the hostess station means anything if she is useless   We walked in and stood in front of the hostess stand this blonde looked at us and said nothing   I thought she didn't work thereI said " do you know where the hostess is"  She said " I am the hostess "  I was floored   Was she ever trained  How the f*#@ did she ever get that job  She sat us at a large table 8 of us for happy hour and apps/dinner  Gave half of us menus and said nothing  we waited  and waitedI went back to her and said " Is anyone waiting on our table"  Now she has a little bit of an attitudeI would of just left right there but I had 7 other friends to think about  We finally got a waiter   Anyway  I could go on and on  our order came out in bits and pieces over a 10 - 15 minute spansushi here6 mins later a burger there 5 minutes later my beer ( that was ordered first mind you )  Poorly run restaurantwas not even worth calling over a managerYou know sometimes you just throw your hands into the air and say " whats the point in calling over a manager"  I will NEVER go back thereway too many other fun restaurants to spend my hard earned $$$ at   The sad thing is  that entire City North area ( which could be a cool spot) is hurting anyway  and Kona Grill sure isn't helping draw people back.
Sometimes in life you winSometimes you looseToday I lostReluctant to go in shady strip mall uninviting exterior  But asked a few people coming out if the food was any good and they said "Excellent" "Been eating here for 10 years"  So we thought sure that is a great endorsement from strangersWhat were they smokingWalked into a empty Restaurant at noon only to find a very modern decor and thought OK it is clean and I like the stainless steel table topsAnd that is when what I liked came to an end:Started with the most boring lukewarm soup in the World the Wonton Noodle soup bland is the motto here  And I like my soup hot by the way WTFNext came the lunch not-so-specials:1) Wife: had the sweet and sour special boring  But worst of all it appeared undercooked so we told the very nice lady and she assured us that it is cooked twice once before customer orders and once after and again I say WTF  That doesn't sound good  They brought her a new order but wife insists the chickens had a strange McNugget texture to it2) Me: the bland and uninspiring House Special Chicken bland boring fried rice no carrots or peas or egg in it just boring fried rice  And the egg roll is a spring roll and I hate spring rolls  My chicken was cooked but it wasn't very good  Drowned in garlic and some dull brown sauceAnd the worst of all: the bill (for lunch brau)$2799 (before tip) for 2 teas 2 not-so-lunch-specials and the worst soup known to manShame actually if they put as much effort into their dull food as they do the interior then it could be goodWon't be back  Rule of thumb if a Restaurant is empty at Prime lunch hour it is for a reason.
Food was okay nothing to rave about   But the service Oh the service  We chose to eat in the bar table  area the waitress was just shamefully bad   Ignoring tables  getting orders wrong but she came up to the table and proclaimed "I totally forgot about you guys " then laughed and said that "at least I'm honest "  That was the last straw   We've given you several opportunities to earn our business and you've not taken advantage of a single one.
Coffee is always lukewarm and today I went thru the drive thru and was asked to pull up and wait for my coffee and waited 15 mins and no coffee I had to go so no coffee I called the store 12 times from 1 - 3 PM and never got anyone to answer the phone I physically went to the store at 3:45 and the manager apologized but offered no compensation for my aggravation 4807855418 is the corporate number.
After two negative experiences I wanted to give this location another chance only to be severely disappointed once againUpon walking into the door I am greeted (if you can call it that) with a "What's the last name" The girl behind the counter obviously could care less about customer service since she gave less than none Not even a hint of a smile The girl looked as if she were going over everything else she would rather be doing in her head I felt not only unwelcome but disrespected as a paying customerI came with a friend who had never done a spray tan before and I let the girl explain to her how to do it I myself have worked in a tanning salon for over 5 years and every direction that the girl gave my friend was 100% wrong To keep my friend from having her spray tan ruined I explained the correct way for her to apply barrier cream pose etc When it came my turn for the spray tan I stepped into the booth onto the metal plate and was pracitcally standing in a puddle (a problem I had had before) I went up to the front and asked (very politely) if she could please wipe down the plate because it was still very wet Not only did the girl roll her eyes at me but she did not entirely wipe the plate I was still standing in wetness during my sprayOn top of everything else I ended up having water drip on me from the ceiling of the booth due to the fact that the machine had not been properly wiped down after sanitization Any vet spray tanner will know how detrimental having water drip on you during a spray tan can be It goes without saying that I will not be returning to this location any more and neither will my friend If any managers are reading this and are interested to know who the girl was that was working I visited on 10/7/12 at 6 pm at the Tempe location.
worst customer service and the manager was not so friendly It used to be better when Boca7 was opened back then.
Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner  I sent my food back and left  :(.
The worst public golf I've ever experienced in the many years I've been golfing with friends We were approached on the 2nd hole on a Saturday morning and told that we had to play ready-ball It wasn't that busy so no need at all to be interrupted and hassled on several holes The only reason my game got slowed down was because this Steve guy was watching us (distracting us) on every hole and asking for our receipts twice Steve later on apologized but when I told him I wanted a refund he never did anything  We had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs I didn't get what I paid for.
My fiance and I were out running errands around town this past weekend and passed by this place  I mentioned wanting to try it sometime and that I had been to a place with the same concept many years ago in Tempe and thought it was really cool  After we were done running errands we were headed back the same direction and came up to Ghenghis and he pulled in the parking lot and suggested we go ahead and try it  We walk in and wait to be seated like the sign says right off the bat I notice several employees walk by without even acknowledging us  Then this male employee walks over with a bewildered look on his face like he clearly is not used to seating people  I thought he'd figure it out since it's not exactly a large restaurant  We should have just grabbed a seat at their bar  He told us someone would be right with us and a girl came over and sat usright next to the server station  Whatever I was starving and didn't really care at that time  Neither one of us had been there so our waitress who sat us rapidly explained the process she went thru it so fast I just decided we should fill out their form and have them make our bowls for us  When she got back to us for our order we ordered drinks I got a coke and he ordered a beer  We proceeded to sit there for about 20 minutes meanwhile at the table next to us some people sat down after us and were brought their meals and were almost done  Our waitress comes over and says our food should be out any minute not long after that another woman comes over ( I assume the manager since she wasn't wearing a server uniform) and says that they are out of two of the seafood items that my fiance had ordered  He changed his order and we continued to wait all the while thinking why the hell didn't they tell us that in the first place  Then as we waited and waited some more I started wondering why our waitress said our food should be out soon when they clearly hadn't even started cooking it yet if they didn't even possess the food to cook it  By this point I was extremely hungry and irritated I had half a coke left his beer was empty and the waitress comes by and drops off a fresh coke that I felt like she did only to try and make up for our wait  But maybe she should have thought of asking if my fiance wanted another beer since his was empty  She did stop to ask if they had told us they were out of his order and said she would take our bowls off whatever that meant  We continued to wait a few more minutes until I just couldn't wait any longer  We got up to leave and walked passed the manager lady sitting at a bar table who said thanks for comingya thanks for NOTHING  They weren't even what I would call busy  I have never had to walk out on service like that  I was looking forward to a cool new experience and ended up being extremely disappointed  I will never go there again.
I've been to yogurt mart two times now  Initially I was excited to a yogurt place walking distance from my friend's home who I visit frequently  The first time it was passible the person ringing us out was nice The place looked clean but it was missing a sparkly new feeling that I can't quite describe The yogurt was not original or memorable but it was good enough that going to another place was not worth the gasThe second time we went there (last night) it was about 45 minutes to closing time  The pistachio was completely liquid the chocolate cappuccino and red velvet came out looking thin and gloopy (like diarrhea) I ended up starting a new cup three times chose a sorbet flavor that wasn't my first second or third choice  The friend I was with noticed less topping available than there were last time  I didn't even feel like yogurt anymore when we paid  Again the guy ringing us out was nice but that wasn't quite enoughThe place needs a facelift a new name (really Yogurt Mart) and more time and quality control needs to be put into the yogurt selection  Yuck.
Went to Zen for lunch today with a friendwaited at the hostess station for a server to seat usno one camefinally the chef said we could sit anywherewe sat downwaited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menusnever happenedwe got up and left without ever seeing anyone They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but usthis was sadwe saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us but none approached us Very sadplus the place smelled like bad fishthis place has gone way down hillsad Worse service ever.
Um is this place a jokeI really don't understand how this place has so many good reviews  I came here because it seemed popular and had a pretty good rating on Yelp but I really don't understand how maybe all the ASU kids are impressed by the modern interior design  Maybe they're sick of their meal plan food  Or maybe people are just hungover and any breakfast food tastes goodAnyways-The service was awful  Not one single person had a personality or even a glimpse of a smile  There was about 20 people "working" but doing absolutely nothing  Workers were just aimlessly wandering around the dining room standing behind the counter in a daze or fist bumping their friends talking about how wasted they got the previous night (no joke)-The place was a messThere was food and garbage ALL over the ground  The drink station countertop was a sticky disgusting mess spills lemon seeds used napkins allll over it  The place was pretty busy but any empty table was still covered in the previous customer's dishes and food mess  (Which I didn't understand since there were 3 workers wandering around the dining room at all times)  I had to flag down a dazed employee and ask them to clear a table off for me  And of course he just wiped even more food onto the already disgusting floor  Seriously food ALL over the floor  Gross-The food took forever and was coldWe waited about 25 minutes for a super simple order of food  I got the Farmer's Market  The whole entree was cold  And NOBODY likes cold soggy potatoes  It was supposed to have avocado on it but it had one mere sliver  My boyfriend's food was also cold and he didn't eat it  We would have said something to someone about a refund or getting at least warm-ish food instead but everyone was too busy wandering around in a zombie daze and at that point I just wanted to get the hell out of that disgusting placeAnd there was awful music playing like music that plays really loud in a club  Like loud Britney Spears and hip-hop  It was just weird  I would never come back here and would advise anyone (unless you like cold food disgusting places and awful service) to try another place for breakfast/lunch insteadEw.
Ok I liked this place when it had coffee and I like the murals on the walls outside but the whole preachy whiny and better/cooler than you vibe is really a turn off I would normally not review a local mom and pop type place badly but I was walking by and there was a jogger passing this place and the people at Conspire made fun of him yelled at him teased him  and laughed and him as he ran by What a bunch of jerks I understand that this is not the business owners but this is the type of atmosphere they have created supported and invited Jeez I'm taking my money where the people aren't meanNot to mention the constant whining by a female there that says she's one of the owners Hey I just wanted to buy something and support a local business I don't need to know how badly you are being treated by your neighbors It's your problem deal with it.
We have been to Pearl many times and always found mediocre service but the food has always been pretty good Tonight was the last time I will ever go to Pearl We received 3/5 rolls and then nothing for about 30 minutes We were patient and finally asked that if they weren't being made we would just take the check and skip the other two Tracy (male) our server had no idea what we had even ordered He then asked why our el diablo roll was half eaten We said we did not really like it He returned a while later with the check no discount applied for half of our dinner missing or the food we didn't like We put a card down right away and he continued to flirt with the table next to us Needless to say we won't be back There is better sushi in Old Town with much better service Very disappointing night.
My wife and I had friends visiting from California so booked some spa appointments about a month out and planned to spend the day at the pool  Luckily (we thought) my wife called to confirm the appointments the week before and found that they had both the times and the treatments wrong  The spa representative corrected them and we thought all was well  As we were driving up to the hotel at about 1:10 for our 2:00 appointments the telephone rang asking where we were and why we weren't there yet  We explained the earlier mixup and that our appointments were actually at 2:00  The reply was "sorry there is nothing we can do now" We asked to see the manager and got a "really sorry we don't have any openings"  Apparently the Biltmore is not responsible for their own ineptitude  Half our group ended up getting no spa treatments at all  Guess what they offered us in compensationthey covered the spa gratuitygee thanks  After ruining our day you covered the gratuity for your own employees  No discount no promise of future compensation nada  I'd like to mention that all areas of the spa have the styling of a high school locker room crossed with a Motel 6  Sad     We wandered over to the pool to use the cabana we had rented for the day for about $250  The last time the cabanas were renovated was about 1986 based on the condition and the decor  I'm not sure how they were able to acquire the frost-filled fridge from my college dorm room but there it was right along with the 20 year old tube TV The interior was in bad need of painting as there was peeling and mildew in many areas  It really takes away from the whole experience  Sorry Biltmore you are a shade of your former self       My advice is to drive a few miles to Montelucia where you will find an elegant up to date spa with great therapists for the same price  The pool and cabanas there are absolutely beautiful.
I brought my car to Allen's because my headlights stopped working They were very nice and got my car in quickly They gave me a quote of $631 for a replacement headlight dimmer switch After the initial sticker shock I decide to research the part myself I found the part online for $199 when Allen's was charging $460 When I called and questioned them about it they said that is what NAPA quoted them Sooooo I called NAPA The price they gave me was $350 (still $110 less than Allen's told me) I decided to order the part and change it myself I feel like they were trying to get more money out of me unfairly My quote from them has an "other charge" of $20 on top of the part from NAPA being marked up $110 I'm sad and disappointed that they tried to scam me out of money I can't comment on the quality of their work as I decided not to go use their services All I can comment on is that I feel as though they were dishonest in their part price quote I will not be using or referring Allen's in the future.
Zero supplies (eg Flat rate envelopes) in the self service area Now have to make another trip Also there was a handwritten sign made out to the attention of "costumers".
Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
We have been here 3 times this year Like other reviewers we really want to make this restaurant a regular stop as we live around the corner We were in last Sunday morning for brunch with neighborhood friends Its always amazing that they are out of things that they should have ample stock This trip it was chorizo and diet coke  As usual the service is super friendly by the same waitress we have everytime Brunch menu was expensive and some of the items we ordered were not very good The waffles are served with whipped cream and whatever fruit topping you order They were extremely dry and should be served with some type of syrup Instead they make a point of telling you there is no syrup Some of the other items were very small portions and they couldn't have $ 200 in food cost but charge between 10-1400  As everyone in the restaurant is within 10' of the owner/chef you would expect some conversation from him Nothing The one thing he did do was to argue with a man and his family over an on line coupon Everytime we go there someone is questioning the charges or the discount entitled them from the coupon  Nice touch as we don't have one and are paying full price for poor food  One two three strikes your out.
What a shame Found this on yelp and thought that I would surprise my Colombian wife with some real Latin American foodFinally found the place behind the Taco Bell on Bell Rd and sat down to examine the menu Wow what a diverse selection and Bandeja PaisaIt took a while to get our drinks and to order our food Only 11 other people in the room so not busyAfter 90 minutes we gave up paid for our drinks and went home The 6 top next to us had been waiting almost 2 hours with only an empanada to show for it During our visit we saw 5 plates come out of the kitchen That's 1 plate every 20 minutesI've been around the restaurant/hotel business for 30 years and have never seen such a miserable situation Either scale the menu back to something manageable or give it up.
Not impressed  saw a couple reviews that were not stellar should have listened  Pancake was as heavy as the plate it was sitting on & the omelette veggies were supposed to be roasted nope raw  Sorry 1st & last time I'm here.
Does it shock you that this place blows Does it really Ok let me back up as I'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth I for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of Scottsdale clubs foster But this place really takes the cakeI'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor so the overall appearance of the place (gawdy mostly) doesn't bother me at all It's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation The food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard The waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny distracting objects to provide any standard of service And the management my are they pretty Pretty uselessBut I'll rip the term "doucheburger" right from Jake C (that's awesome by the way): this place is filled with 'em Whom I'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars (those two terms rhyme a little try them together I bet you'll like it).
Ok one star not because the food is bad not because the service is bad to be honest I have no idea I have never got that far I tried but the smell was so bad after a few minutes I was running for the door.
This place is WAYYYY too full of itself and substandard to receive anything more than a single star rating First off their ID checkers have the arrogance and attitude of New York club bouncers - Hey fellas don't flatter yourselves it's a crappy dive bar (just because you get some low-end Scottsdale yuppies as regulars doesn't mean you're big time K) Thought they were bouncing at Studio 54 or somethingNext up the last two times I lowered my standards and entered this place I GOT NO SERVICE AT ALL I stood/sat up at the inside bar for a full 5 mins once and like a minute the next time and said "Fuck this place I'm never coming back here" Then when I went to leave I had to go through a phalanx of overly self-important security goons and basically told them off It's kind of a shame too because this place is like a 10 min walk from my house No on second thought it's no shame at all For me The shame is on them Whatever.
I used to love this place but lately I've been noticing that they have a bug problem Last time I was there I saw a roach looking type of bug scurrying up the wall My sister brought her visiting friend here and there was a bug on the plate of sushi When they told the server she looked at the bug and then squashed it with her finger on the plate This is highly disgusting It makes me wonder f there's bugs in the dining room what does the back kitchen look likeI really hate to give this place a bad review because they food was good prices are cheap and who can beat a $5 sake bomb But after these experiences with witnessing bugs I'm never going back.
Well what can I say  Wow  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth  I am not exaggerating  It was very very painfulIt started with the hostess  A "5-10" minute wait was all she said  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names  OK no problem mistakes happen we understand  She says we get the next 2 person table  Cool  As we are waiting I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us  After some questioning she allegedly crossed out their names too  Umm really  The girl had no clueFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient  OK we are patient  We order our food a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich  As we are waiting and waiting and waiting we hear the waitress scolding customers"I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer you chose to wait  Really   At another table she says the same thing  The table next to us once they get their food complain and leave without even touching it  Oh myApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above took 70 minutes to get to usYES 70 MINUTES  I can't believe we waited that long  We were so mad but at some point we were too investedOnce the food comesno chips  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet  ReallyThe food was decent no complaints there  Every single table though was mad and upset about the wait  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and I eat out A LOTAnyway stay away from this place  They don't deserve your business  This by the way is also the first "bad" review I have ever written They should be ashamed.
If there was ever a prime candidate for the public ax in these lean times it would be this library  It really offers nothing more than some air conditioning a couple of 1990's era Sports Illustrated's and some half empty book shelves  My illiterate nephew has a bigger book collection than this place  The middle of the Sonoran desert has more electrical outlets and workstations than this "library"  I'm sorry  I love libraries and books and all but I just don't see much learning coming out of this place  There are some great alternatives in the area (Burton Barr and Scottsdale).
Went with friends for my wife's birthday dinner The evening started off okay Went to the front area to check-in and get our buzzer Our friends hadn't arrived yet so waiting wasn't going to be much of an issue Told the girl that we would be having 6 total guests but 2 were a surprise for my wife so please make sure the staff doesn't say anything and to only have 4 place settings at the table I also told her it was my wife's birthday and to do whatever they do special for birthdays (Cheesy singing by the waitstaff included)We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited WAY overpriced drinks here $16 for a Merlot and a pina colada Strike 1Our pager goes off so I go up to have the staff seat us I remind the girl up front that the head count is a surprise for my wife's birthday The hostes takes us to our booth and says "party of six" to which I replied to her "no it's 4" So she went ahead and removed 2 of the 6 place settings Strike 2Our friends arrived shortly after we were seated They were brought over to sit with us and we ordered our drinks and appetizers Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good Everyone else also enjoyed the avocado rolls So far the food is showing some promise over the dumb staffI ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo Everyone else was half through their dinners before I got my dish When it arrived the only thing resembling gumbo was the rice After the first taste it was very bland and resembled some kind of creamy stew of unknown origin Our waiter came by to ask if everything was okay and how the gumbo was After I told him it was so-so he just asked "just okay" smiled and walked away No checking to see if I wanted something else insteadAbout halfway through the gumbo I started to not feel well Our group ordered dessert which they were all gushing over after it arrived Unfortunately the girl up front never shared with anyone that it was my wife's birthday I had to say something to the waiter who smiled said Happy Birthday came back after 5 minutes with a couple of waitresses none of which looked thrilled to be there sang happy birthday dropped off what was supposed to be a sundae and walked awayAfter a bit my face started to swell I grabbed a waitress to ask if they happened to put clams in the gumbo which I am severely allergic to After checking with the chef she came back to inform me that they put clam juice in it Anyone who knows about gumbo knows that the classic recipe doesn't have any clams or clam juice in it And the menu has no claims of allergy causing foodsAfter a 20 minute ordeal of just trying to get the check so I could go get some pills from the nearby CVS we were able to cash out and go That was about the most embarassing and painful 20 minutes I've had in some time When I first said something to the waitress a woman came out from the back and simply said we're sorry touched my shoulder and went in the back again Our waiter came by asked if anyone came by to say anything and saw that I was having trouble seeing the bill to split it He offered to split the bill for us At no time did he offer to get a manager to come talk to us Shortly after the waiter left a manager did come over after hearing what happened from the woman in the back He offered to comp my gumbo and my wife's cheesecakeCount me out from ever stepping foot in this overpriced carnival of lousy food and mediocre cheesecake I'm from NY and I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer at CostcoThe staff was nice enough incompetent but nice Glad they offered an apology and to comp part of the meal but I'm still upset that I had to pay anything after this ordealNOTE: IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALERGIES MAKE SURE TO ASK BECAUSE IT WON'T BE ON THE MENU.
The fact that Bashas is still even in business both astounds and frightens me.
Worst Espresso EVER And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold If I could give 0 stars I would.
WARNING: This location is under new management Do not trust any reviews older than 2 months This used to be one of my wife's and my top 3 favorite restaurants During the last several months we were noticing cost cutting measures being implemented such as the olive oil jars being removed from the tables and only portioned out by the staff (I can't stand referring to them as servers it feels degrading) But the food was always top notch Then suddenly about 2 months ago the management was replaced because apparently the cost cutting measures weren't enough Now this is a completely different experience Honestly if I had never eaten here before the food would be good if it was a $14 per person restaurant But compared to what it used to be and the fact that if you order an appetizer it's at least $25 per person "never again" I'll start with the calamari appetizer Once lightly breaded and perfectly tender it is now over done bland and artless The previously chunky mouth watering marinara dipping sauce was watered down and soupy My personal favorite Ricardo sauce used to have loads of fresh sliced peppers and tang now it tasted only of melted butter with a couple of diced veggies on top and left a film in my mouth My wife's salad tasted the same as always but my sausage lentil soup was suddenly mealy and lacked the flavor I used to crave We ordered the sirloin marsala and while the taste was similar the sauce was thin and my steak was noticeably tougher Also they only had one vegetable selection instead of two or three like always If you didn't like broccoli that night you were out of luck In short while decent if it was a cheap Italian dinner on the go the recent cost-cutting changes to the menu render this $25 per person restaurant a no fly zone.
This course has gone down hill drastically  They are under new management but the course is not maintained at all or at least very little  If your looking to get out and just practice then it is fine  The fairways are turning to dirt and the greens are really bad  I play there because it is close but as in another review you get what you pay for  The prices for the course are too high  I don't know what happened from last year but I am looking to golf somewhere else.
Have had my oil changed here before It's fine But today they decided that they wouldn't accept company checks This with advertisements on their marquee and on a banner in their shop that the offer "fleet services" I am the owner of a construction company and I do not give my employees company credit cards I don't know of other businesses that have a "fleet" of vehicles that give their employees cards Makes no sense So I drove to a different jiffy lube location which accepted my company check  which makes no sense either but I got my oil changed so that's something.
I've definitely seen better Motel 6's in my lifetime We stayed for one night after my birthday party at a bar down the road HUGE MISTAKE At 105 degrees out a nice cool room would've been nice but ours didn't work - AT ALL The beds were so stiff and uncomfortable - mixed with the heat none of us slept The bed linens had burn holes (in a non smoking room) and stains that were hard and crusty looking super fresh and unwashed from the last guest Not to mention the stains on the mattress and box spring - SO GROSS We noticed the next morning that there was a ton of gnats in our window - IN THE ROOM I will never be staying at this location again.
This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star We went to have a meal before the movie and decided to try Cafe Pino The endive salad was terrible no taste and overpriced We told the waiter that we did not like it at all and he started to argue with us He said that the other table just had four of those salads and THEY LOVED IT Very arrogant I think he must have been related to the owner otherwise I think he would be fired by now All the waiters walk around looking so miserable no one smiling just rushing around No one came to our table to provide additional ice tea Overall the service stinks and the prices are inflated for what you get.
I went here after seeing a picture of their oreo pancakes on the flyer (Menu description said cocoa based pancakes with white chocolate butter creme filling and the photo actually looked like a big oreo) Sounds amazing right Well what i got was a normal buttermilk pancake with crumbled oreos and hersheys syrup on it Not cool Eggs benedict More like eggs beneDONT The yolk was hard and not runny at all Hollandaise sauce was overly lemony and the ham was probably oscar meyer Fresh squeezed orange juice was luke warmEven after comping the oreo pancakes due to false advertisement the bill was still 84 dollars for 4 people's brunch Not worth itWe were expecting great food based on their advertisements and pictures and this was just not the case Ill be having brunch at crepe bar on weekends from now on.
I have eaten at this location for free the last 8 times I've been there or ordered from themI think I'm finally done They can't get an order right to save their livesThey try I'll give em that They've re-fired my order three times to get it right more than once and they've not charges me for to go orders just to get them wrong anyway more than once TerribleIf you're looking for a place to eat that doesn't take three hours and three re-fires to get you your food you're better off staying home and ordering Jimmy Johns.
Went in on Sunday after dinner to have a nice treat Bought the yogurt and sat in the back to look at the lake and hang out with my wife We noticed on the floor what appeared to be rodent droppings ( we own hamsters and are familiar with the look) So we bring it to the attention of the employee He goes with my wife and notices the same thing we did and unsure tries to call his manager We leave and leave our number to speak with him regarding this issue He calls us back and proceeds to harass my wife and accuse us of trying to ruin his business Look we were trying to point out a potential issue and this guy calls to yell at us I will never frequent this establishment again and have already begun to tell all of my friends as to the RUDE nature of how this situation was handled.
We love supporting our local Ahwatukee restaurants and we eat out oftenprobably too often So on Friday nights it's a ritual for us to have food delivered and unfortunately in our area the only choice is pizza  We were so excited to have a local pizzeria come into the neighborhood and since their opening we have been loyal customers  That changed tonight We called Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria at 6:56  We were told 45 minutes to an hour for our deliveryno problem we thought  At 8:03 we called to make sure they had our order and we we told yes the driver left at 7:24 and sorry for the delay we should have called you we'd like to offer you $5 off your next order  That seemed fairso okay we'll wait Well at 8:34 we decided our pizza and wings weren't coming Called the restaurant (for the third time) to cancel our order Seriously who wants cold unfresh pizza and wings  We walk out to drive to another restaurant (like I said beforeanyway) and the delivery man pulls up  I ask him "how long since our food left the store"he looks at his receipt and says since 7:30  I ask "how many stops before us" and I'm told seven  So it's Friday night and Jimmy & Joe's can't deliver 8 pizzas in an hour and a half Oh and chicken wingscold undercooked (yes that's an issue) wings  Do yourself a favor get in your vehicle and drive to Nello's (always great pizza) or Native New Yorker (who isn't as good as they used to be but who is 10 times better than Jimmy & Joe's) We are happy we did.
Sorry Mark I have to mostly disagree with you on this one I do agree that they have great dogs so maybe that's why they don't actually want to adopt them and I hate to be down on an organization who is trying to do a good thing butA couple a weeks ago a friend who volunteers for the rescue had taken one of the dogs out of the kennel he is staying in and brought him to the Fat Tire Festival at Tempe Town Lake I fell in love with the little guy his name is Jalen and called my fiance to see if he'd come meet him too He did he loved him so we decided to see if we could adopt him After filling out the online application (the only way to put in an application) which took over an hour we waited the three business days they gave as the time frame that it could take to get back to us Three days passed nothing so I called and emailed them to see if they even received the application no response So I asked my friend to find out next time he went to volunteer if they had gotten it  They told him that the website must be broken because they did not receive it so I asked him to see if they got the email or voicemail NO Okaaaay what the hell Well my volunteer friend brought over Jalen to our house to meet our other dogs and cat to see if he would even fit in here They all got along just fine Seriously they all got along even with the catRobert calls me later when he gets back to the rescue and says they found my application but they still didn't call me back So we emailed them and called AGAIN Finally one and a half weeks after we filled out the online application  a woman calls me with a list of excuses of why Jalen would not be a good fit She told me that the cat is a concern that the dog is terrified of cats (even though it says on his description on their website "We haven't found anyone Jalen doesn't get along with - cats dogs humans - he's just so mild-mannered") I told her he met my cat and they were indifferent to each-other there were other excuses she had it was like she was reading them off a list Finally after being on the phone with her for a half an hour and it was obvious she didn't want to actually adopt the dog to anyone I told her I had to get back to work She then calls back ten minutes later saying that if we were okay with potty-training Jalen (apparently all of the other excuses she gave me were going to be disregarded now) that a volunteer could come over on Saturday morning to asses the situation We said absolutely see you then A senior volunteer (with the adopting powers)came over this morning everyone got along great Our pets are very loved and cared for But she had a problem with us keeping our dogs outside when it's nice out like today when we leave the house We don't think they should be crated up when it's so nice out our dogs like to be outside in our big backyard able to run around and lay in the grass/sun not in a little crate inside So she told us to keep the dogs inside when we leave the house for 30 days and see how that goes and then call them back and they would come back over to reassess and she took Jalen back to the kennel where he has been staying waiting for a good home Needless to say we were pretty disappointed that they didn't adopt to us and completely disenchanted with the organization We've adopted through a rescue before and didn't have any problems I'd try valleydogsorg or wwwakitaadvocatescom of you're looking for another rescue.
The kids play area is NASTY I like to come in to let my kids play so I can do my homework but today the play area is terribly dirty There is only 1 table that doesn't have garbage on it I came in at 4 in the afternoon and no one else was here I don't understand why the play area is this dirty  I will not be coming back to this play area even though it is right next to my house I will drive to another McDonalds  Also I ordered 2 waters and 3 yogurt parfaits and it took forever They didn't even have to make anything for me They were all standing around talking to each other I do not recommend this place for your kids to enjoy.
We thought we'd give this new place a try since we had a BOGO coupon to use  My family loves fro yo but this was not the place for us  We sampled a couple of tastes and could not get ourselves to enjoy it enough to make a bowl  The fruit toppings looked disgusting- old and just sitting in juice  The 1 employee working did welcome us in but we had to walk out without a purchase because it was so awful  This place is not going to last especially being across from one of the best run cleanest fro yo spots in the neighborhood- Kokomo  We will not be returning.
So a friend of mine went here last Friday and they were double charged  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill) "I get a 100% tips" ummyeah I think I will skip this place for sure.
The customer is not always right but when u pay for something it should be what u orderedNot something u didnt want then asked if its okthen attitude when i say no thats not what i wantedthen brought me the comepletly wrong thing after thatI went to this location on a tuesday night not very busy and had the worst service and over all experience ever at a restaurant I could write an essay on everything that happened that made me feel this way but I just want to save u time and NOT go to this location I will never ever recommend someone here.
Horrible foodBad ServiceGreat locationGood for a beer or drink nothing moreThe food is scary bad and disgusting to even look atNo flavor bland or dried outYUCKDont plan on anything other than spending the night on the tiolet iafter you eat that food.
I really cannot rate the quality of the food as I never actually got my meal After waiting for 25 minutes and asking numerous times if my order was still on its way I was told that they did not know what happened to my order but they were out of steak now I opted for a refund as I had to return to work My only suggestion don't go there if there is a chance they will be busy.
This was my third visit and my last Each time I come I try something else- thinking my last poor experience was just a fluke It's not this place just stinks This time the food was average at BEST  Though it was hot it took awhile to get out and looked like it had just been thrown on the plate The worst was the service Never have I ever tipped under 10% or had such a poor customer service experience The waitress came to take our order and then disappeared (busers brought out our food and then too disappeared) We literally had to waive her down to ask for our check and even then she never showed up again Ten minutes later we had to waive down the manager to get our check No water refills no checking on our order (when we needed items) nothing Lunch was miserable overpriced and long DO NOT BOTHER.
I recently accompanied my friend several times to the Fred Meyers Jewelry store located in Fry's Marketplace Her and her fiancee previously purchased their wedding bands from them and she wanted to get them engaged with their wedding date as a surprise to him When we dropped them off she asked would their be a problem with them being engraved and she was informed no their wouldn't be We looked around the store some more and discussed making another purchase My initial thought after this visit was that it was a very casual and a little unprofessional for my liking in a jewelry store The following week we returned to pick up the bands The engraving on her 14K gold band was clear and done well Her fiancee's band however appeared to be barely legible She asked why that is and she was informed that the person the bands were sent to outsourced to someone else because of the titanium material made him nervous She asked why no one called her and informed her it would be a problem or told her initially The saleswoman then became confused and said she could ask if they could engrave it again My friend pointed out to her that she just said because of the material it was already difficult to engrave She said she would ask if it could be done again The manager then took notice of the disagreement and he came over He mentioned with his loop he could see the engraving He then discussed with the jeweler and confirmed it couldn't be done My friend asked if his staff is aware of that He said yes and she informed him that that wasn't the case and that she is dissatisfied with her experience Here is where things took a turn The manager got defensive and then asked my friend why she didn't ask   This is when I  interjected that he was out of line and she isn't the expert his staff is suppose to be I also pointed out that an engraving shouldn't take a loop like he pointed out to see It defeats the entire reason for having an engraving If no one was able to read it what was the point And his not communicating has unnecessarily devalued the ring It was her decision to make not their's His blaming the customer approach is horrendous service and why I will never make a purchase there He then informed my friend that he would only charge her for one engraving We immediately left The thing that bothers me beyond the lack of his staff being informed or that he took no accountability is that it was their wedding bands They have blemished their experience  unnecessarily with this horrific service If you have an option I encourage you to seek out another jewelry store.
I hate giving bad reviews but I have been three times now and hated it every time The pizza has been soggy and the toppings fall off the crust Crust is not good Ordered salad w/ pine nuts on it and we got a whole two (2) yes we counted carefullyGreat beer selection but otherwise meh Other reviews seem okay so go and check it out you might love it Just putting in my vote.
I'm just writing this review on the MMA & Boxing fights they have every so often I believe a referees that was there when he told me it's all about the money here that they don't give a damn about the kids fighting the fighters were 18 and up so they were adults but the ref that gave me this info had been in this business for a while and didn't like what he was seeing And he was right guys that were there to fight MMA had to box only or go home Then they were put against guys 30 to 40 pounds over there weight maybe 2 out of 10 matches were matched up correctly And the announcer didn't have info on the fighters he would look at the guy and say " he's about 5'9 or so"  Plus I had called a day ahead to find out how much to get in he said $25 and all ages and when we get there it's $30 for standing and $35 for seating plus they separated the under 21 people so half my party was split up This place was a joke There speaker systems and fans kept shutting down every 15 minutes Beers were $4 and $6 for mixed drinks  I wouldn't recommend anybody to go see a fight here.
It seems like a great deal I came here for the MLK weekend special It was $1795 for all you can play bowling laser tag etc what they don't tell you is that you will spend 2+ hours waiting to play any of the games So in the end you spend the whole night there and only get to play 1 or 2 games of anything Essentially it's a huge rip off Might as well just go to a bowling alley or laser tag place I won't be coming back for sure Also the service here is atrocious You will spend 15+ minutes at the bar just waiting to get a beer.
Complete and utter rip off  I bought tires from them had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free  Imagine that a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge  The other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free  Everything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance.
Was here yesterday and the girl running the registered rushed us saying that the cash register was timing her and that we had to hurry up and put everything on the counter Dont understand why she couldnt start ringing up the things we had up there First time i have ever been so rudely rushed to be checked out of a store Absolutely no customer service.
At about 7 pm we arrive a bunch of pilots flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance  about 14 they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes i was stokedwe are all seated outside it was such a beautiful night last night it was soo nice the waiter comes up and says hi but WE had to ASK him his name and he was way to relaxed not very outgoing at all he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his "Smoke" break my bad while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day and we all looked at the plate like um ok when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed the pizza was soo thin the toppings fell right off the pizza and there was virtually no sauce at all :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal NOPE not even close i almost wanted to cry cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined the crust was waxy and just gross the cake part tasted a little weird kinda like the crust and to mushy like they didn't give it enough time to set it was awful their menu has salad appetizers pizza and calzones and desert that's it no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal sad Over all The bathrooms were decent Parking was not to greatThe food Sucked Service could have been WAY better and it was WAY OVERPRICED if i ever go back I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon.
I always have customer service problems with Fedex  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex  But this time they really pissed me off  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services which I did  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount  (I know I do not have such an account)  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information  WTF  How much more information can I provide  Do they want my height and weight  Maybe my blood type  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children tooThis is why I say that Fedex really blows.
I waited 20 mins for my food  I approached the counter and they forgot to put my order in The managers response was "I don't know what happened" I'm never going back.
I have only been here twice but both times were not so fun  The first time was for a birthday party that included 45 guests  Now I'm not accustomed to great or even good service when there are that many people to take care of  Having worked in the restaurant industry myself I can understand the trials and tribulations that come from 45 drunken 20 somethingsHowever I do take note when 4/5 of the bills are taken care of 1 hour before the other 1/5 such that the majority of the party can move on to the next location long before the bills are received by the rest of the party  Not to mention the fact that the server was not able to then clarify the bills such that it took them FOUR attempts to get the last few bills correct attitude included  Again I thought nothing of this at first  So I went back with just the bf  The second time I went to Marcella's the server forgot to offer bread asked what we wanted to drink and never brought them and even took 30 minutes to ask us what we wanted to eat when the place was not even remotely full  Needless to say I had to fill out a comment card   I understand this is a newer restaurant in the newer area of fashion square but I'd like to think that service would be a company's first priority when opening a new restaurant  At least for me personally if the service is great I'm more likely to attribute poor food to the specific meal I picked rather than the restaurant as a whole  To end on a positive note I've heard great things about their prices for happy hour.
Sorely disappointed in our experience here on 12/12/13 so much so I'm compelled to write my first ever restaurant review on Yelp  Yes the food is very good but I would absolutely not patronize this restaurant again because of the incredibly poor service  It's truly sad as my friends and I were very excited to find that a non-chain scratch kitchen type restaurant was opening so close to our homes  We would love to support a local business  However after an absolute debauchery of a serving experience with 9 individuals in our party I'd be embarrassed to recommend or bring anyone back to this establishment  In short the wait staff is poorly trained unprofessional and also uninviting and rude  After 30+ minutes of struggling with our waiter to accurately check us out we had to call in the owner / manager  He himself was not rude however it was apparent he was also ill equipped to handle customer issues and resolve them properly  We gave ample feedback on how they can improve I hope they take it but I'm unconvinced at this point that they will  Several of us joked that the only way we would return would be for take out the food is truly good but that is where it ends  Sad as I believe they could get away with pretty low customer service with this type of menu / food just not atrocious.
I had a layover in Phoenix on Friday September 21st so I decided to get some food from Paradise in order to take on my next flight I ordered 1/2 of the southwest ceasar salad and 1/2 turkey sandwich on wheat in addition to a lemon poppysead muffin I ate the muffin and salad with no incident On the plane (after takeoff) I unwrapped my sandwich  and wedged inside the bottom portion of the bread and otherwise not visible unless the entire sandwich was unwrapped was a huge STAPLE I couldn't believe that there was a staple inside my sandwich If I had not unwrapped the sandwich and examined it (to determine if there was mayo on it) I could have been seriously injured by ingesting this at 30000 feet Take a close look before eating anything from here.
I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker  A couple nights ago we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door  Being the afternoon of July 4th the place was empty save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up  I ordered a cafe au lait he an iced coffee of some sort  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2% the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar  Really  $375 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes but even beyond that the coffee was weak and flavorless and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk  Lame  Sorry Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not becomePS - A $025 "service fee" is charged to all credit/debit transactions  Again lame.
How does this place have 3 stars  Impossible  I would rate it at 01 star if I could  What do you do when you've prepaid using a groupon and EVERYTHING except the watermelon looks horrendously awful and tastes just as bad  This was the most disgusting place at which I've ever eaten  In hindsight I see now that I was so absolutely in shock about how vile the "food" was that I actually PAID the 12 dollars they said I still owed with no record of a tab or receipt  When I asked why I still owe money after prepaying for the buffet (my first mistake) they said it was for the drinks and tax  Come on now 12 dollars for two teas and a diet coke with no written records (no ticket/bill/check/tab/receipt)  I must have been shell-shocked about the entirely horrible dining experience because I normally would have demanded a written account of our charges  I have never stiffed any restaurant or server nor would I start here but I do want to know what i am paying for and telling me "$12 for drinks and tax" is not sufficient  To THEM Mediterranean food means overcooked burritos flavorless lasagna very scary-looking greenish meatloaf curry spring rolls and limp fried onion rings  I will never go back    In regards to service our waiter was wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a baseball cap on backwards  Really  If possible I have to write a second review to lower their rating because somebody needs to warn everyone what a tremendously terrible experience they will have if they eat at this place  My only saving grace was that I was with three great friends and they were enjoyable  All of us agreed that it was not at all good One of my friends helped us wash away the bad taste by treating us to The Gelato Spot afterward which will be a whole different review and a yummy one at that.
Yes Abu J I will elaborate Just for you$6 burger Fail  you probably cost 35¢ to make and you were coldSoggy french fries Fail  How do you F up fries SrslySprite lacking Co2 Fail  It is NOT hard to reattach a new tankCustomer Service Fail   I don't appreciate being scowled at while handing over moneyAnd honestly I never liked this place its crap IMO.
We went there last night had an almond joy milkshake which tasted terrible we shared a half size and couldn't even drink it The burger was ok in n out makes a better burger for a lot cheaper.
Very cheesey especially for knowledgeable adults  I find it hard to believe that savvy young people would find it very interesting as the displays are dated and technologically out of date  Our space program's history deserves much better.
This company is terrible  Legalized crime  I paid $400 + a month for insurance for my 3 children and was denied benefits for them  They have no pre existing conditions and are very healthy the first time i tried to take them to the dr while paying heath net for coverage  i was informed they had not been added to my plan I had to wait until open enrollment to add them to my plan ok i thought my healthy kids can wait open enrollment time came  i filled out all the required forms sent it in on time only to find out 4 months later they were not added  I called Health net they said oh it's just a mistake have your employer just resubmit your forms  so my employer and i both resubmit the forms that i had originally submitted with all the dates cause i kept them  and they still denied my children coverage so thank you health net for collecting $8500 of my dollars and providing NO  coverage you are criminals I'm not understanding why you can take money and promise a service and then not have to provide any services and not go to jail You steel from people I asked others I know about who there providers are and anyone that I have met thats had health net has the same awful story to tell that I do Your employees must all have nice cars at the rate of witch you are taking advantage of people.
Let me start by saying that I used to love this place It is bright airy and the staff is very nice We were always taken care of and food came out promptly and was decent enough But the last time I was there (two Saturdays ago) I don't know what happened The place was a complete disaster an utter chaotic mess I met my friend for brunch at 11 am He was seated at the bar where we were planning on having our meal The bar is small and there were two to three people behind it at all times yet it still took a bartender at least 10 minutes to greet me and ask me for my beverage order (including my friend and me there were five guests at the bar) I ordered an iced tea and we asked for a some menus so we could order (As a former bartender you want to offer your guests menus try to build your clientele get some regulars so this was not impressive service) After about 5 more minutes we had to wave down the bartender to give her our orders We watched her write them down punch the touch screen on the bar computer and still 45 minutes later we still had no food She never talked to us never ran back to the kitchen to check on anything nor did she get a manager involved The other three people at the bar came in at the same time as us and were served in a timely manner Normally we would not wait that long for food but we set a leave time for 12:15 PM and just sort of watched the chaos of the restaurant to see how things would pan out What we noticed was an overstaffed poorly managed restaurant We watched a couple other tables complain to management about long wait times (one guy had waited an hour for his food) Finally 12:15 rolled around Still no food We gave some other girl behind the bar $5 for the tea told her we were not waiting any longer and left She looked like she had heard that from her guests before I left feeling like I just walked out of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.
Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us Ordered pupusas and fried plantain It took a while before the food came out This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here We got our foodplantain was good The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork It was alrighthad better  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity Coming from Vegas I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people  That's unheard of So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said "that's our rulesix people or more we have to include gratuity" So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people Mind youthis is within 2-3 minutes time frame their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5she kept on saying "call the manager" and was saying this rudely.
The good: Nice ambiance friendly service I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area that's the golden standard) Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket If you haven't had good chicken karage it's fried (chicken duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters) Nope this was your standard frozen then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food If I wanted frozen food I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't that shit tastes terrible) The sauce was uninspiring but hey does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out and disappointment abounds First the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket So yeah if I want supermarket food I'll just go to the supermarket Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANTWhat about the broth The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together  well let's not get too excited because once again it tastes more like powdered mix Are we sensing a theme here Lots of supermarket stuff at a premium price Sorry that's not why I go to a restaurantSo why did I even bother trying this place Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand but good at least) This was really sub-par at best the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work normally in SF) so take my ran with a grain of salt Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob YMMV.
After hearing about Morning Glory Cafe for years we were excited to go with some friends  Everything went down hill from there  The wait staff was slow and seemed put off that they had to work  The service was slow and the staff uninterested  My wife ordered the South Mountain Omelet thinking she would get some good veggies  There were a total of 9 pieces of veggies in the omelet all cut to about 1 and a half inches long  There were 2 pieces of asparagus 2 pieces of string bean 2 pieces of carrot strips and 2 paper thin pieces of pepper along with 1 tiny piece of the end of a broccoli floret  The omelet was luke warm  I ordered the Morning Glory Benedict  The eggs were close to hard boiled with 7 small pieces of "Home Fries" and my meal was also luke warm at best  Our small overpriced OJ's ($350 each) were slightly cool not cold  Overall the service was poor to fair the food was fair to poor and the prices very high given what you get.
This place was terrible  I came in here for the first time and they rushed throughout the whole service and was VERY rude when you asked them to correct something  The guy who was doing my nails did not buff out my nails and only put nail polish on half of my nail  I can understand mistakes can happen however being RUDE TO THE PAYING CUSTOMER IS INEXCUSABLE Here's a tip to the owner---TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER & GET SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO GIVE PROPER MANICURES.
Went there today to have my favourite beer and maybe some fish and chips - the place is closed with a chain and padlock round the door handles - closed for good I understand.
Our family decided to give Cibola Vista another chance in August 2012 after a horrible experience the first time we visited there in 2010Our first mistake was in thinking that maybe things had changed over the two years since our last visit they changed alright We thought that it could not get worseWe also wrongly thought that getting the very best high end penthouse suite would help sweeten the experience WRONG The room was a disaster dirty smelly no WI-fi some kind of biological or other fluid all over the TV remote with only half of the light bulbs working urine still sitting in the toilet air-conditioner only cooled the room to 85 degrees after 6 hours The  towels and linens were dingy and smelly The washer and dryer was completely inoperable and the sudden gushing stream of water from the rooftop AC condenser unit into our bathtub at 11:30pm did not bother us as the "adults" partying in the unit below us and wandering around the resort in a drunken stupor were louder than the flood in our unit  When we called the front desk to complain we were politely told that they were sorry and would have someone look into it  5 days later still partying loudly The incessant barking dogs left locked into units barked all night and day did not seem so bad after the copious amounts of vomit  still left in the elevator at  11:30 am one morning from the partying the night before People just leave their trash sitting in the hallways hoping someone will take it to the dumpsters for them The BBQ grills are not  cleaned frequently as there was left over fish of some kind all over both of the ones by our unit three days in a row There were no recirculation pumps for the hot water system so it took forever for the water to get hot in the mornings and our whole unit was absolutely infested with crickets Live crickets were in the toilets sinks showers bed hallways within the unit and DON"T open the lower cabinets if you don't like bugs We had to sweep up dead bugs every morning before starting our day The pool while looking inviting was disappointingly warm with the skimmers not appear to be working lots of unrecognizable floating debris and green slime around where the water level in the pool was But even that was comforting compared to the boisterous behavior of the unsupervised unruly drunken fools in the pool it was not even safe enough to let my 5 year old daughter  into the pool The teenage inexperienced "lifeguards" that were supposed to be on duty were so busy hiding from the situation behind the slide that they could not have helped anyone anywayIf you are looking for a dirty trashy nasty place to party like a Porkey's style college dorm then this is your placeIf you are looking for a family vacation in a reasonably clean and quiet location look elsewhere as Cibola Vista is a dump with management maintenance facility and customer service issues Very dis-pleased that this is how my time-share money is managedWe will never return to this facility.
I don't know why everyone gives the store in Tempe a good review I just went today to make a simple purchase of a table and chair for my grandson and it was a nightmare I have never liked the layout of IKEA finding it confusing and illogical Sure enough I was trying to find the children's section No signs and no sign of anyone work working on the floor I wander around and finally find it pick out what I want and get a shopping cart That's where I hit my first major snag The cart doesn't wheel right It goes all over the place I decide to ditch it and get one in self service figuring they have to have them there also Of course they don't because that would be logical I happen upon one that was left there and guess what That one also doesn't wheel right Like the other one it wheels all over the place I can barely control it I press on tho to get my items and can't find one of them but there are workers there so I ask one about the missing item He has to call someone in that dept Really You can't just help me find the right bin While I'm waiting I find the item myself and struggle to get the cart to one of only two cashiers working To get the sale price of my items I find out I have to belong to the IKEA family At this point I don't want to belong to this moronic family but I want my discount I'm told I have to join at the kiosk Its pointed out to me by a worker running from me Nice I can't get the kiosk to work No help around now Another customer asks the cashier who gives us forms to fill  out to get the card Apparently after you go to the kiosk you have to fill out this paperwork for the card anyway Huh And why didn't the cashier tell me that in the first place I'm now beginning to suspect the workers are sadists who like to see us sufferI purchase my items but now I have to figure out how to get my uncontrollable cart out of the store and to my car I find that heaving the cart away from me gets it to move the most feet I crash it into a wine rack I don't care there are no workers around anyway I heave it some more and manage to get it out the door to my car It took me an hour and a half to purchase a simple table and chair I don't plan on visiting my new 'family' ever again.
Sorry but once again I don't get it This is a nice place salsa out of pumpsoh you fancy huh This is within walking distance from the new pad I went against my better judgementkicking and screaming mind you Decided to give this place another go or 5maybe this location is better The first time we tried it they were closed the second time we barely made it No carne asada No chile relleno Why God why must you toy with me This place is NOT the best placethe green sauce isn't green at all it's GREY people You know what makes it that color Flourmore like gravy You like the tortillas I could care less really its a super large thin tortilla there's nothing special about it CALM DOWN The kid behind the counter tells me to try the breakfast thats their specialty My 3rd Carolinas attempt was for breakfast and once again I was very underwhelmed I have tried basically everything on the menu all this stuff is pretty basic and a major let down The rice and beans are good fyi.
This place must have an insect infestation About a month ago my sister ordered take out and found a cricket in her almond chicken When she called and confronted them about the situation they showed no remorse or shock The next day she took the food back What is really disburing about this is that when I shared the story with my best friend she said she had a fly on her plate several years ago I will never eat here again.
I used to LIKE this location bcz it was close About 6 wks ago they ran out of Thera Balls which I and many others use to warm up do ab exercises and stretch About a mo ago I asked when they would be replaced and was told they were on back order After sev'l wks I asked again This time the guy at the desk basically barked at me and said they had just "popped" the wk before I told him that they actually had been out for at least several weeks He then proceeded to yell at me in front of several trainers and employeesnot cool Customer service Zero I bought my own ball and am now going to another gym Good luck doing well in this economy when superior product and customer service is king.
they charge a 10% restocking fee The employees will not tell you about it till you bring the item back even if you ask about the return process.
Not good  I used to eat here regularly but haven't been to Malees in a couple years  It has REALLY gone downhill  Bad food terrible service and an overall disappointment  :( Not going back.
Created a YELP page because I was annoyed with this place Maybe they have great coffee but thats not my beef with them I saw they were listed as a great place to smoke a cigar and have a cup of jo Understanding that some great places do not allow cigars (4Peaks The Yardhouse) I called them and said "I understand you guys are cigar smoker friendly'' The woman on the phone answered "Yes" When I inquired on a smoking area she said "Just keep them as far away from us as possible" RudeThats not "cigar smoker friendly" at all A simple "Actually we do discourage patrons from smoking cigars" would have sufficed I would have even still went for a simple cup of coffeeAgain maybe their coffee is greatbut I'll never know for sure now Drink Lux.
meh it was ok hot yoga  hard to find.
the service was horrible We walked in & they looked at us like we were from another planet One guy (the cook) couldn't help not taking his eyes off us which was very uncomfortable No one said anything to us for a couple of minutes not a hello or anything Finally a female host came & sat us I will say she was the only polite warm & friendly person in there to us We couldn't help but notice the service others were getting around us It seems to me they were a bit more friendly to other guest On our way out we did not get a thank you goodbye or please come again RUDE RUDE RUDE The my fries were cold & hard.
This gym needs a remodel It is so outdated for the area and clients that consistently come here If they even read these do something with this place There are way better places popping up now and I more and more likely will be changing soon this isnt worth $30 a month.
NASTY Manager should be looking around at his dirty restaurant instead of making small talk with his employees I've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in such horrible condition I hope we don't get sick from eating here tonightAtmosphere was aweful too Industrial looking and unfinished looking What's with the big screen TVs at some tables running sweet tomato ads the whole timeI LOVE Sweet Tomatoes but I will be bookmarking this location as a Don't Ever Go There Again place.
I really had high hopes for this place My cousin and I both ordered an iced chai There was so much milk in it you could barely taste a hint of the chai We both thought it tasted like cereal milk Two sips and we tossed both our drinks What a waist of almost $9 I might go back and try a regular coffee but until then 1 star remains.
You know when you see someone and they look really good and you think they are cool and want to hang out with them and halfway through your first conversation with them you realize that they really don't have a character and they are really nothing but looks This is exactly what RA is for sushi Lots of fanfare and no essence.
I have attended this club sporadically since it opened sometime in 2010 It has had its up's and down's in terms of basic club/bar service it may depend on what night you attend  My main complaint is that If you ever need to contact someone of authority at this club (don't even bother) But say you Lost/left something behind at the club Had and altercation with a bouncer Were double charged by the bartended on your credit card  Have a complaint Have a compliment  The staff is uncooperative and rude no matter what your situation isId stay away from this club there are other bars and clubs that cater to the same patrons I always feel welcomed to spend my money everywhere/anywhere else in Phoenix.
This restaurant is WAY over priced for the quality of food presented  Starting with the salad the flavor of the ranch dressing was off bad after taste  The halibut cheeks had no flavor and tasted like cardboard  The rice pilaf tasted like Uncle Ben's and the veggies were way over cooked and cold  No redeeming value for anything on the plate  Save your time AND money It's not worth the walk downstairs.
Worse food and service I've ever experienced Extremely rude people work hereThey were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay.
Makes the olive garden look five star Despite their claims they most certainly are not using all fresh ingredients and the food is bland bland bland with a metric ton of garlic The pizza is awful and overpriced When I complained they comped me $25( which is nearly twice the price of a pizzeria bianco's pizza) at which point I gave them another try The lasagna was so bland the salad was absolutety Spartan All the way around avoid this place You'd enjoy Italian from fuzzolis better.
They do live music here and my band was scheduled to play recently In the email in which we were booked we stated that two of the band members are under 21 but they are 20Now we have played at many venues around the Valley and it has NEVER been a problem They put big black "X"s on our hands or wrist bands whatever and we ALWAYS follow the rules Once we arrived they were in frickin' SHOCK AND AWE that we would even be there because of our age The owner came out to "talk" to us more like demean us and told us we can play at 1am when the liquor license people wouldn't come in Before he did this we had offered to stay outside and only go to the stage and out very politelyBut even after that the owner felt the need to tell us that we obviously don't care about his business but its WHAT PAYS FOR HIS KIDS SHOESCan't imagine how a dump like that even pays for shoes So we politely declined to stay and do something illegal and leftYou're right NOW we don't care.
Have been for lunch during the week several times and it was worth putting up with the consistently rude and horrible service for the quick and good and cheap food     Went today for early Sunday dinner and will not go back   Service was beyond horrible and food just OK at best   Also too expensive for what you get    I don't need to spend thirty dollars to be treatedrude.
Always a favorite spot last night the Cantina Laredo Fajita's for four were charged as if for 8 server couldn't fix the bill Then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late It was a critically ill friends birthday - and I didnt not want to make a big deal Boycott.
What a horrible place Low class and higher than expected prices The lady that I spoke with was rude and frankly disagreed with everything I said She wouldn't leave me alone either When she told me that I was stupid I had had enough and just walked out.
Heard nice things about Five Guys and tried to go while I was in Portland but didn't make it I found out about the new location in Surprise and paid a visit   I went on a Saturday about 12:30 which was probably a mistake The place was packed and it took about 25 minutes to get my order You could hardly hear the numbers called because of the music and crowd noise  The food tasted ok but is a bit messy to eat It has good portions but I paid $1313 for the bacon/ cheese burger with large fries no drink so it's a bit spendy It's probably not a place I would go to again In/out burger is quicker cheaper and is not as messy to eat so I'll stick with them in the future.
I have been there twice- 2 times too many I had acrylic nails put on and they looked hideous Prices are decent for a reason The people were friendly but the actual service was horrible The nails were crooked and I had to go home and fix them myself I actually thought to myself how stupid can these people be--- it's your job Either way don't go there.
First if your a Dodgers fan you will love this park  I'm a STL fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring trainingWe went to the Friday night game and watched the Dodgers and the Giants  It was a good game and I enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats  There was over 11000 fans at the gameThe game start time was 705PM and I don't recommend going to a night game here  Getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic The concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning  The prices were typical of a major event  Food was decent  I enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $675  At the end of the game they had a post game fireworks show  It was awesome and I think it takes place on Friday's if there is a night gameOverall I won't be attending this ball park again for spring training  It doesn't give you the spring training feel  Its too big However It does offer an up close experience to the batting cages practice fields and the Dodger players around the lakeIn closing the tickets to the games are too expensive for a spring training game and it doesn't even offer a spring training experience.
dee-skusting  ate here once the food was horrible portions were microscopictry it if you don't believedon't tell me i didn't warn yousave your hard earned cash for another place and time.
I initially went to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe and was not impressed as their beers were flavorless  However my wife and I live within walking distance of this Gordon Biersch and a few months ago went there for a snack and a drink  I can't recall what I had (it was a seasonal) but it actually tasted like a decent beer  So my opinion was beginning to change  until a few weeks agoMy wife and I are from Indianapolis and we wanted to go somewhere to watch the Colts vs Bills game  We walked to GB arriving at 11:30 am (the game started at 11)  There were a total of 6 people in the restaurant taking up 2 separate tables 1 inside and 1 outside  None of the 6 people were remotely interested in any of the football games showing on the various tvs  My wife and I sat at the outside bar and asked the bartender if she could switch a tv to the Colts game as it was not on any of the tvs  She said someone had called in and requested the game showing on that tv  (I think it was Cincy)  I asked if they could change a different tv or put the Cincy game on another tv  I also remarked that no-one was here it was 11:30 and my wife and I were there and ready to spend money  She said she had to ask the Manager  The bartender returned - yes bartender - not the manager - and said "the manager said we cannot change the channels since someone called in and requested the games"  I laughed and said "well we are here ready to spend money"  Keep in mind there were multiple tvs - in the remote chance the Cincy fans arrived and wanted that game on that particulary tv there were other tvs that were not being watched that could have accomodated us or the Cincy fans  Again - only 6 people in the entire restaurant with multiple tvs - just none of them showing the Colts  (and the hapless Cards were not playing until later in the day at home)  The bartender was very professional and annoyed at the manager's decision but said there was nothing she could do  So we left  I thought it was poor management that the manager refused to change the channel and also did not have the courage to come tell usInteresting note we called BJ's and asked if they had the Colts game on  They said "no but we will put it on any channel you want"  Guess who we gave our business to  I think we spent about $50 not counting tip.
$13 for a bland large cheesesteak $13 for a bland large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for $13 for a bland large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $3Absolute and utter rip off Semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was NO ONE BEHIND USNONEVEREVERagain EVERIf I could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process I would It was shiteous Absolutely shiteousAm I making myself clear I think I am.
Worst Experience EverI went in to buy a new phone They told me they didn't have it there and would have to order it I wasn't too happy about this but they  told me it would be "like 2 to 4 days"  I ordered a phone on December 1st and after tons of phone calls that *I* made (they never bothered to check in or call me) it finally came in on the 21stWhile I understand this was in part due to the phones being on back order (how can you not know that if you work at a phone store) it was still a huge hassle for me and they didn't and WOULDN'T give me anything for my ordeal They could have thrown in some screen protectors or something and I would have been satisfied But the girl didn't offer and when I asked it was just "sorry" I was also told they could get me a better deal on my plan Did they Nope She didn't even try I hope to God I never have to deal with these people ever again and I will tell anyone I meet never to go there Ridiculous.
Probably the worst cheese steak that I ever had The meat quality was so poor There were hard pieces of fat in the meat Simply disgusting.
Overpriced and make sure you tell them your order 19 times.
We came here on a Saturday afternoon The place didn't seem very busy when we came in But the hostess did not acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes before we were finally asked how many and another few minutes before we were seated and when we were seated the server never came We had to leave after 20 minutes of sitting with no drink order & no server coming to the table It was terrible and we won't be going to the Gilbert location at San Tan any longerafter we left we went to the Chandler location and the service was excellent :).
Way to go Essence After a few awful experiences here you'd think we would learn right Remember how I said I would never go back to eat here ever again Well this morning I did And I regret itLong story short We stood in line ordered paid $30 for two breakfast items and two iced soy lattes found a table and waited And waited And waited And waited As soon as I noticed a table of four who had come in significantly later than us being delivered food and enjoying their meal I was furious Our drinks were gone and we had been sitting there for almost 40 minutes My boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was going on They didn't have our order Surprised I shouldn't have been Essence and I just weren't meant to be IT GETS BETTER  We asked for the food to go since we live 2 minutes away and we were sick of sitting there They brought out the food super fast which was a little concerning since our food hadn't been made yet right They were kind enough to load us up with some goodies but it didn't even matter because after our super short drive home we immediately opened our food from being super hungry and its was COLD Holy shit Give me a break.
I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night I went in to find a nice dress to wear After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything I asked the clerk where it was Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16Talk about being disappointed I was so upset I almost cried Shame on you You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore.
We show up to watch the Cardinals game for breakfast with the kids and this joke of a place had only two TVs in the dining area showing the Cardinals game The tables are all saved by people crowded around the two tvs this is an Arizona sports bar Really Meanwhile they have all this Cardinals signage up We always go here for games and their food is amazing but why did my fam and I have to drive to three places this morning until we found a decent place to watch the Cards game So pretty much don't go here if you want to catch a local team game on Sunday but Raiders and Steelers yep they've got thaton multiple tvs.
First off they don't even deliver Wtf Pizza is hands down the worst in surprise Ate there once and that was enough for us Service was horrible Dominos is way better.
Well I new better to come in on a Sunday 45 minutes to be seated 20 more then we were told another 45 to get our food plus they never brought the whole meal and no one asked how we were doing Bottom line it was not worth 2 hours of my life.
I saw a coupon online for $50 off so I called to get a quote on replacing my brake pads I told him the make and model of my car which is a fairly common non-luxury vehicle He said he wouldn't know the cost until he saw it and I had to bring it in He said it could be from $100 to $1000 but he wouldn't know until he did an inspection.
My wife and I eat out five nights a week  We know what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to ambiance  We booked a table for the patioand dropped German's name as he is the Gran Fromage  When we arrivedon timewe were told no tables on the patio  We were given the choice of a table in the bar or a table in the dining roomGiven that the noise level was so pronounced in the barwe opted for a dark table in the dining roomWe sat down and when the server arrived with the water we were unable to communicate with each other as the noise level was intolerable  Not chicbut NOISE  So loud we opted to boltand went to another establishmentI think German does a great job at Local Bistro and would at Central Bistro ife he got the noise level down to an acceptable levelI was most unhappy that our reservation was not carried out as specifiedbut even more disappointed that the lame assed interior DECORATOR thought the noise would be acceptableInterior designers and Architects are idiots  They will blow smoke at you and have you think they know somethingwhen in fact most all are friggin hacksWill not return to any of his restaurantsas we found the noise to be a game changerGood luck with the over 35 crowd  You'll never make it.
My wife and I ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain  But what a major disappointment  We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms  Grimaldi's is very proud of their pies with a $1600 sticker price on a basic large cheese  Toppings are $200 each  So with $2000 invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste  We like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky  Upon inspection - I pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust - we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut A total turn-off  Also the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings  I've eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an F  For starters we tried the house salad and at best it was very average  The ingredients weren't chopped/prepared professionally and the dressing was bland  We mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us  We pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took 50% off the pizza and said he hoped we'd give his store another try  But nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype and Grimaldi's gets way too much credit for basically no reason  I think I'll stick with Oregano'sor heck even Peter Piper has way better pizza.
I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarringAfter the event I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact informationAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it And speaking of rooms I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggageOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.
This place is a joke Crappy service crappy staff crappy inventory Don't bother Rude rude rude.
UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenixaboutcom/library/blrestinspectbad0613htm) Meanwhile the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my reviewOh Curry Corner  I loved you since the day I met youYour takeout orders were usually wrong  But I forgave you for each time I came inside my food was just rightI was wierded out by your self-service beverages and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks and I was OK with that because your food was so cheap and so deliciousI was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dudewtf is with his hairSERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs but this was  They cleaned it up And it looked greatWell I was pumped that my friend who is mostly an Indian food virgin enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine  So much so that (well until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked outA roach  Not a dead one  One still clinging to it's life  Legs in the air like he just didn't careI immediately bugged (ha) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner  OH he said  I saw one the last time I was there but I assumed it was just a flukeNo  It was not  And no thanks CC  I'm over you.
Let me start off by saying I had the worst service I have ever had in my life at the Barrio Our server was SO rude I went here with a friend of mine and we were completely blown away by our experience This was my first time dining at Barrio Cafe and my very last We ordered the table side guacamole and it wasn't "table side" our server made it in back and just threw it down on the table I ordered the fish taco's and my friend ordered the quesadilla  My fish tacos tasted like I was eating fish sticks wrapped in a stale tortilla SO GROSS My friends Quesadilla  was so bland how do you mess up a quesadilla  So to say the least Barrio Cafe is forever marked off my places to dine at in the city.
It was 1am on my way to Tucson and it was either this or mcdonalds i went with the hype of wanting to try this random looking place out and let's say I regret not getting the 20 pc chicken nugget @ Mcds This place was saltier than the pacific ocean Also the man charging was handling money and food at the same time whataburger *sad tone*.
I would have gave it zero stars but that wasn't an option First things first I am middle eastern and this is NOT the way authentic middle eastern food tastes like Everything was tasteless we ordered many different entrees and everything sucked I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who's looking to get an authentic middle eastern mealDisappointed.
I know little about windshields glass glass repair etcI was referred to American Glass by Tempe Auto Repair (whom I really like) when my wife's car had a cracked windshield The crack was getting dangerous and needed to be fixed American Glass is close to our home and after the referral figured that this was a good decisionI called and left a voice mail to set up an appointment No call My wife called again a few days later and the owner said there was no voice mail and maybe I called somewhere else She wasn't very friendly I had the business card and heard the American Glass message I know where I called Should have been my first warningMy wife did take her car to get the window fixed as this needed to be done rather than shop around any longer This process went pretty well and the windshield was fixed the same day The big issue was dealing with my insurance company and American Glass This process could have been handled betterWithin a month of the windshield being repaired  a rock hit my wife's windshield again and left a ding My insurance company (State Farm) advised us to contact the Glass Company to repair the windshield as this should be under warranty and be fixed without cost or little costWe contacted American Glass and we were told that it would not be covered and we would have to pay for a new windshield at full cost The woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue HMMMM Forget that State Farm informed me that any reputable glass company would stand behind their work and offer to fix the problem State Farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield (My wife will write a review on this)I would suggest that you go somewhere else when getting a new windshield repaired etc I can only warn others to steer clear of this business and the woman who runs this place.
Been shopping at Bass Pro for years back in Springfield Mo  Was in the Mesa store shopping for camo recliners  Got a young girl that was helpful but didn't know the answers to the questions I had  She got a 'more experienced' clerk/supervisor that when I asked questionsall I got was attitude  I mean really  You don't want to sell or order me a $600 chair or 2  Finally I just walked away and called Springfield and complained  The person at corp office said to stay there and they would call someone to help me  I waitedwaitedwaitedfinally left and called Springfield back  The person there had called a store in Californianot Mesa  Really Bass Pro  Get your crap togetherNow buying the chairs from Cabelas.
You can call this place Mulligan's or Maloney's or Baloney and Cheese but either way it blows as hard as the water spout of Moby Dick It could be the worst bar I have been to in Phoenix (and I've been to The Break Room) I don't know what this bar is trying to be a Pub a Dance club a Dive Talk about identity crisis Between the attendant in the small bathroom and scantily clad waitresses and the abysmal music this place is a cross section of all that is wrong with Scottsdale bars Let me explain:1  The bathroom is small do we really need a guy handing out paper towels I don't see the need for this at all in a place like Mulligan's 2 They play the worst combination of dance/ R&B and rap music People proceed to "dance" on the patio (which is no dance floor it's made of brick) and basically create fodder for the occasionally joke or innuendo to be thrown around by people like me I associated the dance floor with a train unloading cattle It seemed like steer were being brought down a ramp of train car and my friends and I were bidding on each one As the inebriated cattle walked by we were appalled by their excessiveness and complete disregard for themselves Stupid Cattle If I had a cattle prod this would have been an ideal time to zap them into early retirement for the evening  I would have been doing the entire town a favor 3 This place is dark and has a pub atmosphere but is trying to be a dance club Mulligan's suffers from the  $30000 millionaire syndrome as many young Scottsdalians do On the outside you may be wearing Hugo Boss but inside you are just a 27 year old Insurance Analyst I wouldn't set foot in the place again I am so defiant  the CIA would have to drug me and drag my hooded and shackled to this place I may even avoid the entire area this bar surrounds Like a Chernobyl this place has leaked radiation and everything around is contaminated Best line of the night from my friend "This isn't a conducive environment".
I went to the grand opening of the new location of Primp and Blow with high hopes They sent me an e-mail for the kick off event advertising free eyebrow waxing and make-up applications The e-mail was quite timely because I was in need of having my eyebrows waxed When I got there about 5:20pm they seemed quite busy and disorganized Which honestly I can understand for a grand opening so I tried to cut them a little slack When I asked the girl at the front desk about eyebrow waxing she seemed unsure what I was talking about said she would write down my name and ask that I should check back with her in 10-15 minutes When I checked back the next girl I talked to had put me on the list and said it would be about 15 minutes to just come and check back at the desk After another 15 minutes I checked back and got the same response This happened a few times I finally was taken back to have my eyebrows waxed around 6:20pm Yes an hour after I got there Thnakfully they had some yummy food and good music for the grand opening so still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here The girl that took me back never introduced herself so I do not know the name of the person I am reviewing At the very beginning I explained to her my brows are very simple I just do a little underneath and a little in between my brows I told her I didn't need shaping just keep the shape I have and clean up the hair underneath my brow The first thing she does is put wax ABOVE my eyebrow As you know once wax is applied there is only one way it is coming off :-( So she waxed the top of one brow even though I specifiaclly told her just underneath and between Yikes but can't undo it nowThen she does between and underneath does a quick pluck of a few strays and says she is done Um okI've never had them not hand me a mirror when they are done bad sign So I hop up to look in the mirror only to find out that she went way thinner than the natural shape of my brows Way thinner than I ever go When I mention this to her she say "wow and I never shape I just follow the line of the brow" Wellthat's not true because mine are now scary thin =( Nothing I can do to get them back but just wait And hope they grow back in the way I used to have them So while I was clearly not happy with my thin brows (even though I am still trying as best I can to be nice at this point) I didn't even receive an apology from her Nothing I was very disappointed in my experience here and will not be returning to have anything waxed in the futureOn a side note a few friends went that night for blowouts and make-up applications They were split A couple liked their hair and not their make-up a couple liked their make-up and not their hair And one friend left nearly in tears because she hated both her hair and make-up so much Not so great for opening night when you are trying to do your best to get return customers.
Good food but horrible stuffy and pretentious atmosphere  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation  When we said no she huffed and acted very put off  Once we were seated the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal  Have dined here multiple times  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy "wealthy grandmother" like atmosphere any longer.
Ordered pork tacos cost around $12 Cold tasted like Taco Bell not good quality food I think they pre-make the food the tacos were wrapped in foil I didn't eat it.
Order new Pretzel cheeseburger with fries  Burger was cold and disgusting and fries were cold and rubbery  It's a hit or miss with this Wendy's  I should of driven further and gone to a different one.
Almost as bad as Oakland  Constant gate changes (and the terminals are not anywhere close to each other)  We flew there headed to Puerto Vallarta and our gate changed twice - from B to A and then back to B  Fortunately there was a long layover  On the way back it changed twice in B and then to A - we almost didn't make our flightSecurity takes forever  They pull over the single brown man to double check his bag  They allow first class passengers to bypass the security line holding everyone else up  Then they allow people in wheelchairs to bypass the line (which is very understandable but why do they only have two x-ray lines open) There are tons of grouchy older people there  I like old people but the grouch/entitlement level was comperable to Dulles  People are freaking rudeIt is NOT the friendliest airport anywhere - unless you compare it to Oakland  Compared to Oakland it's not so bad but I still won't be flying through Phoenix again.
Well I got this chocolate as a present for Valentines When I met the "chocolatier" I was with an African American friend  She completely ignored my friend  She didn't know that my friend purchased her chocolate as a gift for me through a Living Social deal  I love chocolate  I have purchased gourmet truffles including raw chocolate from chocolatiers in different parts of the country  Some of my favorites have been in Portland OR Orange County Ca and San Francisco CA  Her chocolate was my least favorite  Almost every truffle has been out of balance with unusual aftertastes  I am simply not a fan  I doubt that either of us will every buy this product again.
Yesterday (16 June 2013) my son visited Rosie McCaffrey's He ordered a hamburger and a small pitcher of beer When he attempted to pay his debit card was declined He asked me to go by and take care of the bill Upon my arrival (16 June 2013 1800hrs) I spoke with bartender "Sam" who refused to take my debit card stating she had paid cash out of her pocket She was unable to explain why she couldn't use my card and take cash from the register I told her I'd write her a check then because I had no cash She refused a check Eventually Sam told me there was an ATM outside I obtained cash from the ATM and returned to pay the bill of $1408 Then Sam refused to give me a receipt for the $2000 I gave her ($1408 plus tip) At the end of our visit she gave me my son's debit card and driver's license without even knowing who I was Needless to say no one in our family will be visiting Rosie McCaffrey's again.
The food was meh at best the service was deplorable I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast First the biscuits came out when they served my fiancé his dinner Then came the steak and part of the eggs The remain egg and hash browns came out By the time I was served my fiancé was nearly finished  Our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating When I asked for a to go box she took my plate and didn't return for quite a while When she came back she asked if I wanted a box for my biscuits I asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away She then said "I thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits" which made no sense She then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but I would have gladly paid the extra $6 to leave Both she and the manager said that they hadn't scheduled a cook and 2 waiters The waitress said she was triple booked at her station  I don't see this as the waitresses issue but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions What kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a Friday night and doesn't have all of his staff working This was our fist and last visit to BBD.
Despite the fact that this bar is getting one star you should go there and soon Mostly because it won't be open long Friend won a "VIP" party Yay let's goTurns out that means four dollar domestic drafts and two dollars off well drinks Wow Lookout we got a crazy night coming They seat us in the corner and the six of us order a drink We practiced conversing for about 25 minutes before 4 beers and two drinks arrived 66% accuracy rate Nothing really improved after this Lame waitress was incredibly slow to bring drinks and take orders It was lame Especially when it was not too busy in the bar A bouncer type guy brought us two of our drinks after we asked him to get us our waitress After we decided to move on it took them over 15 minutes to bring our cards back WTF If you like being ignored and crunching ice with your teeth instead of drinking the beer you ordered this is your new spot Hurry while the horrible service has that new bar smell.
This place is garbage First of all it was impossible to hear the employee through the speaker at the drive through Besides that I made a really simple order and even that was messed up Immediately noticed that part of the order was missing They took the bag of food from me to fix the order We sat there in the drive thru line for what seemed like ten minutes A six+ car line had formed behind me They finally came back to the window with another bag claiming that the issue had been fixed We did a quick check to see that we had the correct amount of food and it appeared to have been corrected When we got home we realized the order was wrong again/still and the breakfast sandwiches looked like someone sat on them They were extremely smashed The other part of my order was the coffee I asked for three coffee's Two regular one decafe The employee asked me if I wanted the coffee to be hot Yes of course I do He told me there was no hot coffee and that I would have to wait for a new brew To make a long story short the coffee was cold and watered down Avoid this location Horrible This was my first time ever going to this location and my last.
WHOEVER RUNS THIS PLACE SHOULD BE FIREDWent here for the Eric Church concert and there was literally a will-call/entry line for 2+  hours  They are seriously understaffed/have just 2 will call windows the guys checking IDs were soooooooo slow/drunk/chewing a wad of tobacco about the size of a baseball  The beer lines were shameful  No air conditioning Can only use your credit card one time () so have to have a tab etc  Overall an ugly black mark on the Scottsdale/Phoenix music scene  I'd be ashamed to play here/own this place.
Horrible the bartender kept blowing us off he was more concered about talking to other staff members then assisting paying customer food was gross stay away.
